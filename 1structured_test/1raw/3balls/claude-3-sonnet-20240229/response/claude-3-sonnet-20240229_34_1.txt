To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2, respectively.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of possible outcomes is given by the combination formula: C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 8!/(2!*6!) = 28.

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Since the balls are distinguishable, the order in which they are distributed matters.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls is C(6, 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4, 2) = 6.
The remaining 2 balls go to C.
Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90.

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls is C(6, 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4, 3) = 4.
The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Since the number of outcomes for case 1 (90) is greater than the number of outcomes for case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
