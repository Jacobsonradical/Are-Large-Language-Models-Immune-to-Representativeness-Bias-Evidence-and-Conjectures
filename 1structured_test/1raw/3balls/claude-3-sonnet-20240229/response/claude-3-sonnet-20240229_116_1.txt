To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
For this case, we need to distribute 2 balls to each child, and there is only one way to do that.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 1

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
For this case, we have the following possibilities:
- A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball
- A gets 2 balls, C gets 3 balls, and B gets 1 ball
- B gets 2 balls, A gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball
- B gets 2 balls, C gets 3 balls, and A gets 1 ball
- C gets 2 balls, A gets 3 balls, and B gets 1 ball
- C gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and A gets 1 ball

There are 6 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2.
Number of ways for Case 2 = 6

Since there are more ways to obtain Case 2 than Case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.
