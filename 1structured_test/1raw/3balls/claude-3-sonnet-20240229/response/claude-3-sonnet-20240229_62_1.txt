To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) for each case and then compare the counts.

Total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children = 6! = 720 (permutations of 6 objects)

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1 (since there are no choices left)
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1 (since there is no choice left)
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the total number of ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the total number of ways for Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
