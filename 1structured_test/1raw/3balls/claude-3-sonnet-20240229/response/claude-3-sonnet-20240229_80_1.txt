To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute 2 balls to each child.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute 2 balls to one child, 3 balls to another child, and 1 ball to the remaining child.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with one child getting 2 balls, one child getting 3 balls, and one child getting 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to obtain Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
