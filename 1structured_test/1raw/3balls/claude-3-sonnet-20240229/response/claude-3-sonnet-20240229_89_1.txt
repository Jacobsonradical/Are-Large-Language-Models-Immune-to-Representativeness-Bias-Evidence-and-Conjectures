To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To find the number of ways each case can occur, we need to use combinations.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = Combination(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = Combination(8, 2) = 8!/(2!×6!) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of ways for Case 1 = Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 2) × Combination(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
In Case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways for Case 2 = Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 3) × Combination(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Number of ways for Case 1 (90) > Number of ways for Case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
