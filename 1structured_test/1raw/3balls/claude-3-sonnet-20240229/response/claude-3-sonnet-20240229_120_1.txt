To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of ways in which the 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed among the three children, and then find the number of ways for each case (case 1 and case 2) to occur. The case with a higher number of possible outcomes will be more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula:

Total number of ways = (6 + 3 - 1)! / (6! * (3 - 1)!) = 28

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C. The number of ways to do this is:

Number of ways for Case 1 = 6!/(2!*2!*2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C. The number of ways to do this is:

Number of ways for Case 2 = 6!/(2!*3!*1!) = 10

Since the number of ways for Case 1 (15) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (10), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
