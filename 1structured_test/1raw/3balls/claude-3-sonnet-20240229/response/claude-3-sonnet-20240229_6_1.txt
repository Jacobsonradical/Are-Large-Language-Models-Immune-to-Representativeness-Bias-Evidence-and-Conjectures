To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This case represents the situation where each child gets 2 balls.

To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we need to first choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 available balls. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
Next, we choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in (4 choose 2) = 6 ways.
The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 1 to occur is 15 × 6 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This case represents the situation where child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we first choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 available balls. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
Next, we choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.
The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.
Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 2 to occur is 15 × 4 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, we can see that Case 1 has more possible outcomes (90) than Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
