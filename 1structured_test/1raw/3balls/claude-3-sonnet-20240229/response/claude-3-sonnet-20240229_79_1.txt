To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90 (since there are 2 balls each for A, B, and C in Case 1)

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
Number of ways for Case 2 = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 30

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Case 1 has 90 ways, and Case 2 has 30 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
