To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this distribution, we can think of it as dividing the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2! × 4! × 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this distribution, we can first choose 3 balls for child B, then 2 balls for child A, and the remaining ball goes to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × 1 = (6 × 5 × 4) / (3! × 2!) × 3 = 60

Since there are more ways to get the distribution in case 2 (60 ways) than in case 1 (15 ways), we can conclude that case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
