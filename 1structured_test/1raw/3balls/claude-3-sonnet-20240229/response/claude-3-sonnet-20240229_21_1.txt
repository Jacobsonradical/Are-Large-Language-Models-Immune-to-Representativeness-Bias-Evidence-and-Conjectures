To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then count how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2, respectively.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of outcomes is the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 distinct recipients (children).
This can be calculated using combinations with repetition:
Total number of outcomes = C(6 + 3 - 1, 6) = C(8, 6) = 8! / (6! × 2!) = 28

Step 2: Count the number of outcomes corresponding to case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2).
In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. There is only one way to distribute the balls in this case.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = 1

Step 3: Count the number of outcomes corresponding to case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
In case 2, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 balls and 1 ball, respectively.
There are 3 ways to choose the child who gets 3 balls (A, B, or C).
For each of these 3 cases, there are 3 ways to choose the child who gets 2 balls.
Number of outcomes for case 2 = 3 × 3 = 9

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = 1
Number of outcomes for case 2 = 9

Since there are more outcomes corresponding to case 2 than case 1, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
