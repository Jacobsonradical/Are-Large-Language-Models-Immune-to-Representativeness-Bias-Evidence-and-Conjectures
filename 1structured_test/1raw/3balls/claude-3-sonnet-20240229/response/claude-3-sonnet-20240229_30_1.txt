To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To find the number of possible outcomes for each case, we can use combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls in C(6, 2) ways.
Then, we can choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls in C(4, 2) ways.
The remaining 2 balls will be for C.
Number of possible outcomes for Case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We can choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls in C(6, 2) ways.
Then, we can choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls in C(4, 3) ways.
The remaining 1 ball will be for C.
Number of possible outcomes for Case 2 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Since there are more possible outcomes for Case 1 (90) than Case 2 (60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
