To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) for each case and compare their probabilities.

Given:
- Total number of balls = 6
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
There are 6 ways to choose 2 balls for A (6C2), 4 ways to choose 2 balls for B (4C2), and 2 ways to choose 2 balls for C (2C2).
Number of ways for Case 1 = 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
There are 6 ways to choose 2 balls for A (6C2), 4 ways to choose 3 balls for B (4C3), and 1 way to choose 1 ball for C (1C1).
Number of ways for Case 2 = 6C2 × 4C3 × 1C1 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children.
Total number of ways = Number of ways for Case 1 + Number of ways for Case 2
Total number of ways = 90 + 60 = 150

Step 4: Calculate the probabilities for each case.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 150 = 0.6 or 60%
Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways = 60 / 150 = 0.4 or 40%

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
