To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Number of ways for Case 1:
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
Similarly, for child B, there are 15 ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls.
For child C, there is only 1 way to choose the remaining 2 balls.
Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 15 × 1 = 225

Number of ways for Case 2:
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
For child B, we need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.
For child C, there is only 1 way to choose the remaining 1 ball.
Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the number of ways for Case 1 (225) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
