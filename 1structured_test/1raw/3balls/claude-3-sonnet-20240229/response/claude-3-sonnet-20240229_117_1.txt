To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, and then determine how many of those cases correspond to case 1 and case 2, respectively.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total cases = (6 + 3 - 1)! / (6! * (3 - 1)!)
            = 9! / (6! * 2!)
            = 9! / (6! * 2)
            = 84

Now, let's count the cases that correspond to case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

For case 1, there is only one way to distribute the balls:
6 balls => 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, 2 balls to C

For case 2, there are multiple ways to distribute the balls:
6 balls => 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, 1 ball to C
           2 balls to A, 3 balls to C, 1 ball to B
           2 balls to B, 3 balls to A, 1 ball to C
           2 balls to B, 3 balls to C, 1 ball to A
           2 balls to C, 3 balls to A, 1 ball to B
           2 balls to C, 3 balls to B, 1 ball to A

So, there are 6 cases that correspond to case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
