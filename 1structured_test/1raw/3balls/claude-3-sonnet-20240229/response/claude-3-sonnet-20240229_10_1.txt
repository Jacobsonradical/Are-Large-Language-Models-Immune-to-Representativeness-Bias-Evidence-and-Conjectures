To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to obtain each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
For this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each.
The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
For this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into one group of 2 balls, one group of 3 balls, and one group of 1 ball.
The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that Case 1 has more possibilities than Case 2.
