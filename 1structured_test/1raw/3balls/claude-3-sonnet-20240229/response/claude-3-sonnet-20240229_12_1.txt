To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to obtain each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this case, we need to distribute the balls in such a way that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is calculated using combinations.

Number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 balls = C(6, 2) = 6!/(2!×4!) = 15
Since there are three children, we need to consider the arrangements of distributing the balls among them.
Number of arrangements = 3! = 6

Therefore, the total number of ways to obtain Case 1 = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To obtain this case, we need to distribute the balls in such a way that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball. We can calculate this in the following way:

Number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 balls = C(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls = C(4, 3) = 4
Number of arrangements of distributing the balls among the three children = 3!

Therefore, the total number of ways to obtain Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 6 = 360

Since the total number of ways to obtain Case 2 (360) is greater than the total number of ways to obtain Case 1 (90), Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
