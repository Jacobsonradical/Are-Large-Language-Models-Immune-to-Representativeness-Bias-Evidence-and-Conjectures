To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children A, B, and C, and then compare the number of outcomes corresponding to each case.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multiplication principle:
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
To obtain this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1 (since there is no choice left)
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
To obtain this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1 (since there is no choice left)
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the number of outcomes for each case:
Case 1: 90 outcomes
Case 2: 60 outcomes

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
