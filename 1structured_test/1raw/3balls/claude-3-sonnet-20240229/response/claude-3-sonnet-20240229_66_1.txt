To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 1.
We have 6 balls and 3 groups (A, B, and C), each getting 2 balls.
Number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 balls each = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2.
We have 6 balls and 3 groups (A, B, and C), with A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball.
Number of ways to distribute 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1 = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 60

Step 3: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Case 1 has 90 ways, and Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
