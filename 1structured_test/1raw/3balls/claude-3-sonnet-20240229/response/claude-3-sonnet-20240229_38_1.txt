To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = Combinations of 6 things taken 3 at a time = (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 20

Step 2: Find the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = Combinations of 6 things taken 2 at a time = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 2 balls = Combinations of 4 remaining balls taken 2 at a time = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways for C to get the remaining 2 balls = 1 way
Number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Find the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = Combinations of 6 things taken 2 at a time = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 3 balls = Combinations of 4 remaining balls taken 3 at a time = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways for C to get the remaining 1 ball = 1 way
Number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Number of ways for Case 1 (90) > Number of ways for Case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
