To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = 6! (factorial of 6) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Find the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Find the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur than Case 2, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
