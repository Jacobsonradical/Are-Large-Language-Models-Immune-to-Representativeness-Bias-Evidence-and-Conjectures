To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To calculate the probability of each case, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

Total number of possible outcomes = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls: 2C2 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Probability of Case 1 = 90 / 720 = 1 / 8

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball: 1C1 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Probability of Case 2 = 60 / 720 = 1 / 12

Since the probability of Case 1 (1/8) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (1/12), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
