To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case and then compare the two values.

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
In this case, we have a combination problem where we need to choose 2 balls for the first child out of 6 balls, then 2 balls for the second child out of the remaining 4 balls, and the last 2 balls go to the third child.

Number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
Here, we have a combination problem where we need to choose 2 balls for the first child out of 6 balls, then 3 balls for the second child out of the remaining 4 balls, and the last ball goes to the third child.

Number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the number of possible ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of possible ways for Case 2 (60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
