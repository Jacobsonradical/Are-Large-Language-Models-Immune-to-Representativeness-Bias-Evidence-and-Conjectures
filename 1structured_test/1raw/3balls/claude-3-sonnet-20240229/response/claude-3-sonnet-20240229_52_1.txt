To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more often, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among three children.
Total number of ways = Combination(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = Combination(8, 2) = 8!/(2!×6!) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways for case 1 = Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 2) × Combination(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways for case 2 = Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 3) × Combination(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Calculate the probability of each case occurring.
Probability of case 1 = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways = 90/28 = 0.3214 (approximately)
Probability of case 2 = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways = 60/28 = 0.2143 (approximately)

Since the probability of case 1 (0.3214) is higher than the probability of case 2 (0.2143), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
