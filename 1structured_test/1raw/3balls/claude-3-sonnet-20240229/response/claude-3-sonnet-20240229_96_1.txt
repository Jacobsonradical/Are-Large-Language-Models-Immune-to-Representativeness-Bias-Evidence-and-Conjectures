To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of possible outcomes for this case can be calculated using combinations.

Total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! × 4!) = 15
Number of ways to assign the remaining 4 balls to the other two children: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! × 2!) = 6

Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child receives 2 balls, one child receives 3 balls, and one child receives 1 ball. The number of possible outcomes for this case can be calculated using combinations and permutations.

Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls: C(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose the child who receives 2 balls: 3 (A, B, or C)
Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls: C(4, 3) = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining ball to the last child: 1

Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 3 × 4 × 1 = 180

Comparing the two cases, Case 2 has more possible outcomes (180) than Case 1 (90).

Answer: {case: 2}
