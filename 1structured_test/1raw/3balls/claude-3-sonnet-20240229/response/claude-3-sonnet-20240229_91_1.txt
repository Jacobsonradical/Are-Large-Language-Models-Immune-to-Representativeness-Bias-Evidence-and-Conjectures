To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare their probabilities.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each.
The number of ways to do this is calculated by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into one group of 2 balls, one group of 3 balls, and one group of 1 ball.
The number of ways to do this is calculated by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60 ways

Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children = C(6, 6) = 1

The probability of Case 1 occurring = 90 / 1 = 90
The probability of Case 2 occurring = 60 / 1 = 60

Since the probability of Case 1 (90) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
