To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case and then compare the results.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 2C2 = 1
Number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1
Number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Number of ways for Case 1 (90) > Number of ways for Case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) than Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
