To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, which is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 8!/(2!×6!) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for Case 1.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for Case 2.
In Case 2, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively.
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × C(3, 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for each case.
Number of outcomes for Case 1: 90
Number of outcomes for Case 2: 180

Since the number of outcomes for Case 2 is greater than the number of outcomes for Case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
