To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the number of possible outcomes for this case, we need to consider the combination of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C.

The number of possible outcomes for Case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To calculate the number of possible outcomes for this case, we need to consider the combination of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

The number of possible outcomes for Case 2 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (1! × 3!)) = 15 × 4 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that Case 1 has more possible outcomes than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
