To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This means that each child receives exactly 2 balls.

To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we can use the combination formula:
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Explanation:
- (6 choose 2) represents the ways to choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls.
- (4 choose 2) represents the ways to choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls.
- (2 choose 2) represents the ways to choose 2 balls for child C from the remaining 2 balls.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This means that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball.

To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we can use the combination formula:
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Explanation:
- (6 choose 2) represents the ways to choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls.
- (4 choose 3) represents the ways to choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls.
- (1 choose 1) represents the ways to choose 1 ball for child C from the remaining 1 ball.

Comparison:
The number of ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
