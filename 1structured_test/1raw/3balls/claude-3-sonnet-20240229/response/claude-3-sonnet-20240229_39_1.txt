To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children A, B, and C for each case, and then compare their probabilities.

Given:
- Total number of balls = 6
- Number of children = 3 (A, B, and C)
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2)
= (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) × (2! / (2! × 0!))
= 15 × 6 × 1
= 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1)
= (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (3! × 1!)) × (1! / (1! × 0!))
= 15 × 4 × 1
= 60

Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children
Total number of ways = (6 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1)
= 8 choose 2
= (8! / (2! × 6!))
= 28

Step 4: Calculate the probability of each case
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways
= 90 / 28
= 15 / 28

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways
= 60 / 28
= 10 / 28

Since the probability of Case 1 (15/28) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (10/28), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
