To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children for each case and compare the two values.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the balls for Case 1.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Total number of possible ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the balls for Case 2.
In Case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1C1 = 1
Total number of possible ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Compare the two cases.
Since the total number of possible ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the total number of possible ways for Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
