To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children (A, B, and C) for each case and compare their relative probabilities.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among 3 children (A, B, and C).
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = 6! (permutations of 6 balls)

Step 2: Find the number of ways for Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2).
Number of ways for Case 1 = (2! × 2! × 2!) × (3! / 3!) = 90
Explanation: There are 2! ways to arrange the 2 balls for A, 2! ways for B, and 2! ways for C. The 3! accounts for the order of children (A, B, C).

Step 3: Find the number of ways for Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
Number of ways for Case 2 = (2! × 3! × 1!) × (3! / 3!) = 180
Explanation: There are 2! ways to arrange the 2 balls for A, 3! ways for B, and 1! way for C. The 3! accounts for the order of children (A, B, C).

Step 4: Calculate the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 6! = 90 / 720 = 0.125
Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways = 180 / 6! = 180 / 720 = 0.25

Since the probability of Case 2 (0.25) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (0.125), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
