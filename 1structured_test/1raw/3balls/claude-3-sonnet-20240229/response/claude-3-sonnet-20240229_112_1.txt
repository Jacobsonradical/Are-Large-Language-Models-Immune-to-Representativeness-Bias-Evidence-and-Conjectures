To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to obtain each case and then compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each.
The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To obtain this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into one group of 3 balls and two groups of 2 balls each.
The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × C(3, 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Since there are more ways to obtain case 2 (180 ways) than case 1 (90 ways), case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
