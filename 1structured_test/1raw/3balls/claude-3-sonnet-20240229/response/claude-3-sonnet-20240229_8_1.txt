To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, the distribution is fixed, and there is only one way to achieve this outcome.
Number of ways for case 1 = 1

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To calculate the number of ways for case 2, we can use the combination formula:
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (2 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 2 = 120

Since there are 120 ways to achieve case 2 and only 1 way to achieve case 1, case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2}
