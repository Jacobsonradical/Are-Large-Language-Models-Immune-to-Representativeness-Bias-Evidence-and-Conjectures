To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = 6! (permutations of 6 balls)
Total number of distributions = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of distributions for Case 1.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Number of distributions for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of distributions for Case 2.
In Case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1C1 = 1
Number of distributions for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of distributions for Case 1 and Case 2.
Number of distributions for Case 1 = 90
Number of distributions for Case 2 = 60

Since the number of distributions for Case 1 is greater than the number of distributions for Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
