To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
In this case, one child receives 3 balls, and the other two children receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this manner is given by:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to obtain Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
