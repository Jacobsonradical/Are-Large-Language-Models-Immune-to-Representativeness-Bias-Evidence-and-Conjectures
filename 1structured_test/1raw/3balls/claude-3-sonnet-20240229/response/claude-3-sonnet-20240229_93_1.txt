To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children for each case and compare their probabilities.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children = Combination(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = Combination(8, 2) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = Combination(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = Combination(4, 2) = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = Combination(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = Combination(4, 3) = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2.
Probability of Case 1 = 90 / 28 = 15 / 28
Probability of Case 2 = 60 / 28 = 10 / 28

Since the probability of Case 1 (15/28) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (10/28), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
