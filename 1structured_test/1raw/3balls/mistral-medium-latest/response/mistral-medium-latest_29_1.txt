To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

However, since the order of the groups does not matter (e.g., ABBCCC is the same as CCCAAB), we need to divide this by the factorial of the number of distinct groups, which is 3! = 6. Therefore, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways

Since the order of the groups does not matter, we need to divide this by the factorial of the number of distinct groups, which is 3! = 6. Therefore, there are 60 / 6 = 10 ways to distribute the balls for case 2.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls for case 2 (10 ways) than for case 1 (1 way), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
