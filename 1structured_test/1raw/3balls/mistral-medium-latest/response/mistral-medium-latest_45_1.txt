To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 2 balls for each child is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 / 2 = 45 ways (divided by 2 because the order of choosing the balls for each child doesn't matter)

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and B receive a specific number of balls more than C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Since there are 45 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
