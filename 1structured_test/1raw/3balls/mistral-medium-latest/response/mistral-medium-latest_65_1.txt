To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, since each child must receive exactly 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls (ABCABC).

For case 2, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A, which can be done in C(6,2) = 15 ways. Then, we need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B, which can be done in C(4,3) = 4 ways. Finally, child C will receive the remaining 1 ball. So there are a total of 15 x 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Since there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2 and only 1 way to distribute the balls in case 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
