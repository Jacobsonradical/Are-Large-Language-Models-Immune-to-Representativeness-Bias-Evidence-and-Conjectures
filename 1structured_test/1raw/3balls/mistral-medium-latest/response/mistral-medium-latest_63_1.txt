To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each receive 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since all the distributions are identical.

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of combinations for distributing the balls. There are C(6,2) ways to choose the 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1.
