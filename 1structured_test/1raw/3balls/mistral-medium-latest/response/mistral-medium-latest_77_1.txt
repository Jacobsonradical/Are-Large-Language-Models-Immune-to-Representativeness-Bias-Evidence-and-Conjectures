To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. Since the order of choosing the balls for each child doesn't matter, we multiply these combinations together:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (15) * (4) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Ways for case 1 > Ways for case 2

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
