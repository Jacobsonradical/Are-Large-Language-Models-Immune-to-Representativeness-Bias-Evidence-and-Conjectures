To answer this question, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each get 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the balls are given doesn't matter because we're only looking at the number of balls each child has at the end.

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since there are 6 balls and A is getting 2, B is getting 3, and C is getting 1, we can think of this as choosing 2 balls out of the 6 for child A, and the rest will go to B and C. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of balls (6 in this case) and k is the number of balls to choose (2 in this case).

C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = (6*5) / (2*1) = 15 ways

Therefore, there are 15 different ways to distribute the balls for case 2.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that case 2 has more possible outcomes than case 1. So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
