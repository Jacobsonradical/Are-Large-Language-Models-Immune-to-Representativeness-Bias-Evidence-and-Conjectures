To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the balls are given doesn't matter here because each child is receiving the same number of balls.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls respectively, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A and 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done using combinations (C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]).

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3)
                                     = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) * (4! / [3!(4-3)!])
                                     = (15) * (4)
                                     = 60

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
