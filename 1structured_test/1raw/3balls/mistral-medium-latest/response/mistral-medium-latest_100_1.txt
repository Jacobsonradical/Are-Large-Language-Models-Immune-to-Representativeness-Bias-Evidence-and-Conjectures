To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The arrangement would be something like (A, A, B, B, C, C).

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): We will calculate the number of distributions for this case. Since A and B have a fixed number of balls, we just need to find the number of ways to arrange these balls among the children. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of the multiset {A, A, B, B, B, C} which is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Multinomial coefficient = C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

Where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the frequencies of each type of item in the multiset. In this case, n = 6, r1 = 2 (for A), r2 = 3 (for B), and r3 = 1 (for C). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Multinomial coefficient = C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are 60 different ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the two cases:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
