To answer this question, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, since A, B, and C are getting an equal number of balls (2 each), we have only 1 way to distribute the balls like this.

For case 2, we have to choose 2 balls that will go to A, 3 balls that will go to B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 possible outcomes for case 2.

Since 15 > 1, it follows that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is {case: 2}.
