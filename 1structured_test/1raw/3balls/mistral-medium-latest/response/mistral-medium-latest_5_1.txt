To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we first need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child must receive exactly 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to count the number of ways to choose the 2 balls for child A, the 3 balls for child B, and the remaining ball for child C. This can be calculated using combinations:

- Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 = C(6,2) = 15
- Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 = C(4,3) = 4
- Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1 = C(1,1) = 1

Since these events are independent, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is the product of these values:

Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

- Case 1: 1 way
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {case: 2}
