To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child must receive exactly 2 balls.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): Since there are 6 balls, we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball for child C. We can use combinations to count the number of ways to do this. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for child A is C(6, 2), the number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B is C(4, 3), and there is only 1 way to choose the remaining ball for child C. Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × 1 = (15) × (4) × 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
