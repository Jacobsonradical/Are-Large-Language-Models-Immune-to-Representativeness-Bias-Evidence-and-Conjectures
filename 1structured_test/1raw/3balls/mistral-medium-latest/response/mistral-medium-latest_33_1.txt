To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order of distribution does not matter in this case.

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, we need to find the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. This can be calculated using combinations:

Ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
                 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!))
                 = 15 * 4 * 1
                 = 60

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2}
