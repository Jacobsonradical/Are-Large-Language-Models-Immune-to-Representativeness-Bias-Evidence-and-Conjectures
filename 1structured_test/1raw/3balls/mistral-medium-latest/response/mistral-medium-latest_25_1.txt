To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A, B, and C each get exactly 2 balls. There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case since all three children receive an equal number of balls. The order in which the balls are distributed does not matter here.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. There are C(6,2) ways to choose the 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. Since the order of choosing the balls does not matter, we need to account for this by dividing the product of combinations by the number of ways to arrange the balls for A and B (which is 2!).
So, the number of ways for case 2 is: C(6,2) \* C(4,3) / 2! = 15 \* 4 / 2 = 30.

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
