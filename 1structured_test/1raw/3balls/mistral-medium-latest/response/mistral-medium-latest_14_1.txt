To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, since A, B, and C each receive the same number of balls (2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child, which is (C(6,2))^3 = (15)^3.

For case 2, since A and B receive more balls than C (2 and 3 respectively), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C. This is given by C(6,2) \* C(4,3) \* C(1,1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60.

However, since there are 3 children, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the children in case 2 (e.g., A could have 2 balls, B could have 3 balls, and C could have 1 ball, or B could have 2 balls, A could have 3 balls, and C could have 1 ball, etc.). So the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 6 \* 60 = 360.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is greater than the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1, so there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
