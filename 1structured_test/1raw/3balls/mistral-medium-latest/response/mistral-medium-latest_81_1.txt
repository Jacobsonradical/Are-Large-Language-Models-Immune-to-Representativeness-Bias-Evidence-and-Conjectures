To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we first need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The arrangement would be (A, A, B, B, C, C).

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls respectively, and C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of combinations to distribute the balls. This can be done using the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r₁, r₂, ..., rₖ) = n! / (r₁! r₂! ... rₖ!)

where n is the total number of balls, and r₁, r₂, ..., rₖ are the number of balls received by each child.

In our case, n = 6, r₁ = 2 (for A), r₂ = 3 (for B), and r₃ = 1 (for C). So, the number of combinations for case 2 is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 30

Since there is only 1 possible outcome for case 1 and 30 possible outcomes for case 2, it is clear that case 2 will have more results in many rounds of the game.
