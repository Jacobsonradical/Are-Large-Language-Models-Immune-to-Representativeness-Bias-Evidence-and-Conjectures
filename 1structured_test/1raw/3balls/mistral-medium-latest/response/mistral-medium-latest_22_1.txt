To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since the balls are distinguishable, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for each child. Here, C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
                 = (15) * (6) * (1)
                 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and only 1 remaining ball for child C. Hence, the number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
                 = (15) * (4) * (1)
                 = 60

Since the number of ways for case 1 is greater than that of case 2, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
