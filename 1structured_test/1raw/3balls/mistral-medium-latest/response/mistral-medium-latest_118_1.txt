To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child is C(6,2) for the first pair, C(4,2) for the second pair, and the remaining 2 balls go to the third child. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6,2) × C(4,2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) × (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) = (15) × (6) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): In this case, we have to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6,2) × C(4,3) × C(1,1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) × (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) × (1! / (1!(1-1)!)) = (15) × (4) × (1) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
