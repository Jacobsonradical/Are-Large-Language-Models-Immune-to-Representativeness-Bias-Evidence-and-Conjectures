To answer this question, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

1. Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
C(6,2) \* C(4,2) = (6! / (2! \* 4!)) \* (4! / (2! \* 2!)) = 90
2. Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = (6! / (2! \* 4!)) \* (4! / (3! \* 1!)) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur than case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
