To determine which case occurs more frequently, we'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2 each). This is because the order in which the balls are distributed doesn't matter.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls among the children such that A and C have 1 unique ball each, and B has the remaining 3 balls. Since there are 6 balls, we need to choose 2 unique balls for A and 1 unique ball for C. This can be done using combinations:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) \* C(4, 1)

Using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial, we get:

Number of ways for case 2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) \* (4! / (1! * 3!))
                         = (720 / (2 * 24)) \* (24 / (1 * 6))
                         = 15 \* 4
                         = 60

So, there are 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, case 2 will happen more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
