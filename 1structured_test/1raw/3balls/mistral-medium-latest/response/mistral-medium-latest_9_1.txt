To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child gets an equal number of balls (2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. This can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6,2) \* C(4,3) \* C(1,1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (60 ways) than in case 1 (1 way), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
