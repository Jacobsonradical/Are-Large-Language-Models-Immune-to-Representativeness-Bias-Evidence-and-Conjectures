To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways.

However, since the order of the children does not matter, we must divide this by 3! (the number of ways to arrange the children) to get:

Ways for case 1 = 15 / 6 = 2.5 â‰ˆ 3 ways (since it's a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer).

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways.

Since the order of the children does not matter, we must divide this by 3! (the number of ways to arrange the children) to get:

Ways for case 2 = 60 / 6 = 10 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we find that:

Ways for case 1 > Ways for case 2
3 > 10

However, this comparison is incorrect due to rounding in case 1. The actual number of ways for case 1 is 2, which is less than the number of ways for case 2 (10).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
