To determine which case occurs more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probabilities of each case and compare them.

First, let's find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a stars-and-bars problem, and the solution is given by the combination:

C(n+k-1, k-1) = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 possible distributions

Now, let's find the number of ways to achieve each case:

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. Using the multiplication principle of counting, there are C(6,2) \* C(4,2) = 90 possible distributions for this case. However, since there are 3! = 6 permutations of (A,B,C) that lead to the same distribution, we have to divide by 6 to avoid overcounting. So, there are 90/6 = 15 possible distributions for case 1.

case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. Using the multiplication principle, there are C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = 40 possible distributions for this case. Again, since there are 3! = 6 permutations of (A,B,C) that lead to the same distribution, we have to divide by 6 to avoid overcounting. So, there are 40/6 â‰ˆ 6.67 possible distributions for case 2. Since it's impossible to have a fraction of a distribution, we round down to 6 possible distributions.

Comparing the number of possible distributions for each case:

case 1: 15 distributions
case 2: 6 distributions

{case: 1, 1 or 2}

There will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
