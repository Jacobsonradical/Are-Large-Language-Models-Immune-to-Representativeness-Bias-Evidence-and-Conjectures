To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. This is because all 3 children receiving the same number of balls means that each child must receive exactly 2 balls (since there are 6 balls in total).

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, we need to determine the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and which 1 ball goes to C. This can be calculated using combinations.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6,2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is C(4,3) = 4.
Since all the balls have been distributed, there is only 1 way to distribute the remaining ball to C.

Therefore, the total number of possible distributions for case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
