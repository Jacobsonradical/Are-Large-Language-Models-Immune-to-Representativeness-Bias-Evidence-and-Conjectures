To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the order in which the balls are given doesn't matter (as the balls are indistinguishable within each child's set). We use the stars-and-bars method to represent the distribution of balls: **|****|**, where '*' represents a ball and '|' represents a divider between children. Since all children receive an equal number of balls, there is only 1 arrangement.

For case 2, where one child receives 2 balls, another child receives 3 balls, and the last child receives 1 ball, we can use the stars-and-bars method again. There are 5 '*' (balls) and 2 '|' (dividers). The number of ways to place the dividers among the balls is C(5+2-1, 2) = C(6,2) = 15 ways. However, since the children A, B, and C are distinguishable, we need to account for the different combinations of which child receives 2, 3, or 1 balls. There are 3!/(2!1!) = 3 ways to distribute the balls in this case (ABC, ACB, or BAC). Therefore, there are 15 x 3 = 45 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we find that:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 45 ways

Since 45 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
