To determine which case occurs more frequently, we'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So the total number of ways for case 1 is:
ways\_case1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So the total number of ways for case 2 is:
ways\_case2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3)

Now let's calculate the combinations using the combination formula C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!):

ways\_case1 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
                = (15) * (6)
                = 90

ways\_case2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!))
                = (15) * (4)
                = 60

So there are more ways for case 1 to occur than case 2:

{case: 1, 1 or 2}
