To answer this question, let's calculate the number of possible distributions for each case:

1. Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child must receive exactly 2 balls.
2. Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): We need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls so that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, while B receives the remaining 3 balls. Since the 2 balls given to A and the 1 ball given to C are indistinguishable among themselves, this is equivalent to distributing 3 "markers" among the 6 balls, where the markers separate A's balls, B's balls, and C's ball. This can be done using combinations, where we choose 3 places out of the 6 possible places between and at the ends of the 6 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20 ways.

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2 (20 ways) than for case 1 (1 way), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {case: 2}
