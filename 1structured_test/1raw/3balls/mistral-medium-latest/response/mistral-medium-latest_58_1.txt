To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since the order of distribution does not matter, we are dividing the balls into 3 groups. We can use the multiset formula to find the number of ways to do this:

C(n+k-1, k-1) = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), again, the order of distribution does not matter. We have 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. Using the multiset formula, we get:

C(n+k-1, k-1) = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 ways

However, since the 2 balls for A and the 1 ball for C can be interchanged, there are 2! ways to arrange these indistinguishable groups. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

28 * 2! = 28 * 2 = 56 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more frequently than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
