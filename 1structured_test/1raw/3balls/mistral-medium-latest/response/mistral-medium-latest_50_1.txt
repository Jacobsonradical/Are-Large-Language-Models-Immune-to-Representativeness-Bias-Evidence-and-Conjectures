To answer this question, let's calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable.

For case 2, where A and B get 2 and 3 balls respectively, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, and the remaining 3 will go to B. The ball left goes to C. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 6 and k = 2, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15.

Since there are more possible outcomes for case 2 (15 ways) than for case 1 (1 way), we can expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
