To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls since all 3 children receive the same number. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child is C(6, 2) = 15, but since the order of choosing does not matter and all 3 children receive the same number of balls, we divide this by 3! (3 factorial) to account for the repetitions. So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = (C(6, 2))^3 / 3! = (15)^3 / 6 = 1125

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and C receives 1 ball, we first calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls to A and B. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6, 2) = 15, and the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is C(4, 3) = 4. Since the order of choosing for A and B does not matter, we divide this by 2! (2 factorial) to account for the repetitions. Then, we multiply this by the number of ways to distribute the remaining 1 ball to C. So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * 1 / 2! = 15 * 4 * 1 / 2 = 30 * 4 = 120

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 and case 2:

Ways for case 1 = 1125
Ways for case 2 = 120

Since 1125 > 120, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
