To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls for this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of combinations for distributing the balls. We can use the stars-and-bars method:

We have 6 balls and want to divide them into 3 groups (A, B, and C). To do this, we need to place 2 dividers among the balls. There are 7 spaces between and on the sides of the 6 balls where we can place the dividers. The number of ways to place 2 dividers in 7 spaces is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n = 7 and k = 2:

C(7, 2) = 7! / [2!(7-2)!] = 21

So there are 21 different ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 21 ways for case 2 to occur, in many rounds of the game, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1.

The answer is:
{case: 2}
