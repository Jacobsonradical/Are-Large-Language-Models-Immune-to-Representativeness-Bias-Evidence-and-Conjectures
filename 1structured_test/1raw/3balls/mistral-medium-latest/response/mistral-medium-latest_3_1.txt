To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we first need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 2 balls for each child is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

However, since the order of the children does not matter, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 children, which is 3! = 6. So, the number of ways for case 1 is 90 / 6 = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can calculate the number of ways by using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Again, since the order of the children does not matter, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 children, which is 3! = 6. So, the number of ways for case 2 is 60 / 6 = 10.

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 and case 2, we find that:

Number of ways for case 1 = 15
Number of ways for case 2 = 10

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur than case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
