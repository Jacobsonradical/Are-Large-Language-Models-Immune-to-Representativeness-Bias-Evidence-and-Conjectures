To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (15) * (4) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
