To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A, B, and C each get 2 balls.
Since the balls are distinguishable, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and no choice left for C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2)
                 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
                 = (15) * (6)
                 = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
                 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!))
                 = (15) * (4) * (1)
                 = 60

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
