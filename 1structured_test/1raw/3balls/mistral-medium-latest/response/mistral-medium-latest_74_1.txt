To determine which case will have more results, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the children receive the balls does not matter here.

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of combinations of balls for each child. Since the balls are distinguishable, we will use combinations with repetitions. The formula for this is:

C(n+r-1, r) = C(n+r-1, n-1)

Where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and C(n, r) is the number of combinations.

In our case, n = 6 (balls) and r = 2, 3, 1 for A, B, and C respectively.

For A: C(6+2-1, 2) = C(7, 2) = 21 combinations
For B: C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) = 56 combinations
For C: C(6+1-1, 1) = C(6, 1) = 6 combinations

Now, we multiply the combinations for each child to find the total number of ways case 2 can occur:

Total combinations for case 2 = 21 * 56 * 6 = 7,206

Comparing case 1 and case 2:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 7,206 ways

Since 7,206 > 1, there will be many more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2, 1 or 2}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
