To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90 / (2 \* 2 \* 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

However, since the distribution is fixed (2 balls for each child), there is only 1 way for this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 720 / (2 \* 6 \* 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

- Case 1: 1 way
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are 60 ways for case 2 to occur and only 1 way for case 1 to occur, case 2 will happen more frequently in many rounds of the game.
