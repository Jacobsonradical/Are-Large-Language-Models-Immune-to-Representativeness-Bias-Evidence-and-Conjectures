To answer this question, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in each case.

For case 1, since A, B, and C each get an equal number of balls (2), we can think of this as distributing the 6 balls into 3 indistinguishable groups of 2 balls each. This can be done in 1 way.

For case 2, since A and B get 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and C gets 1 ball, we can think of this as distributing the 6 balls into 3 distinguishable groups with sizes 2, 3, and 1. There are C(6-1, 2-1) = C(5,1) = 5 ways to choose which 2 of the 6 balls go to A, and there is 1 way to choose which 3 of the remaining 4 balls go to B. Therefore, there are 5 \* 1 = 5 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (5 ways) than in case 1 (1 way), we would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2, 1 or 2}

Answer: 2
