To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. The total number of combinations for case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The total number of combinations for case 2 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (15) * (4) = 60

Comparing the number of combinations for both cases:

Case 1: 90 combinations
Case 2: 60 combinations

Since there are more combinations for case 1, it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
