To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

There are a total of 6 balls, and they need to be distributed among 3 children. The total number of ways to distribute these balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r1, r2, r3) = n! / (r1! * r2! * r3!)

where n is the total number of balls, and r1, r2, and r3 are the number of balls received by each child.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, r1 = r2 = r3 = 2. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
= 720 / (2 * 2 * 2)
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, r1 = 2, r2 = 3, and r3 = 1. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
= 720 / (2 * 6 * 1)
= 60

Comparing the number of possible outcomes for each case, we find that case 1 has more possible outcomes (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
