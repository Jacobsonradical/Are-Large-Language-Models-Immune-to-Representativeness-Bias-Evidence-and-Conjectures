To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since the balls are distinguishable, there are C(6,2) ways to choose the 2 balls for each child. So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
                 = (15) * (6) * (1)
                 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:

ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
                 = (15) * (4) * (1)
                 = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
