To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Since there are 6 balls and each child must get 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So there are C(6,2) x C(4,3) = 15 x 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 than in Case 1, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
