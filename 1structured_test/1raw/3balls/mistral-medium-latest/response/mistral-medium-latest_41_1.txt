To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 15

However, since the order of the children does not matter, we have to divide this by the number of permutations of 3 children. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the children, but since switching any two children results in the same distribution, we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Therefore, the actual number of unique distributions for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = 15 / (3! / 2) = 15 / 3 = 5

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the same approach. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1 is given by:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 20

Again, since the order of the children matters in this case, we don't need to divide by anything, so the number of unique distributions for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = 20

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1:

Ways for case 1 = 5
Ways for case 2 = 20

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
