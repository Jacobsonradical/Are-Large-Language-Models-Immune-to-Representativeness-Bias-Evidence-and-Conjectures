To determine which case occurs more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The arrangement doesn't matter because we're only concerned with the distribution, not the order in which the balls are given.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. This can be done using combinations, which are given by the formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of objects, k is the number of objects to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for B (since 4 balls remain), and C(1, 1) way to choose 1 ball for C. The total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is the product of these combinations:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)

Calculating the combinations:

C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15
C(4, 3) = 4! / [3!(4-3)!] = 4
C(1, 1) = 1

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

Number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, case 2 will be more frequent in many rounds of the game.
