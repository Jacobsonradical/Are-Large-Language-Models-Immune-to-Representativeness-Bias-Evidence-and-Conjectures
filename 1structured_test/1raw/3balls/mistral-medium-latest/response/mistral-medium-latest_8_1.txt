To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child receives an equal number of balls (2), we only need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child out of the 6 distinguishable balls. This can be done using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child is C(6,2) = 15. Since there are three children, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15^3 = 3375.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, and B receives the remaining 3 balls. This can be done using multinomial coefficients. The number of ways for case 2 is given by (6!)/((2!)(3!)(1!)) = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we find that case 1 has 3375 possible outcomes, while case 2 has 60 possible outcomes. Since 3375 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
