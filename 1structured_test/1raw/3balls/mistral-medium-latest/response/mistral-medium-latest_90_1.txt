To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): Since each child must receive 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3)
               = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!))
               = (15) * (4)
               = 60

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
