To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2)
                 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
                 = 15 * 6
                 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3)
                 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!))
                 = 15 * 4
                 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Ways for case 1 > Ways for case 2

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
