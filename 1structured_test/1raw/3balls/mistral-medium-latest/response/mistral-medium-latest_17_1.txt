To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the probabilities.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90 / (2 × 2 × 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

Since there's only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case, the probability is 15/15 = 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, and B receives the remaining 3 balls. This can be done using combinations.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is C(6; 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 4 is C(4; 1) = 4.
Since B will receive the remaining 3 balls, we don't need to calculate for B.

Now, we need to account for the arrangement of these selections. Since A and C have fixed numbers of balls, the number of arrangements is simply the number of ways to arrange the chosen balls for A and C:

Arrangements = 2! × 1! = 2

Thus, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = Ways to choose balls for A × Ways to choose balls for C × Arrangements
                         = 15 × 4 × 2
                         = 120

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children without restrictions is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6+3-1; 3-1, 2, 1, 2) = C(8; 2, 2, 1, 2) = 8! / (2! × 2! × 1! × 2!) = 40,320 / (2 × 2 × 1 × 2) = 1,287 ways

Now, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:

Probability of case 1 = 15 / 1,287 ≈ 0.01165
Probability of case 2 = 120 / 1,287 ≈ 0.09316

Since the probability of case 2 is higher than that of case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
