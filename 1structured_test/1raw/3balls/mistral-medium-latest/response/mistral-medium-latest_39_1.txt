To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each get 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since all distributions resulting in 2 balls per child are identical.

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. This can be done using combinations. We have 6 balls, and we want to choose 2 of them to go to A, 3 to go to B, and the remaining 1 to go to C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)

Where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. Plugging in the values, we get:

C(6, 2) = 15
C(4, 3) = 4
C(1, 1) = 1

So the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is:

15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, it follows that case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
