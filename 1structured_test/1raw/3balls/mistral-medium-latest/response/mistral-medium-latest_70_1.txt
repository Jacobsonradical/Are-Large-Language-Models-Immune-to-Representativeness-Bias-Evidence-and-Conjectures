To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case and compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives exactly 2 balls. The multinomial coefficient formula can be used to confirm this:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

In this case, n = 6 balls and r1 = r2 = r3 = 2 balls:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 15 / 2 = 1 way

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the same multinomial coefficient formula:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 6 ways

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 1 possible distribution
- Case 2: 6 possible distributions

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2 than for case 1, in many rounds of the game, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1.
