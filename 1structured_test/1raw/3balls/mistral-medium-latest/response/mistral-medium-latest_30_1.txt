To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each child receives at least one ball, for both case 1 and case 2.

For case 1, since each child receives exactly 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls.

For case 2, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A, then give 3 balls to child B, and the remaining ball to child C. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient "6 choose 2", which is calculated as follows:

C(6,2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 ways to distribute the balls for case 2.

Since 15 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
