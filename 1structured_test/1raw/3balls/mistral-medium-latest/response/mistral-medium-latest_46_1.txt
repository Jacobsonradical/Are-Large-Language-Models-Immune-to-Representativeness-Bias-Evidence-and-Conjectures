To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways.

However, since the distribution is fixed in this case (2 balls for each child), there is only 1 way to achieve this result.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, while B receives the remaining 3 balls. This can be done using combinations:

- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6; 2) = 15 ways
- Choose 1 ball out of the remaining 4 for child C: C(4; 1) = 4 ways

Since the order of choosing the balls does not matter, we multiply the number of ways for A and C to get the total number of ways for case 2:

Total ways for case 2 = Ways for A * Ways for C = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of possible distributions for each case:

- Case 1: 1 way
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2, it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

The answer is: {case: 2}
