To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each get 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the balls are given does not matter here.

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, we will use combinations to determine the number of ways to choose the balls for each child.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 is C(4, 3) = 4.
The number of ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1 is C(1, 1) = 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls for case 2 (60 ways) than for case 1 (1 way), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
