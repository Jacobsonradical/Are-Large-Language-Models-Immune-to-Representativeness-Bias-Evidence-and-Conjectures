To determine which case will occur more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6, 2), where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. After choosing 2 balls for child A, there will be 4 balls left, and 2 balls each must be chosen for children B and C. The total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)

case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is still C(6, 2). After choosing 2 balls for child A, there will be 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B is C(4, 3), and then there will be only 1 ball left for child C. The total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)

Now let's calculate the values:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6
C(2, 2) = 2! / (2! * 0!) = 1
C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
C(1, 1) = 1! / (1! * 0!) = 1

For case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
For case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
