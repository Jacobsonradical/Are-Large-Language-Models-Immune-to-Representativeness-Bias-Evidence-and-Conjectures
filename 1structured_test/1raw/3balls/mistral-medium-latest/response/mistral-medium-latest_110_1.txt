To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The multinomial coefficient for this case is C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90 / (2 \* 2 \* 2) = 90 / 8 = 11.25. However, since the number of distributions must be a whole number, we take this as 11.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and which 1 ball goes to C. The multinomial coefficient for this case is C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 720 / (2 \* 6 \* 1) = 720 / 12 = 60.

Comparing the number of possible distributions for each case:

Case 1: 11 distributions
Case 2: 60 distributions

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {case: 2}
