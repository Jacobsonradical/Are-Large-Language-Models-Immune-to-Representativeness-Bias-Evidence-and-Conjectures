To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. So, the number of ways case 1 can occur is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) × C(4,2)
                 = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!))
                 = (15) × (6)
                 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. So, the number of ways case 2 can occur is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) × C(4,3)
                 = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (3! × 1!))
                 = (15) × (4)
                 = 60

Since the number of ways case 1 can occur (90) is greater than the number of ways case 2 can occur (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
