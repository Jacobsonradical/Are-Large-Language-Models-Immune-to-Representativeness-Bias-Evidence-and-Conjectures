To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 2 balls for each child among the 6 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 15

However, since the distribution is fixed with 2 balls for each child, there is only 1 valid arrangement in this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of possible distributions:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

So there are 60 different ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 ball.

Comparing the two cases:

Case 1: 1 possible distribution
Case 2: 60 possible distributions

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2, it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
