To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and 2 balls left for C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2)
                 = 15 * 6
                 = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and 1 ball left for C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3)
                 = 15 * 4
                 = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
