To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the children receive the balls matters (e.g., ABABC vs. ABACB). There are 6!/(2!2!2!) ways to arrange the balls for this case, but since all arrangements are equivalent due to the children all having the same number of balls, there is effectively only 1 way.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 balls each and C receives 1 ball, we need to consider the different ways these distributions can occur. First, we choose 2 balls for child C, which can be done in 6 choose 2 = 15 ways. Then, the remaining 4 balls must be distributed between A and B. Since both A and B receive an equal number of balls, the number of ways to distribute these balls is given by 4!/(2!2!) = 6. Therefore, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1 (90 vs. 1), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
