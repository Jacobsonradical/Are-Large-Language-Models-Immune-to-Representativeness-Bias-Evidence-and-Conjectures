To answer this question, we need to determine the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) \* C(4,2) = (15) \* (6) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = (15) \* (4) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Ways for case 1 > Ways for case 2

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
