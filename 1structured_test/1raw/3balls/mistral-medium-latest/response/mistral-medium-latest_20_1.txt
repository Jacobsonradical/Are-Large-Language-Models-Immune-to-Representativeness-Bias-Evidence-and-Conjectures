To determine which case occurs more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2 each). The 6 balls can be chosen from the 6 available balls in 1 way.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are more possibilities because the balls are distributed unevenly. We can choose 2 balls for child A in C(6,2) ways, 3 balls for child B in C(4,3) ways, and the remaining 1 ball for child C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(3,1)

Using the combination formula C(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where "!" denotes factorial, we find:

C(6,2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15
C(4,3) = 4! / [3!(4-3)!] = 4
C(3,1) = 3! / [1!(3-1)!] = 3

So, Ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 3 = 180

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case:

Ways for case 1 = 1
Ways for case 2 = 180

Since 180 > 1, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more frequently than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
