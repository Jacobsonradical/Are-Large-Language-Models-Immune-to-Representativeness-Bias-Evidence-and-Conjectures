To answer this question, we need to count the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the balls are given does not matter in this case.

For case 2, where A and B get 2 and 3 balls respectively, and C gets 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, we can use combinations to count the number of ways to choose the 2 balls for A, the 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

C(6,2) × C(4,3) × C(1,1) = (15) × (4) × (1) = 60

where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
