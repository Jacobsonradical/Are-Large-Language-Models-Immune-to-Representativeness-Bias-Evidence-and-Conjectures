To determine which case occurs more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, and B receives the remaining 3 balls. This is a combination problem: we're choosing 2 balls from the 6 balls to go to A and 1 ball from the remaining 4 balls to go to C. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) * C(4,1), where C(n,r) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
C(4,1) = 4! / (1! * 3!) = 4

So there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since there is only 1 way for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
