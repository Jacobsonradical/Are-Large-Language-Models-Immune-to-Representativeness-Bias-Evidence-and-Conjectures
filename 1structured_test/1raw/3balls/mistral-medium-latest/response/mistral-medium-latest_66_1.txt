To answer this question, we need to determine the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the balls are given does not matter in this case.

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, we have to take into account the different arrangements of balls for each child.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 can be calculated using combinations. We have 6 balls and we need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) \* C(1, 1) = (15) \* (4) \* (1) = 60

Therefore, there are 60 different ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there are more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
