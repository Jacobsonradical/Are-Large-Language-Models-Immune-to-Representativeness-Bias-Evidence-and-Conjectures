To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where each child receives exactly 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter in this case.

For case 2, where child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of combinations of balls for each child. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and only 1 way to choose the remaining 1 ball for child C. Using the combination formula C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), we find that there are C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for child A and C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose 3 balls for child B. Since the order doesn't matter, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we find that:

case 1: 1 way
case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {case: 2}
