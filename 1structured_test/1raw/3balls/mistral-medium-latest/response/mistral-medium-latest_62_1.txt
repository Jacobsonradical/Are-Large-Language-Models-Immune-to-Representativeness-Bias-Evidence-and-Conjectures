To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since all the balls are identical for each child.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and C receives 1 ball (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, we can use combinations to find the number of distributions.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6, 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4, 3) = 4.

Since child C will receive the remaining ball, we don't need to calculate for C. So the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is 15 Ã— 4 = 60.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more frequently than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more possible distributions for case 2.
