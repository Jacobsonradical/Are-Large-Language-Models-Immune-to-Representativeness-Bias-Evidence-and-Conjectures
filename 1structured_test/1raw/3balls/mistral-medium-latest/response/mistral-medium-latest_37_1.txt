To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

However, since the order of the children does not matter, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 children, which is 3! = 6. So, there are 15 / 6 = 2.5 ways for case 1, but since the number of ways must be a whole number, we round this down to 2 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways

Since the order of the children matters in this case, there are no additional adjustments to make, so there are 60 ways for case 2.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we find that:

Ways for case 1 = 2
Ways for case 2 = 60

Since 60 > 2, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
