To determine which case occurs more frequently, let's first calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case.

There are 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of distributions can be calculated using the stars and bars method. We have 6 "stars" (balls) and 2 "bars" (dividers) to separate the stars into 3 groups. The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is equivalent to the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 = 6, which is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of stars (6), and r is the number of children (3).

Total outcomes = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28 possible distributions

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case since each child receives exactly 2 balls.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To find the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. This can be done using the combination formula C(n, r) where n is the number of balls (6), and r is the number of balls given to each child.

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) * (1! / (1!(1-1)!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

However, since the order of the children doesn't matter, we need to divide the result by 3! (3 factorial) because there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 children.

Adjusted number of ways for case 2 = 60 / 3! = 10 possible distributions

Comparing the number of possible distributions for case 1 and case 2:

Case 1: 1 possible distribution
Case 2: 10 possible distributions

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
