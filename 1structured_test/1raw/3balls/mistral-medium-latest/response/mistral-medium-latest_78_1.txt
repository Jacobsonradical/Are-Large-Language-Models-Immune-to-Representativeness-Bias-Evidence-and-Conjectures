To answer this question, let's compute the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case:

1. Case 1: A gets 2, B gets 2, and C gets 2 balls.
Since the balls are distinguishable, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
C(6,2) \* C(4,2) = (6! / (2! \* 4!)) \* (4! / (2! \* 2!)) = (15) \* (6) = 90
2. Case 2: A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 ball.
Here, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = (6! / (2! \* 4!)) \* (4! / (3! \* 1!)) = (15) \* (4) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls for case 1 than case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1, 1 or 2}
