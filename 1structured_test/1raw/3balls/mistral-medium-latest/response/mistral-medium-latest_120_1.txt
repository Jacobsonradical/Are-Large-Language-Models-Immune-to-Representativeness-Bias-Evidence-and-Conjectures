To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each get 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since all 3 children get an equal number of balls. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, where A and B get 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and C gets 1 ball, we need to find the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A and which 3 balls go to B. This can be calculated using combinations:

C(6; 2) * C(4; 3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = 15 * 4 = 60

Now, let's compare the probabilities of both cases. Since the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 90 (which includes both case 1 and other possible distributions), the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways
         = 1 / 90
         ≈ 0.0111

The probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways
         = 60 / 90
         ≈ 0.6667

Comparing the probabilities, P(case 2) > P(case 1), so case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
