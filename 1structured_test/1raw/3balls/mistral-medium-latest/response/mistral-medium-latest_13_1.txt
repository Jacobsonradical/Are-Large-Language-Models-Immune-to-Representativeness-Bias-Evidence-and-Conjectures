To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to child A, which 3 balls go to child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) for choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, C(4,3) for choosing 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.

So the total number of ways for case 2 is: C(6,2) × C(4,3) = (15) × (4) = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there are more ways for case 2 (60 ways) than case 1 (1 way). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
