To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A, B, and C each get 2 balls.
Since the order of distribution does not matter in this case, we can use the multiset formula to find the number of ways to distribute the balls. The formula is given by:

C(n+r-1; r-1) = C(n+r-1; n)

where n is the number of distinguishable items (balls), r is the number of groups (children), and C(n; k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

Using this formula, we find that there are:

C(6+3-1; 3-1) = C(8; 2) ways to distribute the balls for case 1.

C(8; 2) = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 28 ways.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
In this case, we need to consider the number of distinguishable arrangements of the balls for each child. For A and C, there is only 1 way to distribute their respective balls. For B, there are C(3; 2) ways to choose 2 of the 3 slots for the remaining 2 balls (since the order does not matter). So there are:

C(3; 2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = 3 ways to distribute the balls for B.

Since the distribution for A, B, and C are independent, we multiply the number of ways for each child to find the total number of ways for case 2:

Total ways for case 2 = Ways for A * Ways for B * Ways for C = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3 ways.

Comparing the results, we find that there are more ways for case 1 to occur than case 2:

case: 1

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
