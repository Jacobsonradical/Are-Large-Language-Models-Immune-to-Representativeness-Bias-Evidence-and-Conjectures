To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we first need to find the number of ways each case can occur.

Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Now let's find the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 1 (since there's only 1 way to distribute the balls as specified)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways for Case 2 = C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for both cases:

Number of ways for Case 1 = 1
Number of ways for Case 2 = 60

Since Case 2 has more possible distributions (60) than Case 1 (1), it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
