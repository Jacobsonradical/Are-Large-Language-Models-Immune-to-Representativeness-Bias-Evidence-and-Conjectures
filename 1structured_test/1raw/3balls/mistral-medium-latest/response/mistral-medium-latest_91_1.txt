To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 2 balls for each child is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90 / (2 \* 2 \* 2) = 90 / 8 = 11.25

However, since the arrangement is fixed, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to child A, which 3 balls go to child B, and which 1 ball goes to child C. This can be calculated using combinations:

Ways to choose 2 balls for A = C(6; 2) = 6! / (2! \* 4!) = 15
Ways to choose 3 balls for B = C(6; 3) = 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 20
Ways to choose 1 ball for C = C(6; 1) = 6! / (1! \* 5!) = 6

Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose balls for each child to find the total number of possible distributions for case 2:

Total ways for case 2 = Ways to choose 2 balls for A \* Ways to choose 3 balls for B \* Ways to choose 1 ball for C
                      = 15 \* 20 \* 6
                      = 1800

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2 (1800) than for case 1 (1), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
