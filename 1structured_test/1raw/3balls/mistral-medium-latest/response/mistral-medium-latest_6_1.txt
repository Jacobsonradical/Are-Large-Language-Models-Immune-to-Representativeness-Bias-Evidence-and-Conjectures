To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1, where each child receives exactly 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls respectively, and C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls from the 6 balls for child A, and then the number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be calculated using combinations.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for child A is C(6,2) = 6!/(2!(6-2)!) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,3) = 4!/(3!(4-3)!) = 4.

Therefore, the total number of possible distributions for case 2 is 15 x 4 = 60.

Since there is only 1 possible distribution for case 1 and 60 possible distributions for case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
