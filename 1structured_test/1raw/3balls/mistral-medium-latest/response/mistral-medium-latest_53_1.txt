To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls for each case.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient, which is given by:

(6!)/(2!2!2!) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is also a multinomial coefficient, which is given by:

(6!)/(2!3!1!) = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
