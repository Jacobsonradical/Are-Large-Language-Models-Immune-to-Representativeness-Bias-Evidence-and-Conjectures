To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls for this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A and C receive 2 and 1 ball, respectively, while B receives the remaining 3 balls. This is a combination problem, and the number of ways can be calculated using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of balls and k is the number of balls for one child. Here, we have C(6, 2) ways to give 2 balls to A, C(4, 2) ways to give 2 balls to C (after giving 2 to A), and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to B. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) = 90.

Comparing the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 90 ways

Since there are 90 ways for case 2 to occur compared to only 1 way for case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

The answer is:
{case: 2}
