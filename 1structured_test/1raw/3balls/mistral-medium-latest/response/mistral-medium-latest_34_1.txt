To solve this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6,2) x C(4,2) = 15 x 6 = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. Similarly, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

C(6,2) x C(4,3) = 15 x 4 = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
