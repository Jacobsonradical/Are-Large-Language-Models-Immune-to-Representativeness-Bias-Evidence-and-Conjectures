To determine which case occurs more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur. Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, we'll use combinations to count the possibilities.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)

Now, calculate the combinations:
C(n, r) = n! / [r! * (n - r)!]

For case 1:
C(6, 2) = 15
C(4, 2) = 6
C(2, 2) = 1
Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2:
C(6, 2) = 15
C(4, 3) = 4
C(1, 1) = 1
Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the total ways for both cases:
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
