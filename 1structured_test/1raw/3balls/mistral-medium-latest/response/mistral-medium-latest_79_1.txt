To answer this question, let's calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

First, we need to find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a stars and bars problem, and the solution is given by the combination:

C(n+k-1, k-1)

where n is the number of balls, and k is the number of children.

Total distributions = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28

Now, let's find the number of distributions for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). Since there is only one way to distribute 2 balls to each child, there is only 1 distribution for case 1.

Next, let's find the number of distributions for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). We can use the multinomial coefficient to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

Multinomial(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of balls, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of balls given to each child.

For case 2, we have:

Multinomial(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20

Since there are 20 distributions for case 2 and only 1 distribution for case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

The answer is:
{case: 2}
