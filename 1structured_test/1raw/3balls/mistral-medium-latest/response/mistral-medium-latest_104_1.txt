To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and which 1 ball goes to C. This can be done using combinations:

C(6; 2) * C(4; 3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (15) * (4) = 60 ways

Since there are 15 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
