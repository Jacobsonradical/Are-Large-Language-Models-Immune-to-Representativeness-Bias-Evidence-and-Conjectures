To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to count the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Since there are 6 balls, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6, 2), where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. After distributing 2 balls to A, there are 4 balls left, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is C(4, 2), and finally, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for C is C(2, 2). The total number of ways for case 1 is:

Ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6, 2), the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is C(6, 3), and the number of ways to choose 1 ball for C is C(3, 1) (since after distributing 2 balls to A and 3 balls to B, there are 3 balls left). The total number of ways for case 2 is:

Ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(3, 1)

Now let's calculate the number of ways for each case.

Ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (15) * (6) * (1) = 90

Ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(3, 1) = (15) * (20) * (3) = 900

Comparing the number of ways, we find that:

Ways for case 2 > Ways for case 1

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
