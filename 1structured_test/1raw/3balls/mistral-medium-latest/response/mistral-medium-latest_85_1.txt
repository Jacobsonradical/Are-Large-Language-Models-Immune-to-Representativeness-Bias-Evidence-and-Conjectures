To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90 / (2 × 2 × 2) = 15

However, since the order of the children doesn't matter, we need to divide this by the number of permutations of 3 children, which is 3! = 6. So, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 720 / (2 × 6 × 1) = 60

Since the order of the children matters in this case, there are 60 distinct ways to distribute the balls as described in case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1:

{case: 2}
