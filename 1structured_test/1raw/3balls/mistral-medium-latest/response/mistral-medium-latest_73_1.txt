To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a stars and bars problem, and the solution is given by the combination formula: C(n+k-1, k-1), where n is the number of balls and k is the number of children. Here, n = 6 and k = 3, so the total number of possible outcomes is C(8, 2) = 28.

Next, let's determine the number of outcomes that correspond to case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner, so there are 1 possible outcome for case 1.

Now, let's determine the number of outcomes that correspond to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). We can use the multinomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner. The multinomial coefficient is given by the formula: n! / (n1! \* n2! \* ... \* nk!), where n is the total number of balls and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of balls given to each child. Here, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, and n3 = 1, so the number of possible outcomes for case 2 is 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 20.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2, 1 or 2}

Explanation:

There are 28 possible outcomes when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. There is only 1 outcome that corresponds to case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and 20 outcomes that correspond to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
