To answer this question, let's first calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

1. Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child receives exactly 2 balls.
2. Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): There are C(6,2) ways to choose the 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. So, the total number of distributions for case 2 is C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Since there are more distributions for case 2 (60) than case 1 (1), over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

{case: 2}
