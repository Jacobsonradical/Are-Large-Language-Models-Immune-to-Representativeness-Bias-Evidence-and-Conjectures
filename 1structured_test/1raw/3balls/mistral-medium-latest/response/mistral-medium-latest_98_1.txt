To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child must receive exactly 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use combinations to find the number of ways to distribute the balls. We have 3 choices for the child who receives 3 balls (A, B, or C) and 2 choices for the child who receives 1 ball (after choosing the child with 3 balls). However, since A getting 2 balls is common in both choices, we need to account for this by dividing by 2. The total number of ways for case 2 is 3 * 2 / 2 = 3 ways.

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game because there are more possible distributions for case 2 than case 1.
