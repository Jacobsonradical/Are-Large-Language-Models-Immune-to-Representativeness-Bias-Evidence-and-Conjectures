To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case and compare them.

There are a total of 6 balls, and we want to distribute them among 3 children. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the stars and bars method. We have 6 "stars" representing the balls and 2 "bars" separating the children. The total number of arrangements is equivalent to choosing 2 positions from the 8 possible positions (6 stars + 2 bars) to place the bars, which is a combination problem:

Total arrangements = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28 combinations

Now, let's calculate the number of arrangements for each case:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. The total number of arrangements for case 1 is:

Arrangements for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = 90 / 4 = 21 combinations

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. The total number of arrangements for case 2 is:

Arrangements for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = 90 / 4 = 20 combinations

However, since the order of children matters when placing the bars (e.g., AB|C and AC|B represent different cases), we need to divide the number of arrangements for case 2 by 3! (the number of permutations of the children) to avoid overcounting:

Unique arrangements for case 2 = 20 / 3! = 10 / 3 â‰ˆ 3.33 combinations (rounded down to 3, as it cannot be a fraction)

Comparing the number of arrangements for each case:
Case 1: 21 combinations
Case 2: 3 combinations

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
