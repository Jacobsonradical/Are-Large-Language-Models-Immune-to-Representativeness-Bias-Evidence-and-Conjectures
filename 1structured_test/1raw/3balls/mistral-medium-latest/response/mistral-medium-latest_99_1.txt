To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), since each child must receive exactly 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls. We can think of this as arranging 2 "dividers" among the 6 balls to separate them into groups of 2 for each child. Since there are 5 spaces between and on the ends of the 6 balls where we can place the dividers, there is only 1 way to choose 2 of these spaces (C(5,2) = 10 possible choices, but since the order of the children doesn't matter, we divide by 3! = 6, so there is only 1 unique way to distribute the balls in case 1).

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls to go to child A, 3 balls to go to child B, and 1 ball to go to child C. This can be done in C(6,2) ways for child A, C(4,3) ways for child B (since 2 balls have already been chosen), and C(1,1) way for child C. The total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is therefore C(6,2) \* C(4,3) \* C(1,1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60.

Since there are 60 possible ways for case 2 to occur and only 1 way for case 1 to occur, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
