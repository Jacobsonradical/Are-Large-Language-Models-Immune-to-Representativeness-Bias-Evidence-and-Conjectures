To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The ordering of the balls is important, so we have 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 possible permutations, but since all three children receive the same number of balls, we divide by 3! to account for the repeated permutations. This leaves us with 90/6 = 15 unique distributions.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 balls each and C receives 1 ball, we need to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 2 go to B, and which 1 goes to C. There are C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for A, and for each of those choices, there are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose 2 balls for B. Since there is only one choice left for C, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways to distribute the balls in this case. However, since the balls are distinguishable and we have counted some permutations multiple times, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the balls within each child's group. There are 2! permutations of A's balls, 2! permutations of B's balls, and 1! permutations of C's ball, so we need to divide by 2!2!1! = 4. This leaves us with 90/4 = 22.5 unique distributions, but since there cannot be half a distribution, we round down to 22.

Since there are more unique distributions for case 1 (15) than for case 2 (22), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
