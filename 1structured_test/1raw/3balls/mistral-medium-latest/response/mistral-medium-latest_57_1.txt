To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare their probabilities.

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children, so we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children for each case.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
We have to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 will go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the product of combinations:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball will go to child C:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (15) * (4) = 60

Now let's calculate the total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x + y + z = 6, which is given by the combinatorial formula C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of items (balls) and r is the number of groups (children):

Total distributions = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8,2) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28

The probabilities for case 1 and case 2 are respectively:

P(case 1) = 90 / 28 = 3.2143
P(case 2) = 60 / 28 â‰ˆ 2.1429

Since P(case 1) > P(case 2), there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
