To determine which case occurs more frequently, we'll calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child receives exactly 2 balls.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, let's choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in C(6,2) ways, where C(n,k) denotes the binomial coefficient "n choose k". 
C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15 ways.

Now, there are 4 balls left. We'll choose 3 of them for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways. C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4 ways.

The remaining ball will go to child C. Thus, for case 2, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 possible distributions.

Comparing the number of distributions for each case:

Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls according to case 2, it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
