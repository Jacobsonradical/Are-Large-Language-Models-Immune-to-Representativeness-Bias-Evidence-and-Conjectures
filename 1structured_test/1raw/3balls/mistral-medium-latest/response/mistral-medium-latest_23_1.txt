To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls for each case.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there is only one way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable.

For case 2, where A and B get 2 and 3 balls respectively, and C gets 1 ball, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last ball goes to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) = (6! / [2!4!]) \* (4! / [3!1!])
= (15) \* (4)
= 60

Since there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in case 1 and 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 or 2}

Answer: {case: 2}
