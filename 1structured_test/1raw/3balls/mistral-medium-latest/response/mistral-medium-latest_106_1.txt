To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable. The order in which the children receive the balls does not matter here because each child receives the same number of balls.

For case 2, where A and B receive 2 and 3 balls respectively, and C receives 1 ball, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since the balls are distinguishable, we will use combinations to determine the number of ways to choose the balls for each child.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is C(6,2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 is C(4,3) = 4.
The remaining 1 ball will go to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case:
Case 1: 1 way
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
