To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

However, since the order of the children doesn't matter, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the children, which is 3! = 6.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15/6 = 2.5, but since it's not possible to have half a combination, we round it down to 2 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60 ways

Since the order of the children matters in this case, we don't need to divide by any factorial of the number of children.

Comparing the results, we see that case 2 has 60 ways to occur, while case 1 only has 2 ways. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
