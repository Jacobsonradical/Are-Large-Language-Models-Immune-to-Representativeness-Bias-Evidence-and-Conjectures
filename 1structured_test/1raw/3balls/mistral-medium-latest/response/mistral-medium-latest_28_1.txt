To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So there are C(6,2) × C(4,2) ways for case 1.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A and C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B. Then, the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So there are C(6,2) × C(4,3) ways for case 2.

Now let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

For case 1: C(6,2) × C(4,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) × (4! / (2! * 2!)) = (15) × (6) = 90 ways.

For case 2: C(6,2) × C(4,3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) × (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (15) × (4) = 60 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
