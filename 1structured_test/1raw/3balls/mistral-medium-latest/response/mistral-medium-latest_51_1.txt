To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we first need to calculate the probabilities of each case occurring in a single round.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls such that each child receives 2 balls. The probability of this happening is:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) / (6 choose 6)
= (15) * (6) * (1) / 1
= 90 / 1
= 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are different ways to distribute the balls, depending on which child gets 3 balls and which child gets 1. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the children in terms of who gets 2, 3, or 1 ball. For each arrangement, we can calculate the probability:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1)
= (15) * (4) * (1)
= 60

Since there are 6 arrangements, the total probability for case 2 is 6 * 60 = 360.

Comparing the probabilities, we find that case 2 is more likely to occur than case 1:

Probability of case 1 = 90/1 = 90
Probability of case 2 = 360/1 = 360

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
