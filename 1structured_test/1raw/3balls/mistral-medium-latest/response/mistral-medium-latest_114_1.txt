To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children for each case.

For case 1, since A, B, and C each get an equal number of balls (2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner.

For case 2, we need to find the number of combinations of distributing the balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1. We can use the "stars and bars" method.

We have 6 balls (stars) and need to divide them into 3 groups (A, B, and C). To do this, we need to place 2 dividers (bars) between the stars. The number of ways to place these bars is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 places out of 8 total places (6 stars and 2 bars), which is a combination problem: C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n = 8 and k = 2.

So, the number of combinations for case 2 is C(8, 2) = 8! / [2!(8-2)!] = 28 ways.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls according to case 2 than case 1, the answer is:
{case: 2}
