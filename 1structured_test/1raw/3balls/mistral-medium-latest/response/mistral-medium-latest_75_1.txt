To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6,2) × C(4,2) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) = (15) × (6) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6,2) × C(4,3) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (3! × 1!)) = (15) × (4) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we find that:

Ways for case 1 > Ways for case 2
(90 > 60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
