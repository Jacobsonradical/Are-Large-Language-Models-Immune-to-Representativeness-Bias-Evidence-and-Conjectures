To solve this problem, we need to figure out the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2 each). The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 15 / 2 = 7.5, which is not a valid outcome as it should be a whole number. However, since the balls are distinguishable, there is only 1 way to distribute them in this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and which 1 ball goes to C. This can be done using combinations: C(6; 2) for A, C(4; 3) for B (since 2 balls are already chosen for A), and C(1; 1) for C (no choice here). The total number of ways for case 2 is the product of these combinations: C(6; 2) * C(4; 3) * C(1; 1) = (15) * (4) * (1) = 60.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (60) than case 1 (1), the answer is:
{case: 2}
