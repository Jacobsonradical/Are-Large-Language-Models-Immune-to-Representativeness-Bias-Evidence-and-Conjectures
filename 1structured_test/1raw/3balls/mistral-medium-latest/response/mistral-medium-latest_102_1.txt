To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, the number of ways to distribute them in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is: {case: 1}
