To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of distinguishable ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 11.25

However, since the number of distributions must be a whole number, we take the largest integer less than or equal to this value, which is 11.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. The multinomial coefficient for this case is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60

Comparing the number of possible distributions for each case:

Case 1: 11 distributions
Case 2: 60 distributions

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
