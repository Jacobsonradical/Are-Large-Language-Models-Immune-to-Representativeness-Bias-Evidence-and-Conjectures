To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So there are:

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2)
                        = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
                        = (15) * (6)
                        = 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So there are:

Ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3)
                        = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!))
                        = (15) * (4)
                        = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
