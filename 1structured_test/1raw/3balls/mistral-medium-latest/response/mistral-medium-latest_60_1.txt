To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, since each child must receive exactly 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.

For case 2, we will use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the balls. We have 6 balls (represented by stars: ***) and we need to divide them into 3 groups (A, B, and C) using 2 dividers (||). For example, one possible distribution could be represented as **|*||***, which corresponds to A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball. The total number of distributions in this case is equivalent to the number of ways to place 2 dividers among 8 positions (6 stars and 2 dividers), which is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+k-1, k-1) = C(8,2) = 28.

Therefore, there are more results of case 2 (28 ways) than case 1 (1 way) in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2, 1 or 2}
