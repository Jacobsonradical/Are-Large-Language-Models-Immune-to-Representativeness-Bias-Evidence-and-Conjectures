To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, there are:

C(6,2) × C(4,2) = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) × (4! / [2!(4-2)!])
= (15) × (6)
= 90 ways

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, there are:

C(6,2) × C(4,3) = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) × (4! / [3!(4-3)!])
= (15) × (4)
= 60 ways

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
