To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since the balls are distinguishable.

For case 2, where A and B get 2 and 3 balls respectively, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A and 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in C(6,2) ways for choosing A's balls and C(4,3) ways for choosing B's balls. So the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
