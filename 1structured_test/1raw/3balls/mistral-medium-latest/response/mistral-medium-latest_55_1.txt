To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we first need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2). The order in which the balls are distributed does not matter here.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since there are 6 balls and A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1, we can use combinations to find the number of possible distributions. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.

First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6, 2) = 15 ways.
Then, we have 4 balls left, and we choose 3 for child B: C(4, 3) = 4 ways.
Since child C gets the remaining ball, there is only 1 way to do this.

The total number of possible distributions for case 2 is the product of these individual choices: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Since case 2 has 60 possible outcomes and case 1 has only 1 possible outcome, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
