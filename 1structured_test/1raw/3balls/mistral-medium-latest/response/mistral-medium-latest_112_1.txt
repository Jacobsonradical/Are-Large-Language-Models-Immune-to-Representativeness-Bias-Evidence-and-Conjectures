To answer this question, let's first calculate the number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children. This is a combinatorics problem, and the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 6! / (2^2 * 3!) = 15

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

For case 1, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls (2 balls to each child).

For case 2, there are (6! / (2! * 3!)) = 20 ways to distribute the balls (2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C). However, since there are 3 choices for which child gets 3 balls and the other two get 2 and 1, we need to divide this by 3. So, there are 20/3 = 6.67 â‰ˆ 6 ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (since the number of ways must be a whole number, let's say there are 6 ways).

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 (6 ways) than case 1 (1 way), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
