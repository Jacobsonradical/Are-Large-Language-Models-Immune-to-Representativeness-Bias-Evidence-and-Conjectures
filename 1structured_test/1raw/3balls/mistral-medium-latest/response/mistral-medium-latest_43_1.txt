To solve this problem, let's count the possible outcomes for each case:

1. Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner since each child receives a fixed number of balls (2).
2. Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): There are different ways to distribute the balls in this manner. We need to find the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls from 6 for child A, 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C. This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) for child A and C(4,3) for child B. So there are C(6,2) \* C(4,3) ways = (15) \* (4) = 60 ways.

Since there are more possible outcomes for case 2 (60 ways) than case 1 (1 way), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

The answer is:
{case: 2}
