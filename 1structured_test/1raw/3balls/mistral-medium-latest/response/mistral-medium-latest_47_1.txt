To solve this problem, we will count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, there are C(6,2) \* C(4,2) ways to distribute the balls in this case.

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! \* 4!) = 15
C(4,2) = 4! / (2! \* 2!) = 6

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 \* 6 = 90.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, there are C(6,2) \* C(4,3) ways to distribute the balls in this case.

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! \* 4!) = 15
C(4,3) = 4! / (3! \* 1!) = 4

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 \* 4 = 60.

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
