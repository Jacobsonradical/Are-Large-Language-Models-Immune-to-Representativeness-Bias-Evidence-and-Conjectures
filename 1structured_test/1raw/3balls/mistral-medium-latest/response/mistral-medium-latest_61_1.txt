To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 ways

However, since the order of the children doesn't matter (ABC is the same as BCA), we divide this by 3! to get the number of unique distributions: 15 / 6 = 2.5 â‰ˆ 3 ways (rounding down to 3, as there must be a whole number of possibilities).

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to distribute the balls:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways

Since the order of the children doesn't matter, we divide this by 3! to get the number of unique distributions: 60 / 6 = 10 ways.

Comparing the two cases, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has more possible distributions (10 ways) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) (3 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
