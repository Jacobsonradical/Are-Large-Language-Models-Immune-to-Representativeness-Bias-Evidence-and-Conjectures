To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls since each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to arrange 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90 / (2 \* 2 \* 2) = 90 / 8 = 15 / 1 = 15 ways. However, since the order of the children does not matter, we divide this by the number of permutations of 3 children: 3! = 6. So, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can use the multinomial coefficient again to find the number of ways to arrange the balls: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 720 / (2 \* 6 \* 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways. Since the order of the children matters in this case, there are no additional adjustments needed. Therefore, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls for case 2.

Comparing the two cases, it's clear that:

{case: 2}

Case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1, as there are 60 possible distributions for case 2 compared to only 1 possible distribution for case 1.
