To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

First, let's find the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a stars and bars problem, where we use 2 "bars" to separate the balls between the children. So, there are 8 spaces (6 for the balls and 2 for the bars), and we choose 2 of them to be the bars. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of spaces and k is the number of bars.

Total distributions = C(8, 2) = 8! / [2!(8-2)!] = 28 combinations

Now, let's find the number of ways for each case:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): We have 3 groups of identical items (2 balls each), so we need to divide the total number of distributions for this case by the product of factorials of the number of items in each group (2! * 2! * 2!) to avoid overcounting. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2, 2) = 6! / [2!2!2!(6-2-2-2)!] = 15. But since there are 3! ways to arrange the children, and the arrangement does not matter in this case, we divide 15 by 3! to get 15 / 6 = 2.5. However, since the number of distributions must be a whole number, we round it down to 2.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): We have 3 groups of items (2 balls, 3 balls, and 1 ball), so we need to divide the total number of distributions for this case by the product of factorials of the number of items in each group (2! * 3! * 1!) to avoid overcounting. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / [2!3!1!(6-2-3-1)!] = 20. But since the arrangement does not matter in this case, we do not need to divide by any additional factorials.

Comparing the two cases, we see that:

Case 1: 2 distributions
Case 2: 20 distributions

Since there are more distributions for Case 2, it will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Final answer: {case: 2}
