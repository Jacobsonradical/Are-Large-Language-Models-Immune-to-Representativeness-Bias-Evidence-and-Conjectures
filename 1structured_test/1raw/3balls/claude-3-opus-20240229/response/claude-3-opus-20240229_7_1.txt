Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a simple permutation problem. The answer is:

   6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720

2) Now, for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to calculate how many ways there are to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This is a multinomial coefficient problem:

   (6 choose (2,2,2)) = 6! / (2! x 2! x 2!) = 90

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), similarly:

   (6 choose (2,3,1)) = 6! / (2! x 3! x 1!) = 60

4) So, out of the total 720 possible distributions, 90 will result in case 1 and 60 will result in case 2.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
