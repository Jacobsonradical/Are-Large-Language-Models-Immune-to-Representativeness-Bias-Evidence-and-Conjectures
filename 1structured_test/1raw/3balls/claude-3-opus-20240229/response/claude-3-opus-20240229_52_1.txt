To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls for A, then $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls for A, then $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
