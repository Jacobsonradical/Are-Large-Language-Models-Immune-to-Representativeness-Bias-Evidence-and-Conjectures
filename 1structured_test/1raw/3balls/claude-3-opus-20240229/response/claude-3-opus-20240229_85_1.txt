Let's reason this out step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed for each case.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient:

   $\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have three different possibilities: (A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, C:3, B:1), and (B:2, A:3, C:1). For each of these, we can again use the multinomial coefficient:

   $\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

   Since there are three such possibilities, the total number of ways for case 2 is $60 \times 3 = 180$.

4) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more often than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

Answer:
{case: 2}
