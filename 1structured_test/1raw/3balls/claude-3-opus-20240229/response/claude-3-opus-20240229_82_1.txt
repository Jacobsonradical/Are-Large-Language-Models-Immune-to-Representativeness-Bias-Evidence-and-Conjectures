To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can think of this as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.

- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$ = 15
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{2}$ = 6
- The remaining 2 balls go to C

The total number of ways for case 1 is 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We can think of this as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.

- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$ = 15
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C

The total number of ways for case 2 is 15 × 4 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) compared to case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
