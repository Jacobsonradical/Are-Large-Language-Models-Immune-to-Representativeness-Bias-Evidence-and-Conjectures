Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the number of ways case 1 can happen. 
   - There are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for A.
   - After that, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for B.
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   
   So, the total number of ways for case 1 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$.

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways case 2 can happen.
   - Again, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for A.
   - After that, there are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose 3 balls for B.
   - The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
   
   So, the total number of ways for case 2 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$.

3) Since 90 > 60, case 1 will happen more often than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, my answer is:

{case: 1}
