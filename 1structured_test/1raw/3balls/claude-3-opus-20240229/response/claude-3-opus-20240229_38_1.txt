Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.

Number of ways = $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2!} = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.

Number of ways = $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1!} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
