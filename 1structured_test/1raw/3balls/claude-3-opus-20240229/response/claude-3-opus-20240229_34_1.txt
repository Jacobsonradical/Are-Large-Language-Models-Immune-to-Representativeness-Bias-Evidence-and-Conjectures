Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children. This is a simple permutation problem. The answer is 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.

2) Now, for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to calculate how many ways we can select 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
   - We can select 2 balls for A in 6C2 = 15 ways.
   - After that, we can select 2 balls for B in 4C2 = 6 ways.
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C in only 1 way.
   - So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), a similar calculation:
   - We can select 2 balls for A in 6C2 = 15 ways.
   - After that, we can select 3 balls for B in 4C3 = 4 ways.
   - The remaining 1 ball goes to C in only 1 way.
   - So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

4) Comparing the results, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls according to case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
