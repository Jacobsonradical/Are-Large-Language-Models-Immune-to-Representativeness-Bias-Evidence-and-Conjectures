To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.

Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.

Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
