To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children:
6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6
Number of ways to give the remaining 2 balls to C: 2C2 = 1
Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C3 = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
Number of ways to give the remaining 1 ball to C: 1C1 = 1
Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and only 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
