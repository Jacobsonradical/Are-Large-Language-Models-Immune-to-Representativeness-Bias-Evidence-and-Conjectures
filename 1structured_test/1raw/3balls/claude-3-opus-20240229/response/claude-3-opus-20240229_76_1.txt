Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a stars and bars problem. The formula is:

   $\dbinom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ where $n$ is the number of balls and $k$ is the number of children.

   In this case, $n=6$ and $k=3$. So the total number of ways is:

   $\dbinom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \dbinom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} = 28$

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a multinomial coefficient problem. The formula is:

   $\dbinom{n}{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot ... \cdot n_k!}$ where $n$ is the total number of balls and $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ are the number of balls each child gets.

   In this case, $n=6$, $n_1=2$, $n_2=2$, and $n_3=2$. So the number of ways for case 1 is:

   $\dbinom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = 90$

3) Similarly, for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is:

   $\dbinom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 6} = 60$

4) Therefore, out of the total 28 ways to distribute the balls, 90 correspond to case 1 and 60 correspond to case 2.

5) Since 90 > 60, case 1 will occur more often than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Answer:
{case: 1}
