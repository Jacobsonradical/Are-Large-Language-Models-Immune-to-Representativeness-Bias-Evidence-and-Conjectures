To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Let's start with case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 each:

$\dbinom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

Now for case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Again, using the multinomial coefficient formula:

$\dbinom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur and only 60 ways for case 2 to occur, case 1 will happen more often in many rounds of the game.
