Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   $\dbinom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

   where $n$ is the number of balls and $k$ is the number of children.

2) In this case, $n=6$ and $k=3$. So the total number of ways is:

   $\dbinom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \dbinom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2 \cdot 1} = 28$

3) Now, for case 1 (2, 2, 2), there is only one way to distribute the balls: 2 to each child.

4) For case 2 (2, 3, 1), we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This is a multinomial coefficient:

   $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(2 \cdot 1)(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)(1)} = 60$

5) But this counts each specific distribution of balls. For example, it counts giving balls 1 and 2 to A, 3, 4, and 5 to B, and 6 to C as different from giving balls 1 and 3 to A, 2, 4, and 6 to B, and 5 to C. We don't care about which specific balls each child gets, only the number of balls. So we need to divide by the number of ways to permute the balls within each child's allocation. This is:

   $2!3!1! = 12$

6) So the actual number of ways for case 2 is:

   $\frac{60}{12} = 5$

7) Therefore, case 2 is more likely than case 1. In a large number of rounds, case 2 will occur approximately 5 times as often as case 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{case: 2}
