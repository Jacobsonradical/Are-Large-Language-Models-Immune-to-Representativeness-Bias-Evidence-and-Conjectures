To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We can use the multinomial coefficient again:
(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
