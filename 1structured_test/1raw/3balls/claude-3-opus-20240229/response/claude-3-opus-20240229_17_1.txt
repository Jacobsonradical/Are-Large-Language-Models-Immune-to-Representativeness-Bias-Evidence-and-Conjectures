Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a permutation problem. The formula is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}$ for case 1, and $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!}$ for case 2.

2) For case 1:
   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90$

3) For case 2:
   $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60$

4) This means that if we play many rounds of this game, case 1 (each child getting 2 balls) will occur more often than case 2 (one child getting 1 ball, another getting 2, and the third getting 3).

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
