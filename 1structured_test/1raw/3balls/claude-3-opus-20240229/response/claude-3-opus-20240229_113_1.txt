Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

   where $n$ is the number of balls and $k$ is the number of children.

2) In this case, $n=6$ and $k=3$. So, the total number of ways is:

   $\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2} = 28$

3) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (2,2,2): This is the number of ways to arrange 3 identical objects (the groups of 2 balls) in 3 boxes (the children). This is simply:

   $\frac{3!}{1!1!1!} = 6$

   Case 2 (2,3,1): This is the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct objects (the groups of 2, 3, and 1 ball) in 3 boxes (the children). This is simply:

   $\frac{3!}{1!1!1!} = 6$

4) Both cases have the same number of possible arrangements (6 each). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be an equal number of results of case 1 and case 2.
