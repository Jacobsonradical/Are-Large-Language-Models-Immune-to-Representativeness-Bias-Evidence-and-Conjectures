To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) than Case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will occur more often.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
