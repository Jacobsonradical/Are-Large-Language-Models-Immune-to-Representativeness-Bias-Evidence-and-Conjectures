Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle: for each of the 6 balls, there are 3 choices of which child to give it to. Therefore, the total number of distributions is:

   3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a multinomial coefficient, calculated as:

   (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the calculation is similar:

   (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

4) So, out of the 729 total possible distributions, 90 of them result in case 1, and 60 of them result in case 2.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
