Let's reason through this step by step:

1) There are 6 balls in total, and they are distinguishable. This means that the order of distribution matters.

2) To calculate the number of ways each case can occur, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

   $\binom{n}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} = \frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\ldots k_r!}$

   where $n$ is the total number of balls, and $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r$ are the number of balls each child gets.

3) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is:

   $\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

4) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is:

   $\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

5) Therefore, case 1 can occur in 90 different ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 different ways.

6) In a large number of rounds, the case with more possible ways will occur more often.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
