To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. This can be done in:
$\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90$ ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. This can be done in:
$\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$ ways

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
