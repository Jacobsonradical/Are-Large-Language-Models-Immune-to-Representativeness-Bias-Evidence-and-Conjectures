Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1) First, we need to calculate the total number of ways the 6 balls can be distributed among the three children. This can be done using the multinomial coefficient:

   $\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

2) Now, for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls, which is exactly the scenario described. So there is 1 way for case 1 to occur.

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate how many ways there are to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. This is again a multinomial coefficient:

   $\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

4) So, there are 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more often than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

Answer:
{case: 2}
