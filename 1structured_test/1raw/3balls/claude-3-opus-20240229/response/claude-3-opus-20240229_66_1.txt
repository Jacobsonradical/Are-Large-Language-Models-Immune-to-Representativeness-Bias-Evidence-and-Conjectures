To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children is:

$\frac{6!}{(2!)(2!)(2!)} = \frac{6!}{2^3} = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this pattern among 3 children is:

$\frac{6!}{(2!)(3!)(1!)} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) compared to Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
