To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can think of this as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We can think of this as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) compared to Case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will happen more frequently.
