To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can also use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) compared to case 2 (60), case 1 will happen more often in many rounds of the game.
