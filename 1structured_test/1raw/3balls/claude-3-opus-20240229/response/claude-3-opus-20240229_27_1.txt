To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

In case 1, there are 90 different ways to distribute the balls, while in case 2, there are 60 different ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.
