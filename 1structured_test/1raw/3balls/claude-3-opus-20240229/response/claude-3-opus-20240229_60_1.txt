To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C. This can be done in:

$\dbinom{6}{2} \cdot \dbinom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C. This can be done in:

$\dbinom{6}{2} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60), case 1 will happen more often in many rounds of the game.
