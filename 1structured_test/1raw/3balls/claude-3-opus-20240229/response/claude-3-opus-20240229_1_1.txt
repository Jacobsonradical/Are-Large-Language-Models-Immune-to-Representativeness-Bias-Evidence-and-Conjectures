Let's approach this problem using combinatorics. We need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
We can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, then 2 balls for B in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. 
Number of ways for case 1 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
We can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, then 3 balls for B in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of ways for case 2 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$

However, case 2 can also occur in other ways: (A:2, B:1, C:3) and (A:3, B:2, C:1). Each of these has the same number of possibilities as calculated above. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
Total number of ways for case 2 = $60 \times 3 = 180$

Therefore, case 2 will occur more often than case 1.
