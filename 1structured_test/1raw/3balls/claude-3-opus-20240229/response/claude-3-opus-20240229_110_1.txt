To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are three different ways this can happen:
(A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, C:3, B:1), and (B:2, A:3, C:1)

Each of these can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are three ways case 2 can happen, we multiply the result by 3:
60 * 3 = 180

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1.
