Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This can be done using the multinomial coefficient:

   Total ways = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): There's only one way to distribute the balls in this case, because each child must get exactly 2 balls.

   Case 1 ways = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

   Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient again:

   Case 2 ways = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

3) So, in 90 total possible distributions, 90 of them will be Case 1, and 60 of them will be Case 2.

4) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
