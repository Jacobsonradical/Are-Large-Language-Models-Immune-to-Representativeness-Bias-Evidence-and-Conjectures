Let's compute the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find how many ways we can distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

First, let's choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$ ways
Then, choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{2}$ ways
The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is: $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$ ways

Now, for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we'll use a similar approach.

Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$ ways
Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{3}$ ways
The remaining 1 ball will go to C.

The total number of ways for case 2 is: $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$ ways

As we can see, there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
