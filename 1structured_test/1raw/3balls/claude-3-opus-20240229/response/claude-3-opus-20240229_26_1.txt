Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

   where $n$ is the number of balls and $k$ is the number of children.

2) In this case, $n=6$ and $k=3$. So, the total number of ways is:

   $\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} = 28$

3) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case.

   Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): This is a case where each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways for this is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

   Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): This is a case where the distribution is specific. To calculate this, we choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The number of ways for this is:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \cdot \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$

4) We can see that Case 1 has more ways (90) than Case 2 (60).

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
