To determine which case occurs more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways can be calculated as:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways can be calculated as:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, case 1 can occur in 90 different ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 different ways.

{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
