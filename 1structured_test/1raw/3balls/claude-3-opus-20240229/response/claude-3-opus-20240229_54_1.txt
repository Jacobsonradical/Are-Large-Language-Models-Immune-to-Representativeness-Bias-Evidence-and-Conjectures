To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children:
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\dbinom{6}{2}$ = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\dbinom{4}{2}$ = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls go to C: only 1 way

Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1:
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\dbinom{6}{2}$ = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\dbinom{4}{3}$ = 4 ways
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C: only 1 way

Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
