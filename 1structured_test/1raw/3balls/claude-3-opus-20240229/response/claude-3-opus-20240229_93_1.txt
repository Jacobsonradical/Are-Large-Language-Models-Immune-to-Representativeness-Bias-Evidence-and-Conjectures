To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we can first choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining ball goes to C.
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = 15 * 4 = 60

Comparing the two cases:
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
