To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinct balls such that each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

$\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinct balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. Again, we use the multinomial coefficient:

$\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) compared to case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
