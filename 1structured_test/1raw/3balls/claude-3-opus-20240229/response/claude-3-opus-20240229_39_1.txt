To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, then 2 balls for B in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

$\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, then 3 balls for B in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

$\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
