To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is (6C2) * (4C2) + (6C2) * (4C3) = 90 + 60 = 150.

Probability of Case 1 = 90/150 = 3/5 = 0.6
Probability of Case 2 = 60/150 = 2/5 = 0.4

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
