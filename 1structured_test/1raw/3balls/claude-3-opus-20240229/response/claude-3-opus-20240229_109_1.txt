To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This means each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can calculate the number of ways this can happen using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. Again, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) compared to case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, case 1 will happen more frequently.
