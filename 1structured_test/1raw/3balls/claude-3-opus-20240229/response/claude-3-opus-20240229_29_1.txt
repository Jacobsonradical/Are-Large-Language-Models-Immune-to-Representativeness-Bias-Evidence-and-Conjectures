To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 distinguishable balls equally among 3 children, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we can also use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
