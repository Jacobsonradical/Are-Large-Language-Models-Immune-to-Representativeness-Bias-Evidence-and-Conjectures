To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur and only 60 ways for case 2 to occur, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
