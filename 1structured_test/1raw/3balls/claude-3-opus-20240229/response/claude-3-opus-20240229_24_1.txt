To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we can use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
