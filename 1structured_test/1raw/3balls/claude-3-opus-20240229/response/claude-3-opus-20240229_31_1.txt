Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a permutation problem, and the answer is:

   6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

2) Now, for case 1 (2, 2, 2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be done in:

   (6C2) * (4C2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

3) For case 2 (2, 3, 1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C. This can be done in:

   (6C2) * (4C3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

4) So, out of the total 720 possible distributions, 90 will result in case 1 and 60 will result in case 2.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
