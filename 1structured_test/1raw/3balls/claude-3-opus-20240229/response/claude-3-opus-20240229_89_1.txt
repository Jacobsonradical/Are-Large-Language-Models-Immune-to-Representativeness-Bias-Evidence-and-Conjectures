To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can calculate the number of ways as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{2}$
- The remaining 2 balls go to C: $\binom{2}{2}$

Total number of ways for case 1 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can calculate the number of ways as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{3}$
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C: $\binom{1}{1}$

Total number of ways for case 2 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$

In addition, there are other possible cases, such as (A:3, B:2, C:1) and (A:1, B:2, C:3), which also have 60 ways each.

Since case 1 has more possible ways (90) than case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
