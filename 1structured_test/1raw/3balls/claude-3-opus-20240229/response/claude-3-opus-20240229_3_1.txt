Okay, let's approach this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a simple permutation problem. The answer is 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.

2) Now, for case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be calculated as:

   (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = (6!/((2!)(4!))) * (4!/((2!)(2!)))
                                = (15) * (6) 
                                = 90

3) For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1, we calculate:

   (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = (6!/((2!)(4!))) * (4!/((3!)(1!))) 
                                = (15) * (4)
                                = 60

4) So, out of the total 720 possible distributions, 90 will result in case 1, and 60 will result in case 2.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
