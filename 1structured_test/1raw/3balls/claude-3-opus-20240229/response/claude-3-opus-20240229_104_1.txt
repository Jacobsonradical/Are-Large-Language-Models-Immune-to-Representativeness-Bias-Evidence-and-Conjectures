Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

   where n is the number of balls and k is the number of children.

   In this case, n = 6 and k = 3. So the total number of ways is:

   $\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2} = 28$

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a multinomial coefficient problem. The formula is:

   $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$

   where n is the total number of balls, and $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ are the number of balls each child gets.

   In this case, n = 6, $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 2$. So the number of ways for case 1 is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

3) Similarly, for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

4) The probability of case 1 is $\frac{90}{28} = \frac{15}{28}$, and the probability of case 2 is $\frac{60}{28} = \frac{10}{28}$.

5) Since $\frac{15}{28} > \frac{10}{28}$, case 1 is more likely to occur.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
