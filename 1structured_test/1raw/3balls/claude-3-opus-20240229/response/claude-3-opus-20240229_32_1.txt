Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways the 6 balls can be distributed among the three children. This is a permutation problem, and the formula is:

   $\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!}$ for case 1, and $\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!}$ for case 2.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we get:
   
   $\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90$

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we get:

   $\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60$

4) Therefore, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
