Let's reason through this step by step.

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a simple permutation problem. The formula is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}$ for case 1, and $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!}$ for case 2.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
   
   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{6 * 5 * 4!}{2 * 1 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 1} = \frac{720}{8} = 90$

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
   
   $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{6 * 5 * 4!}{2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60$

4) Therefore, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1, and 60 ways in case 2.

5) Since each distribution is equally likely (the balls are distributed at random), the probability of each case is proportional to the number of ways it can occur.

6) Thus, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
