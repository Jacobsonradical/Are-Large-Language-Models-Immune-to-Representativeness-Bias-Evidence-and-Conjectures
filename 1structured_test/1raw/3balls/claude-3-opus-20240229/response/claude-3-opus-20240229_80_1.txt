To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{2}$
- The remaining 2 balls go to C: $\binom{2}{2}$

Total number of ways for Case 1 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}$ = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{3}$
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C: $\binom{1}{1}$

Total number of ways for Case 2 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}$ = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
