To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Let's start with case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls for A.
- After distributing 2 balls to A, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose 2 balls for B.
- The remaining 2 balls go to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is $15 \times 6 = 90$.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls for A.
- After distributing 2 balls to A, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose 3 balls for B.
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is $15 \times 4 = 60$.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
