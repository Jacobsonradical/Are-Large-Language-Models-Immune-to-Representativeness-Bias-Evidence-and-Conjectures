To determine which case will occur more frequently, let's compute the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be done in:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C. This can be done in:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
