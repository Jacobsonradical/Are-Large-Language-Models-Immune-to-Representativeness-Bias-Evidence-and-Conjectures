To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
