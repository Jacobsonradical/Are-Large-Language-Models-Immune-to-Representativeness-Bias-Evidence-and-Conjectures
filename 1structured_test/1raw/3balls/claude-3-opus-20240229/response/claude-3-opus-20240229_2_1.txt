Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways

4) As we can see, case 1 can occur in more ways (90) than case 2 (60).

5) In a large number of rounds, each possible distribution is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the case that can occur in more ways will occur more often.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
