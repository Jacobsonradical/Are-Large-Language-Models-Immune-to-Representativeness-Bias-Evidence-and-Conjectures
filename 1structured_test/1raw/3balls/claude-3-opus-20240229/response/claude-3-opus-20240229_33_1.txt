Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C2) = 15 × 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C3) = 15 × 4 = 60 ways

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
