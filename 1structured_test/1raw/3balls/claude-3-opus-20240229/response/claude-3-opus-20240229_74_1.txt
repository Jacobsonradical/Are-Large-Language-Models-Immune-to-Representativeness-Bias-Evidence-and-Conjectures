To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can calculate the number of ways as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2) = 15
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 for B: C(4,2) = 6
- The remaining 2 balls go to C

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is: 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can calculate the number of ways as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2) = 15
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 for B: C(4,3) = 4
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is: 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) compared to case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently.
