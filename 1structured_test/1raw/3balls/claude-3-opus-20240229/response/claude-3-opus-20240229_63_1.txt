Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   (n+k-1) choose (k-1), where n is the number of balls and k is the number of children.

   In this case, (6+3-1) choose (3-1) = 8 choose 2 = 28.

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): This is equivalent to choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, it's:

   (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

   Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): This is equivalent to choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, it's:

   (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

3) Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

   Case 1: 90 / 28 = 45 / 14 ≈ 3.21
   Case 2: 60 / 28 = 30 / 14 ≈ 2.14

4) Therefore, Case 1 is more likely to occur.
