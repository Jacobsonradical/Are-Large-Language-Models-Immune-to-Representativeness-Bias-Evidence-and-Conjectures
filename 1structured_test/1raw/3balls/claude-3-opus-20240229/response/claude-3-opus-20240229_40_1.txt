Let's approach this problem step by step.

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children. This is a simple permutation problem. The answer is:

   6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

2) Now, let's consider case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). To calculate the number of ways to achieve this distribution, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be calculated as:

   (6C2) * (4C2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
               = (6! / (2! * (2! * 2!))) 
               = 90

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 goes to C. This can be calculated as:

   (6C2) * (4C3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) 
               = (6! / (2! * (3! * 1!)))
               = 60

4) Therefore, out of the total 720 possible distributions, 90 will result in case 1 and 60 will result in case 2.

5) Since 90 > 60, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
