Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a permutation problem, and the number of ways is 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 
   - Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
   - Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C2 = 6
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C
   - But the order of distribution (A, B, C) also matters, so we multiply by 3! = 6
   - Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 x 6 x 6 = 540

   Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
   - Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
   - Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C3 = 4
   - The remaining 1 ball goes to C
   - Again, the order of distribution matters, so we multiply by 3! = 6
   - Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 x 4 x 6 = 360

3) Therefore, out of the total 720 possible distributions, 540 belong to Case 1 and 360 belong to Case 2.

4) Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
