Let's reason through this step-by-step.

1) First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90$ ways.

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$ ways.

4) So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1, and 60 ways in case 2.

5) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
