To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and only 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
