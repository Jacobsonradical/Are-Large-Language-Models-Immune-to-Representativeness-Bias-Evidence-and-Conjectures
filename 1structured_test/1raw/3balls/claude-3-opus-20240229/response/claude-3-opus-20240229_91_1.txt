To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children. The number of ways to do this is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The number of ways to do this is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) than Case 2 (60), Case 1 will happen more often in many rounds of the game.
