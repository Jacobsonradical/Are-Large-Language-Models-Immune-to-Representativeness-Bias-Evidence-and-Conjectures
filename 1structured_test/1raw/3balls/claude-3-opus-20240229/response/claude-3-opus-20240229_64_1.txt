To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

$\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. Again, using the multinomial coefficient:

$\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), we expect that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
