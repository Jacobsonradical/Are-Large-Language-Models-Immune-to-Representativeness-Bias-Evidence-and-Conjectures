To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) compared to Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
