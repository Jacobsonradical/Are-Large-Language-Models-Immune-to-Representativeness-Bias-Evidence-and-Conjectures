Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a simple permutation problem. The answer is 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.

2) Now, for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to calculate how many ways we can choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. This is a multinomial coefficient problem. 

   Number of ways for case 1 = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / 8 = 90

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we similarly calculate how many ways we can choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.

   Number of ways for case 2 = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / 12 = 60

4) Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, 
{case: 1}
