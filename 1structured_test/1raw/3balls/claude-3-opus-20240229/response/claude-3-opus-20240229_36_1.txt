To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is:
$\frac{6!}{(2!)^3} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball, is:
$\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
