To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) compared to Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
