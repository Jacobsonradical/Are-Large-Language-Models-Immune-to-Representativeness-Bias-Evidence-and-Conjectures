To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls equally among three children. We can do this by first choosing 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.

Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2)
                = 15 × 6 × 1
                = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1)
                = 15 × 4 × 1
                = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
