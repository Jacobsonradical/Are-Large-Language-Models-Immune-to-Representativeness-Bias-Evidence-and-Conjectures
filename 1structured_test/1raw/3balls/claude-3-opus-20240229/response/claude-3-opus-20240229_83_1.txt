To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case. Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{2}$
- The remaining 2 balls go to C: $\binom{2}{2}$

Total number of ways for case 1 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}$
= $\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \times \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!}$
= $15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90$

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
- Choose 2 balls for A: $\binom{6}{2}$
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: $\binom{4}{3}$
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C: $\binom{1}{1}$

Total number of ways for case 2 = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}$
= $\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} \times \frac{1!}{1!(1-1)!}$
= $15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$

Step 3: Compare the number of ways for case 1 and case 2.
Case 1 has 90 ways, while case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently.
