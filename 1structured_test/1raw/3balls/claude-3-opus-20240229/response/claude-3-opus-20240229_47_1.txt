Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1) There are 6 balls in total, and they are all distinguishable. This means that the order of distribution matters. 

2) In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. We can calculate the number of ways this can happen:
   - First, choose 2 balls for A: there are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to do this.
   - Then, from the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 for B: there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to do this.
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   - So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90.

3) In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:
   - Choose 2 balls for A: there are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to do this.
   - From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 for B: there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to do this.
   - The last ball goes to C.
   - The total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

4) There is also the case where A gets 2 balls, C gets 3 balls, and B gets 1 ball. This is equivalent to case 2, so there are also 60 ways for this to happen.

5) In total, there are 90 ways for case 1 to happen, and 60 + 60 = 120 ways for case 2 (including the equivalent case) to happen.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 (including the equivalent case) will occur more often than case 1.
