To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can choose 2 balls for A in $\dbinom{6}{2}$ ways, then 2 balls for B in $\dbinom{4}{2}$ ways, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

$\dbinom{6}{2} \cdot \dbinom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can choose 2 balls for A in $\dbinom{6}{2}$ ways, then 3 balls for B in $\dbinom{4}{3}$ ways, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

$\dbinom{6}{2} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) compared to case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, case 1 will happen more often than case 2.
