Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways the balls can be distributed. This is a permutation problem, as the balls are distinguishable. The formula is:

   Total arrangements = 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways case 1 can occur. This is a multinomial coefficient problem. The formula is:

   Case 1 arrangements = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

3) Similarly, for case 2:

   Case 2 arrangements = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

4) Probability of case 1 = 90 / 720 = 1/8
   Probability of case 2 = 60 / 720 = 1/12

5) Since 1/8 > 1/12, case 1 is more likely to occur.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
