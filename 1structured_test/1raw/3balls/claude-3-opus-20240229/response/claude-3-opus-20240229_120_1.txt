To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball, is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) than Case 2 (60), Case 1 will happen more often in many rounds of the game.
