To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls equally among 3 children is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, select 2 balls for A: (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
Then, select 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
The remaining ball goes to C: (1 choose 1) = 1 way
Total number of ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Comparing the two cases:
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more often than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
