To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:
(6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we can first choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C:
(6C2) * (4C3) * (1C1) = (15) * (4) * (1) = 60

Therefore, case 1 will occur more often than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
