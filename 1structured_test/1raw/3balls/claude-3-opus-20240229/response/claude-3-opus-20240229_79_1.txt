Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
   - We can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
   - Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we can choose 2 for B in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways.
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   - So, the total number of ways for case 1 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$.

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
   - We can choose 2 balls for A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
   - Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we can choose 3 for B in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways.
   - The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
   - So, the total number of ways for case 2 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$.

3) Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
