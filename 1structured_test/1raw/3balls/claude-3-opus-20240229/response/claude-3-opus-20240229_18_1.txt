To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
$\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
$\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
