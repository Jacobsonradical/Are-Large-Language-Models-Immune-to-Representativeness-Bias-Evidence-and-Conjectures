To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls equally among 3 children, we use the multinomial coefficient:
(6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) = (6! / (2^3)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls in this specific arrangement, we use the multinomial coefficient:
(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls equally (case 1) and only 60 ways to distribute them as in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
