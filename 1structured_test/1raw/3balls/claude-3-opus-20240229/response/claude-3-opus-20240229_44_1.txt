Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. This is a classic "Stars and Bars" problem in combinatorics. The formula is:

   $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$

   where $n$ is the number of balls and $k$ is the number of children.

   In this case, $n=6$ and $k=3$. So, the total number of ways is:

   $\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2} = 28$

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (2, 2, 2): This is a multinomial coefficient problem. The formula is:

   $\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$

   where $n$ is the total number of balls, and $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ are the number of balls each child gets.

   In this case, $n=6$, $n_1=n_2=n_3=2$. So, the number of ways for Case 1 is:

   $\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

   Case 2 (2, 3, 1): Again, using the multinomial coefficient formula:

   $\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

3) Since the balls are distributed randomly, the probability of each case is proportional to the number of ways it can occur. The case with a higher number of ways is more likely to occur.

   Case 1 has 90 ways, while Case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, Case 1 is more likely to occur.
