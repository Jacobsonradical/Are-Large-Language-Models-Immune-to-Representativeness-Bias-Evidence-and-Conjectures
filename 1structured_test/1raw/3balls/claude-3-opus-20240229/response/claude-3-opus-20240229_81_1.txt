Let's compute the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2) = 15
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 for B: C(4,2) = 6
- The remaining 2 balls go to C

Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2) = 15
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 for B: C(4,3) = 4
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C

Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60

However, case 2 can also occur in other ways:
- A:2, B:1, C:3
- A:3, B:2, C:1
- A:1, B:2, C:3
- A:3, B:1, C:2
- A:1, B:3, C:2

Each of these has the same number of possibilities as the original case 2 (60). 

So, the total number of ways for case 2 = 60 * 6 = 360

Comparing the two:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 360 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
