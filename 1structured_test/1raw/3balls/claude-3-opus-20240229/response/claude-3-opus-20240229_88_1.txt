Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a permutation problem and the number of ways is:

   6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

2) Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

   Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 
   The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is $\binom{6}{2}$, then 2 balls for B is $\binom{4}{2}$, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
   So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

   $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$

   Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
   The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is $\binom{6}{2}$, then 3 balls for B is $\binom{4}{3}$, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
   So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

   $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$

3) We can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
