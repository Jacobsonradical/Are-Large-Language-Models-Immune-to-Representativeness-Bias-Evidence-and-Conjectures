To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls equally among three children. We can calculate the number of ways using the multinomial coefficient:
(6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. We can calculate the number of ways using the multinomial coefficient:
(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) compared to Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
