To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls equally among 3 children. We can calculate the number of ways using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. We can calculate the number of ways using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are 90 ways for Case 1 to happen and only 60 ways for Case 2 to happen, Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
