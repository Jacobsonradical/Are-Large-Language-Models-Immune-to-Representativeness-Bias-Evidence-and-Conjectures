To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 can occur in 90 different ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 different ways.

Since the balls are distributed randomly, each distribution has an equal probability of occurring. As case 1 has more possible distributions (90) compared to case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
