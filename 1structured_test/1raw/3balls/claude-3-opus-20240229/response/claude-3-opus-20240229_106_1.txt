Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1) First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle:

   There are 3 choices for the first ball, 3 for the second, and so on. So the total number of distributions is 3^6 = 729.

2) Now, for case 1 (2, 2, 2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90$ ways.

3) For case 2 (2, 3, 1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60$ ways.

4) Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, my answer is:

{case: 1}
