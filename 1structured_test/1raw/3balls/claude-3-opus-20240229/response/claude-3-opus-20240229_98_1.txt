To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the number of ways this case can happen, we use the multinomial coefficient:
$\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for this case:
$\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) than Case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
