To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.
Number of ways = (6C2) * (4C3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.
