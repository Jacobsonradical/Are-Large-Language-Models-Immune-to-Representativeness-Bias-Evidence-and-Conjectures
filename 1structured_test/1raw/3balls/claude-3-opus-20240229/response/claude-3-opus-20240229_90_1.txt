To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C.
Number of ways = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
