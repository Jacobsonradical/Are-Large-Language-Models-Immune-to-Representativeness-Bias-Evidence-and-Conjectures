To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

$\frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

$\frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = 60$

Reasoning:
- In case 1, we distribute 2 balls to each child, and the order of distribution within each child's group doesn't matter. So, we divide by 2! for each child.
- In case 2, we distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. Again, the order within each child's group doesn't matter, so we divide by 2!, 3!, and 1! respectively.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
