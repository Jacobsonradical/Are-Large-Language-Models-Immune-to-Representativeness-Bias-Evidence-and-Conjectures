Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1) First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

2) For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways

3) For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 will go to C. This can be done in:

   $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways

4) As we can see, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 than in case 2.

5) In a large number of rounds, each possible distribution is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the case with more possible distributions will occur more often.

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
