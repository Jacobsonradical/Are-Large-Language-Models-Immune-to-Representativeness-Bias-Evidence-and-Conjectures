To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
$\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(2 \cdot 1) \cdot (2 \cdot 1) \cdot (2 \cdot 1)} = \frac{720}{8} = 90$

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
$\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{(2 \cdot 1) \cdot (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60$

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
