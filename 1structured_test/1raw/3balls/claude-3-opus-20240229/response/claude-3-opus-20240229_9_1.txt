To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Number of ways = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, we first choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of ways = $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

{case: 1}
