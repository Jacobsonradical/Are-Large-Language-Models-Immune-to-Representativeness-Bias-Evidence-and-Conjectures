Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable:

* **Case 1:** Two balls go to each child (A, B, and C).
* **Case 2:** Two balls go to A, three to B, and one to C.

**Calculating Probabilities**

1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C).  So the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729.

2. **Case 1 Outcomes:**
   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6, which can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
   * **Choosing 2 balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, so we choose 2 in ⁴C₂ ways = 6 ways.
   * **Choosing 2 balls for C:**  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   * **Total Case 1 Outcomes:** 15 * 6 = 90

3. **Case 2 Outcomes:**
   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   * **Choosing 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   * **Choosing 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   * **Total Case 2 Outcomes:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Probability Comparison**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher (20/243) than the probability of Case 1 (10/81), we can conclude:

**{case: 2}**
