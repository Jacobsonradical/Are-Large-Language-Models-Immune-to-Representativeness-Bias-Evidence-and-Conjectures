Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  For each ball, there are 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is ⁶C₂ = 15.
    * So, the total combinations for Case 1 are 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375
    * Probability of Case 1: 3375 / 729 ≈ 4.63

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Choose 3 balls for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 
    * Choose 1 ball for C: ¹C₁ = 1
    * Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60
    * Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729 ≈ 0.08

**Conclusion**

The probability of Case 1 is significantly higher than the probability of Case 2.  Therefore, over many rounds of the game, we expect to see **Case 1 occur more often**.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
