Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  
* The total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

* **Choosing the balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Choosing the balls for B:** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2. This is ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
* **Total outcomes for case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

* **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total outcomes for case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the results**

Case 1 has 90 outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 outcomes.

**Answer:** {case: 1} 

**Conclusion:** Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
