Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls and 3 children, so each ball has 3 choices.
* The total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total outcomes for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Reason:** Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.
