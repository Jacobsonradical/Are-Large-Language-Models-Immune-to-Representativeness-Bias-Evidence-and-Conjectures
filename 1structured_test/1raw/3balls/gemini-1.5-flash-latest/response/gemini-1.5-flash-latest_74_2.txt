Here's how we can figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable Balls:**  Each ball is unique (imagine they're different colors).
* **Random Distribution:**  The children receive balls randomly, with no preference.

**Calculating Probabilities**

To compare the cases, we'll calculate the probability of each outcome happening in a single round.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   3. **The remaining balls go to C:**  There's only 1 way to give the last 2 balls to C.

   4. **Total arrangements:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

   5. **Total possible distributions:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

   6. **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 = 10/81

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** 1 way.

   4. **Total arrangements:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

   5. **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

* The probability of Case 1 is 10/81.
* The probability of Case 2 is 20/243.

Since 20/243 is greater than 10/81, **Case 2 is more likely to occur**.

**Answer:** {case: 2}
