Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them.  The case with the higher probability will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total possible outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    * We need to choose 2 balls for A (6 choose 2 ways), 2 for B (4 choose 2 ways), and the remaining 2 for C.
    * This gives us: (6C2) * (4C2) * (2C2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    * Choose 2 balls for A (6C2 ways), 3 balls for B (4C3 ways), and the remaining 1 ball for C (1C1 way).
    * This gives us: (6C2) * (4C3) * (1C1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

**Probability Comparison**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

**{case: 1}**
