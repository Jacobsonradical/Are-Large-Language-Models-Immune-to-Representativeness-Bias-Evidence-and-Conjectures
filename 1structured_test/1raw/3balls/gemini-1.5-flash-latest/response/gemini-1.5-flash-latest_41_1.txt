Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the balls are given to each child doesn't matter. We need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

**Calculating the Possibilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   - We have 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A. The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₂ = 15.
   - After giving 2 to A, we have 4 left, and we need to choose 2 for B. This is ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
   - The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   - To get the total combinations for case 1, we multiply: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - We need 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   - Then 3 balls for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   - The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   - Total combinations for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways for case 1 to occur and only 60 ways for case 2. 

**Answer: {case: 1}**
