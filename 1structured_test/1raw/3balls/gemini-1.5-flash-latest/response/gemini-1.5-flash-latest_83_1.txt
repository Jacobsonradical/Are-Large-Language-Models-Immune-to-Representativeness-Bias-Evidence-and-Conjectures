Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible distributions**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible distributions.

**2. Calculate the number of distributions for each case**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.  
    * The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

**3. Compare the probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
