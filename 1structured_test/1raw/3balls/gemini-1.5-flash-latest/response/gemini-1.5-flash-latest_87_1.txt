Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each of the 6 balls, there are 3 possible children it can go to.
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. 
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15
    * Same for B and C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 
    * However, we've overcounted!  The order we choose the groups (A then B then C, or B then C then A, etc.) doesn't matter. We've counted each unique outcome 3! (3 factorial) times. 
    * Corrected outcomes for Case 1: 3375 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 562.5 
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Ways to choose 3 balls for B: ⁴C₃ = (4 * 3 * 2) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 4
    * The remaining ball goes to C automatically.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the outcomes:**

Case 1 has significantly more possible outcomes (562.5) than Case 2 (60).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
