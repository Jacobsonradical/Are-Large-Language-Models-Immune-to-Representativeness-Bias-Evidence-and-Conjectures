Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), giving us a total of 3⁶ = 729 possible outcomes.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways. 
    *  Probability of Case 1: 90/729 

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    *  Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
