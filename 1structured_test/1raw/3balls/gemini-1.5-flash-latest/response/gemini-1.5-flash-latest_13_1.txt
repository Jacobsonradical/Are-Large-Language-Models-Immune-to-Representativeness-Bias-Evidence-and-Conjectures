Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, the total number of possible outcomes is 3^6 = 729.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Since the balls are distinguishable, we need to account for the order of assigning balls within each group. We can arrange 2 balls in 2! = 2 ways.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 720

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Arrange balls within each group: 2! * 3! = 12 ways
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 12 = 720

**3. Compare the outcomes:**

Both Case 1 and Case 2 have the same number of possible outcomes: 720.

**Answer:**

{case: **neither**, both cases are equally likely}
