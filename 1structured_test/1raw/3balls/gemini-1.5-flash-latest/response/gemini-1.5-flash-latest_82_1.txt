Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to determine the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with the higher probability is the one we'll see more often over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls, giving us a total of 3⁶ = 729 possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 Probability:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways (using combinations). 
    *  This simplifies to (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * (2!/(2!0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    *  The probability of case 1 is 90/729.

* **Case 2 Probability:**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways.
    * This simplifies to (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(3!1!)) * (1!/(1!0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    *  The probability of case 2 is 60/729.

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has a higher probability (90/729) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) (60/729).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
