Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the balls are given to the children doesn't matter. We need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1:**  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  The number of ways to do this is:

   *  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * (2!/(2!0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2:**  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.  The number of ways to do this is:

   * ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(3!1!)) * (1!/(1!0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.  

**Answer:** {case: 1}
