Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to compare the probability of getting two balls for each child (case 1) versus the probability of getting a specific distribution of 2, 3, and 1 balls (case 2).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls, so there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups of balls doesn't matter (A then B then C is the same as B then A then C). We have 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Similar to case 1, we've overcounted because the order of choosing the groups doesn't matter (3! = 6 ways to order them).
    * Total outcomes for case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Explanation**

There are 15 possible outcomes for case 1 and only 10 possible outcomes for case 2.  Since each outcome is equally likely, case 1 is more likely to occur.
