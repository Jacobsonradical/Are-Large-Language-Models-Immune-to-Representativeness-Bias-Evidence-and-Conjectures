Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children.  So there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15 ways.
    * Then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted because we can choose the same 2 balls for A, B, and C in different orders. We need to divide by 3! (3 * 2 * 1 = 6) to correct for this.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = (4 * 3 * 2) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 15 / 729
* Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Case 2 is more likely to occur.

**Answer: {case: 2}**
