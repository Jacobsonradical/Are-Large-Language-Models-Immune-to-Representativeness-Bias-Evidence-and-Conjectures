Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the Number of Outcomes for Each Case**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   - Choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   - The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   - Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   - Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   - The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
   - Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the Probabilities**

* **Case 1 Probability:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123 
* **Case 2 Probability:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Reasoning:**

Case 1 is more likely to occur because there are more ways to distribute the balls in a 2-2-2 pattern compared to a 2-3-1 pattern. This is reflected in the higher probability of Case 1 occurring.
