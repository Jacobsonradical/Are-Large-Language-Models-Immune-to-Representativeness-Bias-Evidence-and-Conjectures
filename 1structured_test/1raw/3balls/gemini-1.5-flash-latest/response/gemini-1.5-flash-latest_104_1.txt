Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups (A then B then C) doesn't matter. We need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 groups: 3! = 6
    * Total ways for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**
    * The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ (each ball has 3 choices).

* **Probabilities:**
    * Probability of Case 1: 15 / 3⁶ = 5/729
    * Probability of Case 2: 60 / 3⁶ = 20/729

**Conclusion**

Case 2 has a higher probability of occurring (20/729) than Case 1 (5/729).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
