Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and then compare them.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). Since there are 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways. 
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Over many rounds of the game, you are more likely to see the balls distributed as in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
