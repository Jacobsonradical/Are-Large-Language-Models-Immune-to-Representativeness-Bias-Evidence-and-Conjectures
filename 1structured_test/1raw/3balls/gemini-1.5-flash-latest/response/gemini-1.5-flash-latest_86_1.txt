Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls and 3 children, so each ball has 3 options.
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = (6 * 5)/(2 * 1) = 15
    * Similarly for B and C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). We've counted each outcome 3! = 6 times.
    * Correct outcomes for Case 1: 3375 / 6 = 562.5 
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
    * Choose 3 balls for B: 4C3 = 4
    * The remaining ball goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 562.5 / 729 ≈ 0.77
* Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729 ≈ 0.08

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Reasoning:**

Case 1 is significantly more likely to occur than Case 2 because the probability of getting an even distribution of balls among the children is much higher than getting an uneven distribution.
