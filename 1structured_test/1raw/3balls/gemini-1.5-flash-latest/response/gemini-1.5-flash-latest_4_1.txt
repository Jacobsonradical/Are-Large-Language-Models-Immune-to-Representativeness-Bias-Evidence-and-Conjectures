Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with a higher probability will be more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   - We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Then, choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   - The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   - However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups (A, then B, then C) doesn't matter.  There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.

   - Total ways for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   - The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   - Again, we've overcounted the order of choosing groups (A, then B, then C). 

   - Total ways for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**Total Possible Outcomes**

Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible outcomes.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* Probability of Case 1: 15/729 
* Probability of Case 2: 10/729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, **Case 1 will be more likely to occur over many rounds.**

**Answer:** {case: 1}
