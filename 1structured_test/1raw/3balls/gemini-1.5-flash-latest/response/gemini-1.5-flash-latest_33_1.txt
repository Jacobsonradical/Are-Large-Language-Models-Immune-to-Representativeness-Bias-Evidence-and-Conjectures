Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring.  Since the balls are distinguishable, each arrangement of balls among the children is unique.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**
    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing the Probabilities**

* **Total possible arrangements:**  Each of the 6 balls can go to one of three children, so there are 3⁶ = 729 possible arrangements. 
* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Answer:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, we can conclude:

{case: 1}
