Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Case**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
    * This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) ways = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90 / 729 
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) ways = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**3. Compare the Probabilities**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
