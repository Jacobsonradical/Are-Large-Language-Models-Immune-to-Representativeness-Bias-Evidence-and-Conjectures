Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them.  The case with the higher probability is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C). So, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * The number of ways to do this is: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 
    * Probability of Case 1: 90 / 729

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to do this is: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60
    * Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), Case 1 is more likely to occur.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
