Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur when randomly distributing 6 balls among 3 children.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 children, and each ball has 3 choices, so there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.
    *  However, we've overcounted! We can arrange the groups of 2 balls in 3! = 6 ways (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). 
    *  Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 1 is (15 * 6 * 6) / 6 = 90.
    *  Probability of Case 1: 90 / 729

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    *  Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 3 balls for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    *  The remaining ball goes to C automatically.
    *  Similar to case 1, we've overcounted. We can arrange the groups of 2, 3, and 1 balls in 3! = 6 ways.
    *  Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 2 is (15 * 4 * 6) / 6 = 60
    *  Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**Answer**

Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring than case 2.

**{case: 1}**
