Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with the higher probability will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 children and 6 balls.  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways (using combinations).  
    * ⁶C₂ = 15, ⁴C₂ = 6, ²C₂ = 1. So, there are 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways for Case 1.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways.
    * ⁶C₂ = 15, ⁴C₃ = 4, ¹C₁ = 1. So, there are 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways for Case 2.

**Probability**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, Case 1 will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game.

**{case: 1}**
