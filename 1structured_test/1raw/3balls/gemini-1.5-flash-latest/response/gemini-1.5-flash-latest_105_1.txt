Here's how we can determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the problem:**

* We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children.
* We want to compare the likelihood of two specific distributions:
    * Case 1:  A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
    * Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

**Calculating Probabilities:**

To compare the likelihood, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

**General Approach:**

1. **Calculate the total possible outcomes:** The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the stars and bars method. We have 6 balls (stars) and need 2 dividers (bars) to separate them into 3 groups. The number of arrangements of this is (6+2)!/(6!2!) = 28.

2. **Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

    * **Case 1:** To get 2 balls for each child, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.  This can be done in 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 ways, which equals 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
    * **Case 2:**  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 ways, which equals 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

3. **Calculate the probabilities:**

    * **Probability of Case 1:** 90/28 = 15/7
    * **Probability of Case 2:** 60/28 = 15/7

**Conclusion:**

Both Case 1 and Case 2 have the same probability of occurring.

**Answer:**

{case: **neither**, they are equally likely}
