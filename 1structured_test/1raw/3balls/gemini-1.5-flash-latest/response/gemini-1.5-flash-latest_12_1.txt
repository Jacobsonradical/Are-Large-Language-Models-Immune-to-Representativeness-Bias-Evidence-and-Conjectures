Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round of the game.  The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to do this (6 choose 2).
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to do this (4 remaining balls choose 2).
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** There's only 1 way this can happen.

   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C:** There's only 1 way this can happen.

   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total possible outcomes:** There are 3⁶ = 729 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children (each ball has 3 choices).

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

Case 2 has a higher probability (20/243) than Case 1 (10/81).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
