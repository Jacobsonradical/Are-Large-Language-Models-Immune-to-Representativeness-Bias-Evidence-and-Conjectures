Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are  ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 (6!/(2!4!) = 15).
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 (4!/(2!2!) = 6).
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:**  There's only 1 way this can happen.

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C:** 1 way.

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Total Possible Arrangements**

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ (each ball has 3 choices). This is because each ball can go to A, B, or C.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** (90 / 3⁶) = 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** (60 / 3⁶) = 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

The probability of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
