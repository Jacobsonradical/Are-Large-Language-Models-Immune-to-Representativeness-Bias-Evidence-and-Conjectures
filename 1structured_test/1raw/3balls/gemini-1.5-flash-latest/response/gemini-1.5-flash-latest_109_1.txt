Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways. 
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). 
    * We need to divide by 3! (3 factorial) to account for the permutations of the groups: 90 / 6 = 15 ways.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15 / 729 ≈ 0.0206
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 ≈ 0.0823

**Conclusion:**

{case: 2}  

Case 2 will occur more often than Case 1 because it has a higher probability of occurring.
