Here's how to figure out which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to calculate the probability of each case occurring in a single round and compare them. The case with the higher probability is more likely to occur in many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways 
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:**  There's only 1 way to do this.

   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Calculating Probability**

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:** Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81

* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher (20/243) than the probability of Case 1 (10/81), **Case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.**

**{case: 2}**
