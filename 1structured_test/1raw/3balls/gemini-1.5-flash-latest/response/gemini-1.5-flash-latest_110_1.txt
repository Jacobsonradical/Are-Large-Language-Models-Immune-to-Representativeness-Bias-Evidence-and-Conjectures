Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the balls are distributed to the children doesn't matter. 

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest go to C. 
   - The number of ways to do this is:  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest go to C.
   - The number of ways to do this is: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**

   - There are 3⁶ = 729 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children (each ball has 3 choices).

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, we can conclude that **Case 1 will occur more often**.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
