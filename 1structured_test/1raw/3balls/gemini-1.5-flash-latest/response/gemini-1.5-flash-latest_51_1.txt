Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations because the order in which the balls are distributed to each child doesn't matter.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   * Ways to choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15
   * Ways to choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4): ⁴C₂ = 6
   * Ways to choose 2 balls for C (from the remaining 2): ²C₂ = 1
   * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15
   * Ways to choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4): ⁴C₃ = 4
   * Ways to choose 1 ball for C (from the remaining 1): ¹C₁ = 1
   * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to achieve Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). 

**Answer:** {case: 1}
