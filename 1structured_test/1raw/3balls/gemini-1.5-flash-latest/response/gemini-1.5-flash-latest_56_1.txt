Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and then compare them.  The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), giving us a total of 3⁶ = 729 possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    * **Choosing the balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6, which can be done in  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * **Choosing the balls for B:** We now have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2, which can be done in ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    * **The remaining balls go to C.**

    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    * **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * **The remaining ball goes to C.**

    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Probability and Conclusion**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, Case 1 will occur more often over many rounds.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
