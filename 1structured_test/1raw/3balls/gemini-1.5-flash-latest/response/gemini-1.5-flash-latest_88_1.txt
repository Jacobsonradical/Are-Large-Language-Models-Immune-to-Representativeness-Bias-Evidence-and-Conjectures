Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to compare the probability of getting two balls for each child (case 1) versus the probability of getting a specific distribution of 2, 3, and 1 balls (case 2).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * However, we've overcounted because we could have chosen the same 2 balls for A and B in different orders. We need to divide by 3! (3 factorial) to account for the order of choosing the groups.
    * Total possibilities for case 1: (15 * 6) / 3! = 15 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * We don't need to adjust for overcounting here because the order of assigning groups matters (A:2, B:3, C:1 is different from C:1, B:3, A:2).
    * Total possibilities for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 ways

**Comparison**

Case 2 has many more possible outcomes (60) than case 1 (15).

**Answer**

{case: 2}
