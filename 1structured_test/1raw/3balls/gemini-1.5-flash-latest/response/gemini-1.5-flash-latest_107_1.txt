Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways to distribute the balls satisfy each case and compare the number of possibilities.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Step 1: Choose the balls for A.** There are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Step 2: Choose the balls for B.** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
* **Step 3: The remaining balls automatically go to C.**

* **Total possibilities for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Step 1: Choose the balls for A.**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Step 2: Choose the balls for B.** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways 
* **Step 3: The remaining ball automatically goes to C.**

* **Total possibilities for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 possibilities) than in Case 2 (60 possibilities). 

**Answer:** {case: 1}
