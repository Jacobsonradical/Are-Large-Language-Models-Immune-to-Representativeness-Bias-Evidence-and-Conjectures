Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more probable when 6 balls are randomly assigned to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of possible outcomes is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * However, we've overcounted because the order we choose the groups of 2 doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB).  There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups, so we divide by 6: 90 / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.  This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways. 
    * Again, we've overcounted because the order of the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups, so we divide by 6: 60 / 6 = 10

**Conclusion**

* Case 1: 15 possible outcomes
* Case 2: 10 possible outcomes

**Answer:** {case: 1}

**In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).**
