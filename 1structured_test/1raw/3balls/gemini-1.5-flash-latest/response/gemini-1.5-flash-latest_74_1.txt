Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.  The probability is the number of successful outcomes (ways to get that case) divided by the total possible outcomes.

**Calculating the Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). Since there are 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Choosing the balls:** We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * **Arranging within each child:** The balls are distinguishable, so the order we give them to each child matters. We can arrange 2 balls in 2! = 2 ways. Since there are 3 children, we multiply this by 2! three times. 
    * **Total for Case 1:** 90 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 720 ways.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Choosing the balls:** We need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * **Arranging within each child:** Similar to Case 1, we need to account for the order of balls within each child.  We have 2! ways for A, 3! ways for B, and 1! way for C.
    * **Total for Case 2:** 60 * 2 * 6 * 1 = 720 ways.

**Comparing the Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 720 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 720 / 729

**Answer**

Both Case 1 and Case 2 have the same probability of occurring.

**{case: neither, they are equally likely}**
