Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to compare the probabilities of two specific outcomes when distributing six balls among three children.  

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 possible ways to distribute them.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729 = 10/81

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729 = 20/243

**Comparing Probabilities**

Since 20/243 is greater than 10/81, Case 2 is more likely to occur.

**Answer:**

{case: 2}
