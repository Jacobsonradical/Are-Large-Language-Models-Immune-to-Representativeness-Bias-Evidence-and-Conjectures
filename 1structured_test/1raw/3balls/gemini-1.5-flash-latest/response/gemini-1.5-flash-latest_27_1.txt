Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more likely to occur randomly.  To do this, we'll calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining balls):** ⁴C₂ = 6 (4 choose 2)
   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for C (the remaining balls):** ²C₂ = 1 (2 choose 2)
   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15
   * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining balls):** ⁴C₃ = 4 (4 choose 3)
   * **Ways to choose 1 ball for C (the remaining ball):** ¹C₁ = 1 (1 choose 1)
   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Total Possible Outcomes** 
   * There are 3⁶ = 729 total ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children (each ball has 3 possible destinations).

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

Since 10/81 < 20/243, Case 2 is more likely to occur.

**Answer:** {case: 2}
