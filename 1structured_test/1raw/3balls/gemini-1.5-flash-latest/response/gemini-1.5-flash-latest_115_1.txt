Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round.  The case with the higher probability is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted because we could have chosen the balls for A, B, and C in any order. There are 3! = 6 ways to order 3 things.
    * So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C.
    * Again, we've overcounted due to order (3! = 6 ways to order A, B, and C).
    * The total number of ways for Case 2 is (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible outcomes for distributing the balls.

**Probability:**

* Probability of Case 1: 15 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 10 / 729

**Answer:**

{case: **1**, 1 or 2}

**Conclusion:** Case 1 is more likely to occur because it has a higher probability than Case 2.
