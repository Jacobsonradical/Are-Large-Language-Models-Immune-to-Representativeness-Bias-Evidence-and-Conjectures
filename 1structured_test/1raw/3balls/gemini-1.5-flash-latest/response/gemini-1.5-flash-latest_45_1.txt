Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total possible distributions:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the possibilities for each case:**

* **Case 1:** We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.  (We use combinations because the order we choose the balls doesn't matter)
* **Case 2:**  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, there will be more results of **Case 1**.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
