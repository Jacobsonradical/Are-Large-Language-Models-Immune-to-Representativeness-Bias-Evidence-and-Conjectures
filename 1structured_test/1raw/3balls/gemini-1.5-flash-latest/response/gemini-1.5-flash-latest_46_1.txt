Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur when 6 balls are randomly assigned to three children.

**Calculations**

* **Total possible outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  Since we have 6 balls, the total number of possible outcomes is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1:**  To calculate the number of ways to get 2 balls for each child, we can use combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is 6C2 = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15.  Since the same logic applies to children B and C, the total number of outcomes for case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

* **Case 2:** For case 2, we need:
    * 2 balls for A (6C2 = 15 ways)
    * 3 balls for B (6C3 = 20 ways)
    * 1 ball for C (6C1 = 6 ways)

    The total number of outcomes for case 2 is 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800.

**Probability**

* **Case 1 Probability:** 3375 / 729 ≈ 4.63
* **Case 2 Probability:** 1800 / 729 ≈ 2.47

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Reasoning**

Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring than case 2 because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.  This makes intuitive sense – it's more likely for the balls to be split relatively equally than to have a significant imbalance.
