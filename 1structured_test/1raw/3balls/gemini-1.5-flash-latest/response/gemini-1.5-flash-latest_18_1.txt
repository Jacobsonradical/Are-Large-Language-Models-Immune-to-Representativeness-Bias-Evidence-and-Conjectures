Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining:** ⁴C₂ = 6 (4 choose 2)
   * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15
   * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining:** ⁴C₃ = 4 (4 choose 3)
   * **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Finding the Probability**

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:**  3⁶ = 729 (Each ball has 3 choices of children)

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81

* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1,  over many rounds of the game, there will be **more results of Case 2**.

**Answer:** {case: 2}
