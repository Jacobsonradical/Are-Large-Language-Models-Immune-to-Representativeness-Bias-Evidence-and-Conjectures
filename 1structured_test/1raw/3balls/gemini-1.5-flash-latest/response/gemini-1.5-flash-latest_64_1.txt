Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children. 
* So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups of balls doesn't matter (A then B, or B then A is the same outcome). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Again, we need to account for the order of choosing groups (A then B, or B then A), which gives us 2! = 2 ways.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 2 = 30

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 15 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 30 / 729

**Answer:** 
Since the probability of Case 2 is higher, **{case: 2}** will occur more often.
