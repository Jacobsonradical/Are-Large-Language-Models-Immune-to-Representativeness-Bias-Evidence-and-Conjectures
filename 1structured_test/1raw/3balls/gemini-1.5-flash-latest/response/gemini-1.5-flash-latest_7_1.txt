Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    *  Then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    *  The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.
    *  Total for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 outcomes.
* **Case 2:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    *  Then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    *  The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.
    *  Total for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 outcomes.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer:**

{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**

Case 1 is more likely to occur because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly (2 for each child) than to have a distribution where one child gets 3 balls and another gets only 1.
