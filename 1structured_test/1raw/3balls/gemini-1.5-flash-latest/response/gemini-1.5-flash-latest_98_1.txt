Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* Since we have 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
   * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   * However, we've overcounted because the order we chose the balls (A then B then C) doesn't matter.  We've counted each arrangement 3! (3*2*1 = 6) times.
   * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining ball goes to C.
   * Again, we've overcounted because the order of choosing doesn't matter. We've counted each arrangement 3! times.
   * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**3. Compare the results:**

* Case 1 has 15 possible outcomes.
* Case 2 has 10 possible outcomes.

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

Case 1 is more likely to occur because it has more possible outcomes.
