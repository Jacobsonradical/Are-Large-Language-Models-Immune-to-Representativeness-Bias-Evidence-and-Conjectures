Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  
* So, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Then, choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted because the order we chose the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Again, we've overcounted because the order we chose the groups doesn't matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 10/729

**Conclusion:**

{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**  Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring because there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve that specific outcome.
