Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring and compare them.  The key is to realize that each ball has 3 possible destinations (child A, B, or C).

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6 balls, so we can choose 2 in  ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, so there are ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6 ways.
   3. **The remaining balls go to C:**  There's only one way to do this.

   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:**  ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:**  1 way

   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:** Each ball has 3 choices, so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible outcomes.
* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher, it will occur more often.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
