Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to compare the probability of getting two balls each for A, B, and C (case 1) versus the probability of getting two balls for A, three for B, and one for C (case 2).

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, we choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls go to C.
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups doesn't matter (ABC, ACB, etc.). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C.
    * Again, we've overcounted due to order. There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**Conclusion**

* Probability of Case 1: 15/729 
* Probability of Case 2: 10/729

**Answer:** {case: **1**} 

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
