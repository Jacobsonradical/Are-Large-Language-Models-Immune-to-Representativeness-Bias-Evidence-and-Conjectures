Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the balls are given to the children doesn't matter.  

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2** 
   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. 
   - The number of ways to do this is:  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * (2!/(2!0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.
   - The number of ways to do this is: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(3!1!)) * (1!/(1!0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Total Possible Outcomes**

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ = 729 (each ball has 3 choices).

**Probabilities**

* Probability of Case 1: 90/729 
* Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, we can expect more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
