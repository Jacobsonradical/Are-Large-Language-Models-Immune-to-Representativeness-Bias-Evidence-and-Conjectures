Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable balls:** Each ball is unique (e.g., they have different colors).
* **Random distribution:** The balls are assigned to the children randomly. 

**Calculations**

* **Total possible outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), and there are 6 balls. So, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (2 balls each):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
    *  Ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
    *  Ways to choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4): 4C2 = 6
    *  Ways to choose 2 balls for C (from the remaining 2): 2C2 = 1
    *  Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (2, 3, 1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. 
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
    * Ways to choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4): 4C3 = 4
    * Ways to choose 1 ball for C (from the remaining 1): 1C1 = 1
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Answer**

Case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2.

**Therefore, {case: 1}**
