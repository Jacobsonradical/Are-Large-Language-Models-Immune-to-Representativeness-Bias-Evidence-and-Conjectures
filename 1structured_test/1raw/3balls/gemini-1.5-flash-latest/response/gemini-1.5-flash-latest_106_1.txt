Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 possible children it can go to.
* With 6 balls, the total number of outcomes is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.  This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways.  (Using combinations)
    * ⁶C₂ = 15, ⁴C₂ = 6, ²C₂ = 1
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**3. Compare the results:**

* Case 1 has 90 outcomes.
* Case 2 has 60 outcomes.

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion:** Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
