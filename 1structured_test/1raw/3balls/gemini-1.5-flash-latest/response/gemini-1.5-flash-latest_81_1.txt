Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to compare the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.  Since the balls are distinguishable, we need to consider all possible arrangements.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Step 1: Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Step 2: Choose 2 balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways to do this (4 choose 2), which is 6.
* **Step 3: The remaining 2 balls go to C.**

To get the total number of ways for Case 1, we multiply the possibilities for each step: 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Step 1: Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to do this, which is 15.
* **Step 2: Choose 3 balls for B:** There are 4C3 ways to do this (4 choose 3), which is 4.
* **Step 3: The remaining 1 ball goes to C.**

To get the total number of ways for Case 2, we multiply: 15 * 4 = 60

**Answer**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 (90 ways) than for Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

**{case: 1}**
