Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each of the 6 balls, there are 3 children it could go to. 
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
    * This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups (A then B then C, or B then A then C, etc.) doesn't matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Actual outcomes for Case 1: 90 / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways
    * Again, we've overcounted based on the order we choose the groups (3! = 6 ways).
    * Actual outcomes for Case 2: 60 / 6 = 10

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 15 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 10 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than Case 2, there will be more results of **Case 1**.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
