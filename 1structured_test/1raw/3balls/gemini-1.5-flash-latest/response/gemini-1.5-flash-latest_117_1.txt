Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable:

* **Case 1:** Two balls for each child (A:2, B:2, C:2)
* **Case 2:** Two balls for A, three for B, and one for C (A:2, B:3, C:1)

**Calculations**

1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children.  So, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

2. **Calculating Case 1 Outcomes:**

   * **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   * **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
   * **The remaining 2 balls go to C.** 

   * **Total Case 1 Outcomes:** 15 * 6 = 90

3. **Calculating Case 2 Outcomes:**

   * **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * **The remaining 1 ball goes to C.**

   * **Total Case 2 Outcomes:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 possible outcomes.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
