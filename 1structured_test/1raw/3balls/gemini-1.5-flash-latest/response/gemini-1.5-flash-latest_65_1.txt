Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C). 
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

* We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
* This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways (using combinations), which equals 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

* We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. 
* This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways, which equals 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 90/729 
* Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, there will be **more results of Case 1**.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
