Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round of the game.  The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** There's only 1 way for this to happen.

   * **Total possibilities for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:**  ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C:** 1 way

   * **Total possibilities for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Answer:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher (90/729) than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), there will be more results of **Case 1** over many rounds.

**{case: 1}**
