Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   - We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   - The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   - However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups (A, then B, then C) doesn't matter. We've counted each arrangement 3! (3 factorial = 6) times.
   - Total ways for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   - Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   - The remaining ball goes to C.
   - Again, we've overcounted due to the order of choosing groups. We've counted each arrangement 3! (3 factorial = 6) times.
   - Total ways for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15 / (total possible ways to distribute the balls)
* **Probability of Case 2:** 10 / (total possible ways to distribute the balls)

Since the denominator (total possible ways) is the same for both cases, we can see that Case 1 is more likely because it has a higher numerator.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
