Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more probable when distributing 6 balls randomly among three children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), leading to 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 Probability:**
   - We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
   - The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
   - Probability of Case 1 = 90/729

* **Case 2 Probability:**
   - We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
   - The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60
   - Probability of Case 2 = 60/729

**Comparison**

Since 90/729 > 60/729, Case 1 is more likely than Case 2.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
