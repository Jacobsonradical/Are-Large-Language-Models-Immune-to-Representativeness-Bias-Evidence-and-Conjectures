Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more probable when randomly assigning 6 balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), giving us a total of 3^6 = 729 possible outcomes.

* **Case 1 Outcomes:** To calculate the number of ways to get case 1 (2 balls for each child), we use combinations:

    *  Choosing 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choosing 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

    * Total outcomes for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 Outcomes:** 

    * Choosing 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choosing 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

    * Total outcomes for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 outcomes for case 1 and 60 outcomes for case 2.  

**Answer:**

{case: 1}  

**Reasoning:**

Case 1 is more likely because there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve that specific arrangement.
