Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to do this (6 choose 2).
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to do this (4 balls left to choose from).
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** 1 way.

   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Calculating Probabilities (continued)**

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**The Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 (20/243) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (10/81), we expect to see **more results of Case 2** over many rounds of the game.

**{case: 2}**
