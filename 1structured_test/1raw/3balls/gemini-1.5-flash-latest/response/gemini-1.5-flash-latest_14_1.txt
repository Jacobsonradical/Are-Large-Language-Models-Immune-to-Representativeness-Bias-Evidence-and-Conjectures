Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them. The case with the higher probability will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   * **Step 1: Choose the groups.**  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways (using combinations).  
   * **Step 2: Arrange within the groups.**  The balls within each group can be arranged in 2! ways.
   * **Step 3: Total arrangements.** We multiply the possibilities from steps 1 and 2: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ * 2! * 2! * 2!  = 15 * 6 * 2 * 8 = 1440

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   * **Step 1: Choose the groups.** We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways.
   * **Step 2: Arrange within the groups.** The balls within each group can be arranged in 2! * 3! * 1! ways.
   * **Step 3: Total arrangements.** Multiply the possibilities from steps 1 and 2: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ * 2! * 3! * 1! = 15 * 4 * 1 * 12 = 720

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ = 729 (each ball has 3 options).

* **Probabilities:**
    * Probability of Case 1: 1440/729 = 16/9
    * Probability of Case 2: 720/729 = 8/9

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has a higher probability of occurring than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
