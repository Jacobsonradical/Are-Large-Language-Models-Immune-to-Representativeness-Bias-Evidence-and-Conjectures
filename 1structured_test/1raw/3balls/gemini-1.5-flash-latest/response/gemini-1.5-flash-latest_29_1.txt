Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 possible children it can go to.  
* The total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Then, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls go to child C. 
   * However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups doesn't matter (ABC, ACB, BAC, etc. are all the same outcome). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the children.
   * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining ball goes to C.
   * Again, we overcount because the order of choosing A, B, and C doesn't matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to order them.
   * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 10 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 (15/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (10/729), there will be more results of **Case 1** in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
