Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur when 6 balls are randomly assigned to three children.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Then, choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   * However, we've overcounted because we can choose the balls for A, B, and C in any order (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).  
   * Total arrangements for case 1: (15 * 6) / 3! = 15 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   * Overcounting: We can choose the balls for A, B, and C in 3! = 6 ways.
   * Total arrangements for case 2: (15 * 4) / 3! = 10 ways

**Conclusion**

Case 1 has 15 possible arrangements, while case 2 has 10. This means **case 1 is more likely to occur**.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
