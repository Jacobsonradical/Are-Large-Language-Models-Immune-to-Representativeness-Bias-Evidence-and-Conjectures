Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is 6C2 = 15 (using combinations).
    *  So, the number of ways to get Case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.  However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups (A then B then C, or B then A then C, etc.) doesn't matter. 
    * We've overcounted by a factor of 3! (3 factorial, or 3*2*1 = 6), the number of ways to order the three groups.
    *  The actual number of outcomes for Case 1 is 3375 / 6 = 562.5.  Since we can't have half an outcome, we round down to 562.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is 6C2 = 15.
    * The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 is 6C3 = 20.
    * The number of ways to choose 1 ball out of 6 is 6C1 = 6.
    * So, the number of outcomes for Case 2 is 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800.

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 562 / 729  
* **Probability of Case 2:** 1800 / 729

**Answer:**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1, we expect to see more results of Case 2 over many rounds of the game.

**{case: 2}**
