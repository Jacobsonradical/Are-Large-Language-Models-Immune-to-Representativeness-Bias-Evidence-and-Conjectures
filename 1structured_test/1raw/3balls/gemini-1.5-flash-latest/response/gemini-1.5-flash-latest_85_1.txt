Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total possible distributions:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children.  
* So, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729 possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the number of distributions for each case:**

* **Case 1:** We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    *  The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.
    * We need to do this for each child, so the total number of distributions for case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.  However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). We need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 groups, which is 3! = 6.
    *  Therefore, the actual number of distributions for case 1 is 3375 / 6 = 562.5.  Since we can't have half a distribution, we round down to 562.

* **Case 2:** We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    *  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for A.
    *  ⁶C₃ = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20 ways to choose 3 balls for B.
    *  ⁶C₁ = 6 ways to choose 1 ball for C.
    *  The total number of distributions for case 2 is 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800. 

**3. Compare the results:**

* Case 1 has 562 distributions.
* Case 2 has 1800 distributions.

**Answer:** {case: 2} 

**Conclusion:** Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more often than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
