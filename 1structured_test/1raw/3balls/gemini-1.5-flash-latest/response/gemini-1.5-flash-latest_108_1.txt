Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways we can distribute the 6 balls in each case, and then compare those numbers.  The case with more possible arrangements will be more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15 ways
   * Then we need to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = (4!)/(2!2!) = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   * Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = (4!)/(3!1!) = 4 ways
   * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

   * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Reasoning**

Case 1 has 90 possible arrangements, while Case 2 has 60. This means that Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
