Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls go to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 90/729 
* Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2,  we can conclude:

{case: 1}
