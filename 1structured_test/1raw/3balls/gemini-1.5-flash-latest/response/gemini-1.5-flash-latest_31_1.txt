Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

* **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
* **The remaining 2 balls go to C.**
* **Total outcomes for case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

* **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
* **The remaining 1 ball goes to C.**
* **Total outcomes for case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of case 1:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of case 2:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Conclusion:**

{case: 1} 

**Case 1 will occur more frequently** because it has a higher probability of occurring in any given round.
