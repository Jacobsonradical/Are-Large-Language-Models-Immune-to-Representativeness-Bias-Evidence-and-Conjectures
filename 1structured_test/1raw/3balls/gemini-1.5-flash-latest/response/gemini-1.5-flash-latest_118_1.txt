Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable when randomly distributing 6 balls among three children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time)
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B:**  ⁴C₂ = 6 
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for C:**  ²C₂ = 1
    * **Total for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15
    * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4
    * **Ways to choose 1 ball for C:** ₁C₁ = 1
    * **Total for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)** has 90 favorable outcomes.
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)** has 60 favorable outcomes.

Since Case 1 has more favorable outcomes, it's more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
