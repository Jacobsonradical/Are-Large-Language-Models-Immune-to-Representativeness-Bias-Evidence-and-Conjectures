Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable balls:** Each ball is unique (e.g., different colors).
* **Random distribution:**  Each ball has an equal chance of going to any of the three children.

**Calculations**

1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

2. **Calculating Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:**  6 choose 2 = 15 ways.
   * **Choosing 2 balls for B from the remaining:** 4 choose 2 = 6 ways. 
   * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 ways

3. **Calculating Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:** 6 choose 2 = 15 ways.
   * **Choosing 3 balls for B from the remaining:** 4 choose 3 = 4 ways.
   * **The remaining ball automatically goes to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60 ways

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to achieve Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
