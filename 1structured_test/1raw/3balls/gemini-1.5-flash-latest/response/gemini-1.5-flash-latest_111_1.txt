Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable:

* **Case 1:**  2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C.
* **Case 2:** 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

**Calculating Probabilities**

To calculate the probabilities, we'll use combinations:

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 children and 6 balls. Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1:**
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2:**
    * Ways to choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Conclusion**

Case 1, where the balls are distributed evenly (2-2-2), is more likely to occur than Case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
