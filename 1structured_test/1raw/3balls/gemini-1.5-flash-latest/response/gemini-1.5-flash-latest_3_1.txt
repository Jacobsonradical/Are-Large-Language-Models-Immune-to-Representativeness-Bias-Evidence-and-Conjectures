Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Choosing the balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
* **Choosing the balls for B:** We have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways = 6 ways.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the outcomes:**

Case 1 has 90 outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 outcomes.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}  
 
**Conclusion:** Case 1, where the balls are distributed 2-2-2, will occur more frequently than Case 2 (2-3-1).
