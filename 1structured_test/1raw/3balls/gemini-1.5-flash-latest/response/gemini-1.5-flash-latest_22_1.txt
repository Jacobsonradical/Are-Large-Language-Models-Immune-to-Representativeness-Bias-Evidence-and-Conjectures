Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each can go to one of three children. 
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
   * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the number of outcomes:**

* Case 1 has 90 outcomes.
* Case 2 has 60 outcomes.

**Answer:** {case: 1}

**Conclusion:** Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) will occur more frequently than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) because it has more possible outcomes.
