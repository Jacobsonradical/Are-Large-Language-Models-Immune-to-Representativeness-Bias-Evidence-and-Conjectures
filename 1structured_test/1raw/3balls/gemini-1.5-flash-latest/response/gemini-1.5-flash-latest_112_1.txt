Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to determine the probability of each case occurring in a single round and compare them.  The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** For each of the 6 balls, there are 3 possible children it could go to. So there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is 6C2 = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15
    * So, the total arrangements for Case 1 are 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.
    * Probability of Case 1: 3375 / 729 

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 is 6C3 = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20
    * The total arrangements for Case 2 are 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800
    * Probability of Case 2: 1800 / 729 

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
