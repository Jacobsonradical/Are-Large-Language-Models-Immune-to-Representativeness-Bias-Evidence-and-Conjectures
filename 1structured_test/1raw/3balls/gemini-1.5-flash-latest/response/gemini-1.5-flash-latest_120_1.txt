Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 possible children it can go to.  
* The total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90. 
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Case 1 probability:** 90/729 
* **Case 2 probability:** 60/729

**Answer:**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), **{case: 1}** will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
