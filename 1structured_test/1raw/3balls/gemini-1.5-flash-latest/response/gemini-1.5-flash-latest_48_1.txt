Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round.  The case with the higher probability is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). Since there are 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    * **Choosing the balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6, which can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    * **Choosing the balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, so we choose 2 in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    * **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 

    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    * **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Case 1 has a higher probability than Case 2.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
