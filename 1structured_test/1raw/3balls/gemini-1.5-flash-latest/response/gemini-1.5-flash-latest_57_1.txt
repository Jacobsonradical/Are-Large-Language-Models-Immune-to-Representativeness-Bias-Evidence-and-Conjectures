Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children. 
* So, there are 3 possibilities for the first ball, 3 for the second, and so on.
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

* **Choosing the balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Choosing the balls for B:** We have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

* **Choosing the balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 = 20/243

**Conclusion:**

The probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1. 

**Answer: {case: 2}**
