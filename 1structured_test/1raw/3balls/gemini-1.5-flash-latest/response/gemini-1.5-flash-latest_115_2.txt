Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable:

* **Case 1:** Two balls for each child (A:2, B:2, C:2)
* **Case 2:** Two balls for one child, three for another, and one for the last (A:2, B:3, C:1)

**Calculations**

1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 children and 6 balls. Each ball can go to one of three children. So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729.

2. **Case 1 Outcomes:**
   *  Let's pick two balls for A. There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to do this (6 choose 2).
   *  For B, we have ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   *  For C, the remaining two balls go automatically to C.
   *  Therefore, the total outcomes for Case 1 are 15 * 6 = 90.

3. **Case 2 Outcomes:**
   *  Let's pick two balls for A. There are ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to do this.
   *  For B, we need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4. There are ⁴C₃ = 4 ways to do this.
   *  The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   *  However, we need to account for the fact that the 'special' child (with 3 balls) could be A, B, or C. So, we multiply our result by 3.
   *  Therefore, the total outcomes for Case 2 are 15 * 4 * 3 = 180.

**Conclusion**

* **Case 1:** 90 outcomes
* **Case 2:** 180 outcomes

**Answer:** {case: 2}

**Reason:** Case 2 has twice as many possible outcomes as Case 1, making it more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
