Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**

* We have 6 balls and 3 children. Each ball can go to one of three children.
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3⁶ = 729

**2. Calculate the Probability of Each Case**

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

* **Step 1:** Choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Step 2:** Choose 2 balls for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways (4 balls remain after choosing for A)
* **Step 3:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
* **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90
* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

* **Step 1:** Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Step 2:** Choose 3 balls for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways (4 balls remain after choosing for A)
* **Step 3:** The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**3. Compare the Probabilities**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
