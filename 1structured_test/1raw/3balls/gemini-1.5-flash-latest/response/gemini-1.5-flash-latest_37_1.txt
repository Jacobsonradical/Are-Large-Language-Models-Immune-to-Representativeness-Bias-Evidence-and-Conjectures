Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable balls:** Each ball is unique, so we care about which specific balls each child receives.
* **Random distribution:**  Each ball has an equal chance of going to any of the three children.

**Calculations**

* **Total possible outcomes:** For each ball, there are 3 possible children it can go to. With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways (where  ⁶C₂ is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6, etc.).  This simplifies to 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways, which simplifies to 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), we expect to see **more results of Case 1** in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
