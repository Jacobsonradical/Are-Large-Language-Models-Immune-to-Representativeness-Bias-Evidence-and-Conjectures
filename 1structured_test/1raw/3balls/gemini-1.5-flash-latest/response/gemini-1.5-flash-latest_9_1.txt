Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C2 = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C automatically.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 90 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), there will be **more results of Case 1** in many rounds of the game.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
