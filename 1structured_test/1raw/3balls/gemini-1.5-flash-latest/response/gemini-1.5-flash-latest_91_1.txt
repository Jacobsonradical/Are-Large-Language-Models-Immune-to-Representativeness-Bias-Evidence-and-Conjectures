Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability is the one we expect to see more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   - **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
   - **Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₂ = 6 (4 choose 2)
   - **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   - **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
   - **Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₃ = 4 (4 choose 3)
   - **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**
   - **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

* **Total possible arrangements:**  Each ball can go to one of three children, so there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729  ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Reasoning**

Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring in a single round of the game because there are more ways to distribute the balls with an even split (2-2-2) compared to the distribution in Case 2 (2-3-1).  Therefore, over many rounds, we would expect to see more results matching Case 1.
