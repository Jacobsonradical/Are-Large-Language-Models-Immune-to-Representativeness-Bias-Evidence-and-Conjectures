Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* There are 6 balls, so the total number of possible outcomes is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Conclusion:**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has a higher probability of occurring than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). 

**Answer:** {case: 1}
