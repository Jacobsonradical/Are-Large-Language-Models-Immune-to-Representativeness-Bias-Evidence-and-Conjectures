Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them. The case with the higher probability will be more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C).  Therefore, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
