Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more likely to occur when 6 balls are randomly assigned to 3 children. 

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   -  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest automatically go to C.
   -  The number of ways to do this is:  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ = 15 * 6 = 90 

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest automatically go to C.
   - The number of ways to do this is: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ = 15 * 4 = 60

**Total Possible Outcomes**

- Each ball has 3 possible destinations (A, B, or C).
- The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls is 3⁶ = 729

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729  ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 ≈ 0.082

**Conclusion**

Case 1 is more likely to occur than Case 2.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
