Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to determine the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with the higher probability is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  Since there are 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) ways, which equals 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729 = 10/81

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) ways, which equals 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729 = 20/243

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 (20/243) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (10/81), over many rounds there will be more results of **Case 2**.

**{case: 2}**
