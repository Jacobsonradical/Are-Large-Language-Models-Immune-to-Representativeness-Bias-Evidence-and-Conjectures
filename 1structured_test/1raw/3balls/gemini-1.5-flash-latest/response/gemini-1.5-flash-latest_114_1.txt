Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening.  Since the balls are distinguishable, we need to consider the different ways the balls can be assigned to each child.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₂ = 6
    * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C**

    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

    * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15
    * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4:** ⁴C₃ = 4
    * **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C**

    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Total possible arrangements for distributing 6 balls:**  3⁶ = 729 (Each ball has 3 choices: A, B, or C).

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Reasoning:**

Case 1 has a higher probability of occurring than Case 2 because there are more ways to arrange the balls to satisfy the conditions of Case 1.
