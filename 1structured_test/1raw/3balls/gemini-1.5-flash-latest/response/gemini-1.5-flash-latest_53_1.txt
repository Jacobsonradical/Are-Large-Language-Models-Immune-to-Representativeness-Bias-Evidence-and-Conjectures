Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* For each ball, there are 3 children it could go to.
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1:** 
    *  Choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls go to C.
    *  Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90
* **Case 2:**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* Probability of Case 2: 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Conclusion:**

{case: 1}

Case 1 will occur more often because it has a higher probability of occurring.
