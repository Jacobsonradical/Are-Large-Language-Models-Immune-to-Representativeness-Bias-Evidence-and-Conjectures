Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

*  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). 
*  With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  
    * The number of ways to do this is: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to do this is: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer:**

{case: **1**} 

**Reasoning:** 
Case 1 is more likely because it has a higher probability of occurring. There are more ways to distribute the balls evenly (2 for each child) than to have one child with 3 balls, another with 2, and the last with only 1.
