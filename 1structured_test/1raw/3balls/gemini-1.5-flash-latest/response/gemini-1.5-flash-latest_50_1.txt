Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children. 
* So, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   * Then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
   * The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   *  Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   * The remaining ball goes to C.
   * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), there will be more results of **Case 1** in many rounds of the game.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
