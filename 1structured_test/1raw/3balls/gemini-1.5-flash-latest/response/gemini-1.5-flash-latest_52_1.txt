Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the Total Number of Possibilities**

* We have 6 balls and 3 children.  Each ball has 3 options (A, B, or C).
* Total possible distributions: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the Possibilities for Each Case**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C2 = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total possibilities for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total possibilities for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), we can conclude:

{case: 1}
