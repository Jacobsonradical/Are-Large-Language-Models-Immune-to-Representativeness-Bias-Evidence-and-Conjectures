Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more probable when we randomly assign 6 balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), giving us a total of 3^6 = 729 possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  We then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    *  However, we've overcounted since we could have chosen the balls for A, B, and C in any order (3! = 6 ways).
    *  Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 1 is (15 * 6) / 6 = 15.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Again, we've overcounted due to the order we chose the balls (3! = 6 ways).
    * Therefore, the number of outcomes for case 2 is (15 * 4) / 6 = 10.

**Conclusion**

Since case 1 has 15 possible outcomes and case 2 has 10 possible outcomes, case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
