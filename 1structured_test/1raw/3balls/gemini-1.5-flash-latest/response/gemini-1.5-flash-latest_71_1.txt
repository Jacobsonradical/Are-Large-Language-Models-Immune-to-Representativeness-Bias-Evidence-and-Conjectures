Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur when randomly assigning 6 balls to 3 children.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   -  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the rest go to child C. 
   -  This can be calculated using combinations: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90
   -  To get the total number of ways to distribute the balls, we need to consider all possible arrangements, which is 6! (6 factorial) = 720
   -  Probability of Case 1: 90 / 720 = 1/8

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 for C.
   - Combinations: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60
   - Probability of Case 2: 60 / 720 = 1/12

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 (1/8) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (1/12), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
