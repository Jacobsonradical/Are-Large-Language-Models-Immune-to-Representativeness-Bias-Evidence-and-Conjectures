Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the balls are given to the children doesn't matter.  

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 3 children and 6 balls.  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
    * Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C automatically.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 has 60.  Therefore, Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
