Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
