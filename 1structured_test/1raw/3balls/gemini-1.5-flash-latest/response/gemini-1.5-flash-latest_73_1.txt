Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   - **Step 1: Choose 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
   - **Step 2: Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   - **Step 3: The remaining 2 balls go to C.**

   - **Total possibilities for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - **Step 1: Choose 2 balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   - **Step 2: Choose 3 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   - **Step 3: The remaining ball goes to C.**

   - **Total possibilities for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Total Possible Outcomes**

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ (each ball has 3 choices).

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 3⁶ = 5/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 3⁶ = 10/243

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 (10/243) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (5/81), **Case 2 will occur more frequently.**

**Therefore, the answer is: {case: 2}**
