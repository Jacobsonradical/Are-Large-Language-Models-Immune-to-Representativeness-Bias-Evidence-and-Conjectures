Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children. So, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90/729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60/729 = 20/243

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1, there will be more results of **Case 2**.

**Answer: {case: 2}**
