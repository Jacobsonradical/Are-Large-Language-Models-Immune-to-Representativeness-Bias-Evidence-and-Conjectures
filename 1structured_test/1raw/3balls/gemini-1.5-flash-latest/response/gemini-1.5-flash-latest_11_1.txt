Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable:

* **Case 1:**  Two balls go to each child (A, B, and C).
* **Case 2:** Two balls go to A, three to B, and one to C.

**Calculating Probabilities**

1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

2. **Calculating Probability of Case 1:**

   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
   * **Choosing 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4.
   * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

   * **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729

3. **Calculating Probability of Case 2:**

   * **Choosing 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * **Choosing 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways 
   * **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

   * **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
