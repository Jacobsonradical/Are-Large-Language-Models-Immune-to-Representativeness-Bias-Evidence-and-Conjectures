Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children. 
* Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Choosing the balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Choosing the balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 
* **Total outcomes for case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
* **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total outcomes for case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of case 2:** 60 / 729

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, we can conclude:

**{case: 1}**
