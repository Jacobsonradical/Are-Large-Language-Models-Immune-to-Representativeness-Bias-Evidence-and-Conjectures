Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations because the order in which the balls are given to the children doesn't matter.  

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**

   * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Then, choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls go to C.
   * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**

   * Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
   * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing Probabilities**

* There are 90 ways to achieve Case 1.
* There are 60 ways to achieve Case 2.

**Answer**

Since there are more ways to achieve Case 1, it will occur more frequently.

**{case: 1}**
