Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. 
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is 6C2 = 15. 
    * So, for case 1, there are 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 ways to arrange the balls.  However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups of 2 doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups, so we divide by 6.
    * Case 1 outcomes: 3375 / 6 = 562.5

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball goes to C automatically.
    * Case 2 outcomes: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the outcomes:**

Case 1 has 562.5 outcomes, while case 2 has 60 outcomes.

**Answer:** {case: 1} 

**Conclusion:** Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is significantly more likely to occur than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
