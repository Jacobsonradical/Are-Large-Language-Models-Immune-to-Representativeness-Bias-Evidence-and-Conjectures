Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring.  The probability is determined by the number of ways each case can happen divided by the total number of possible ways to distribute the balls.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Distributions:**  Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
    * The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is 6C2 = 15 (using combinations).
    * So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375. 
    * Probability of Case 1: 3375 / 729  ≈ 4.63

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729 ≈ 0.08

**Conclusion**

{case: 1} 

Case 1 is significantly more likely than Case 2 because there are many more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.
