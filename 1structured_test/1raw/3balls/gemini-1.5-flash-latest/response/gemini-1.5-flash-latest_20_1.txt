Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the balls:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* There are 6 balls, so the total number of distributions is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729.

**2. Calculate the number of ways for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 90 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 60 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Case 1 is more likely to occur.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
