Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes**

*  We have 6 balls and 3 children. Each ball can go to any of the 3 children.
*  Total possible outcomes: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case**

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Choosing the balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
* **Choosing the balls for B:** We have 4 balls left and need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Choosing the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
* **Choosing the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
* **Choosing the balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
* **Total outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**3. Compare the probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
