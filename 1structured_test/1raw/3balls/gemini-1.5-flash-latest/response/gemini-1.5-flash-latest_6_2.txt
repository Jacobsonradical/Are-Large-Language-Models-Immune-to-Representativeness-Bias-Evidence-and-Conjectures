Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes**

* There are 6 balls, and each ball can go to one of three children.  So there are 3 options for each ball, giving us a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the outcomes for each case**

* **Case 1:**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.  (⁶C₂ means 6 choose 2, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 6).
* **Case 2:**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

**3. Compare the probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, we can conclude:

**{case: 1}**
