Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them.  The case with the higher probability will be more likely to occur in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), and we have 6 balls. So the total number of possible outcomes is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
    * The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90. 
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
    * The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
