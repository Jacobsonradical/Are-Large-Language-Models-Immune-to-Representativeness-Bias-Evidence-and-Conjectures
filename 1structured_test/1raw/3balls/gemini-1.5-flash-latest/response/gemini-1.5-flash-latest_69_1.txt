Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur when randomly distributing 6 balls among 3 children.  

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, then 2 for B (the rest automatically go to C).
    * Combinations for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Combinations for B: 4C2 = 6 ways 
    * Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
    * Combinations for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Combinations for B: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing the Results**

Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.

**Answer**

{case: 1}  Case 1 is more likely to occur.
