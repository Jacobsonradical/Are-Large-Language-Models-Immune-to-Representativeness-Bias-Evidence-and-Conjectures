Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to do this (6 choose 2).
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways left to choose 2 balls for B (4 balls remaining).
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** There's only 1 way to do this.
   4. **Total possibilities for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** 1 way.
   4. **Total possibilities for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Total possible distributions:**  The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ = 729 (each ball has 3 choices).

**Probability:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

The probability of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
