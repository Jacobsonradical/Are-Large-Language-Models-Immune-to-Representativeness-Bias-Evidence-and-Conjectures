Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round and compare them.  The case with a higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total possible outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A (⁶C₂ = 15 ways), 2 for B (⁴C₂ = 6 ways), and the remaining 2 for C.  
    * However, we've overcounted since the order we choose the groups doesn't matter (ABC is the same as CAB). We divide by 3! (3 factorial) to correct for this overcounting.
    * Total ways for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 3! = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A (⁶C₂ = 15 ways)
    * Choose 3 balls for B (⁴C₃ = 4 ways)
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 is much higher than the probability of Case 1, we can conclude:

{case: **2**}
