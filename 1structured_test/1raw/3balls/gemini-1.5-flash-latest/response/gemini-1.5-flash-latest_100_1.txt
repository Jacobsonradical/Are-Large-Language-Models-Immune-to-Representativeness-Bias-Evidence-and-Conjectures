Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total possible outcomes:**

* Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

**2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   * We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Then, 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   * However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the balls doesn't matter. We've counted each combination 3! (3*2*1 = 6) times.
   * Total outcomes for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   * Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   * Again, we've overcounted due to order. We've counted each combination 2! (2*1 = 2) times.
   * Total outcomes for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 2 = 30

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* Probability of Case 1: 15 / 729 
* Probability of Case 2: 30 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has a higher probability of occurring than Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
