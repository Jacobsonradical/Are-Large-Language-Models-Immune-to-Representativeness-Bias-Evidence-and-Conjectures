Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). Since there are 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 Probability:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729 

* **Case 2 Probability:**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Conclusion**

Case 1 has a higher probability (90/729) than Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
