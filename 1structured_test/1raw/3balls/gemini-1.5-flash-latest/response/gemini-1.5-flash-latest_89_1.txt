Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with the higher probability will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are  ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2) to do this, which is 6.
   3. **The remaining balls go to C:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   * Total possibilities for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:**  1 way.

   * Total possibilities for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Total possible distributions:** The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3⁶ (each ball has 3 choices), which is 729.

* **Probabilities:**

   * Probability of Case 1: 90/729 
   * Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2,  **{case: 1}** will occur more frequently over many rounds.
