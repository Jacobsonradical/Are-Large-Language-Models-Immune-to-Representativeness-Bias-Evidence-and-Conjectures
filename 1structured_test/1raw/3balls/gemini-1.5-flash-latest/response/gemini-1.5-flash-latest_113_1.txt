Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round. The case with the higher probability is the one that will occur more often over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining:** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways (4 choose 2)
   * **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 ways

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   * **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   * **Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways (4 choose 3)
   * **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**
   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60 ways

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total possible ways to distribute the balls:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). So, there are 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**The Answer**

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher (20/243 > 10/81), **{case: 2}** will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
