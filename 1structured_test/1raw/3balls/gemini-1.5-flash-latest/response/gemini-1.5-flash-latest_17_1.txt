Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We have 6 distinct balls, so each ball has 3 possible destinations (child A, B, or C).
* We need to figure out how many ways each case can occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2** 

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways (4 remaining balls choose 2)
   3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

   * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways (4 remaining balls choose 3)
   3. **The remaining ball automatically goes to C.**

   * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Explanation**

Case 1 has more possible combinations (90) than Case 2 (60).  Therefore, in many rounds of the game, you're more likely to see the distribution of Case 1.
