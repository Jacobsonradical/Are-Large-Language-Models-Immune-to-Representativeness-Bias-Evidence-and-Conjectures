Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable Balls:** Each ball is unique (e.g., different colors).
* **Random Distribution:**  The balls are assigned to children randomly.

**Calculating Probabilities**

To find out which case is more likely, we'll calculate the probability of each case occurring.

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). Since there are 6 balls, the total number of possible outcomes is 3^6 = 729.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time)
* **Ways to choose 2 balls for B:**  ⁴C₂ = 6 (combinations of the remaining 4 balls taken 2 at a time)
* **Ways to choose 2 balls for C:**  ²C₂ = 1 (the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C)

* **Total Outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Ways to choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15
* **Ways to choose 3 balls for B:**  ⁴C₃ = 4
* **Ways to choose 1 ball for C:**  ¹C₁ = 1

* **Total Outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

The probability of Case 2 (20/243) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (10/81). 

**Answer:** {case: 2}
