Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the total number of possible distributions:**

*  For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
*  With 6 balls, there are 3^6 = 729 total possible distributions.

**2. Calculate the number of distributions for each case:**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.
   *  This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways. 
   *  However, we've overcounted because the order we choose the groups (A then B then C) doesn't matter. There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
   *  Therefore, the actual number of distributions for Case 1 is 90 / 6 = 15.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   *  We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.
   *  This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.
   *  Similar to Case 1, we've overcounted because the order of choosing the groups doesn't matter.
   *  Therefore, the actual number of distributions for Case 2 is 60 / 3! = 60/6 = 10.

**3. Compare the probabilities:**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 15 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 10 / 729

**Conclusion:**

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, there will be more results of **{case: 1}** in many rounds of the game.
