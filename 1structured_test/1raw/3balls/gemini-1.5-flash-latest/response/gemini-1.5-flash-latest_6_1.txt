Here's how to determine which case will occur more frequently:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable balls:**  Each ball is unique (e.g., different colors). This means swapping two balls within a child's possession counts as a different outcome.
* **Random distribution:**  Each ball has an equal chance of going to any of the three children.

**Calculating Probabilities**

To compare the cases, we'll calculate the probability of each case occurring in a single round.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. **Choosing balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
2. **Choosing balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, and need to choose 2. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
4. **Arrangements:**  The order in which the children receive their balls matters (e.g., A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is different from getting ball 2 then ball 1). We need to account for the permutations of balls within each child's set. There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange 2 balls, and we have this for each child.

**Total Arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 2! * 2! * 2! = 720

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. **Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways 
3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
4. **Arrangements:** We have 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the 3 balls for B and 2! ways to arrange the 2 balls for A.

**Total Arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 3! * 2! = 720

**Finding the Probabilities**

* **Total possible outcomes:**  Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (A, B, or C), giving us 3⁶ = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Probability of Case 1:** 720 / 729 
* **Probability of Case 2:** 720 / 729

**Answer:**

Both Case 1 and Case 2 have the same probability of occurring. 

**{case: Neither, they are equally likely}**
