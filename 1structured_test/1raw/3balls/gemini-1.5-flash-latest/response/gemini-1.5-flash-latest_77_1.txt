Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round of the game. The case with the higher probability will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   1. **Choose the balls for A:**  There are  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. 
   2. **Choose the balls for B:** There are ⁴C₂ = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
   3. **The remaining balls go to C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
   4. **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   1. **Choose the balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose the balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** There's only 1 way to do this.
   4. **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

* **Total possible arrangements:**  To calculate the total number of ways to distribute the balls, we can think of each ball having 3 choices (A, B, or C).  This gives us 3⁶ = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Probabilities:**
   *  Probability of Case 1: 90/729 
   *  Probability of Case 2: 60/729

**Answer**

Since the probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729), we expect to see **more results of Case 1** over many rounds of the game.

**Therefore, the answer is: {case: 1}**
