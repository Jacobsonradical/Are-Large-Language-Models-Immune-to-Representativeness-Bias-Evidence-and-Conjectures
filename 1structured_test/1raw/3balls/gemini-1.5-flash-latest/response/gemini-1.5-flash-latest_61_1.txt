Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**1. Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes**

* For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C).
* Since there are 6 balls, the total number of possible outcomes is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729

**2. Calculate the Number of Outcomes for Each Case**

* **Case 1:** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in  ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ ways. 
    * ⁶C₂ = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
    * ⁴C₂ = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6
    * ²C₂ = 2! / (2! * 0!) = 1
    * Total outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2:**
    * Choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ ways.
    * ⁶C₂ = 15 (calculated above)
    * ⁴C₃ = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
    * ¹C₁ = 1! / (1! * 0!) = 1
    * Total outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**3. Compare the Probabilities**

* **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 10/81
* **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is more likely to occur than Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Answer:** {case: 2}
