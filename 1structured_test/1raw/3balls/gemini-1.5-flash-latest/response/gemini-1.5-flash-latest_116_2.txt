Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case happening in a single round and compare them. The case with the higher probability will occur more frequently over many rounds.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

   - We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Then, we choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   - The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
   - However, we've overcounted since the order we chose the groups doesn't matter (A then B then C is the same as B then C then A).  We need to divide by 3! (3 factorial, the number of ways to order 3 groups).
   - Total possibilities for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 3! = 15

* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

   - Choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   - Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   - The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
   - Again, we need to divide by 3! to avoid overcounting.
   - Total possibilities for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 3! = 10

**Comparing Probabilities**

- **Case 1:** 15 possibilities
- **Case 2:** 10 possibilities

**Answer**

Since there are more possibilities for Case 1, it's more likely to occur in a single round. 

**Therefore, the answer is: {case: 1}**
