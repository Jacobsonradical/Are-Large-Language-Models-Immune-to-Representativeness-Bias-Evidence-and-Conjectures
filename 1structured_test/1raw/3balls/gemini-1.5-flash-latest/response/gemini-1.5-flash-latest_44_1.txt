Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out the probability of each case occurring in a single round. The case with the higher probability will be the one that occurs more often over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  There are 3 choices for each of the 6 balls (A, B, or C), so the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3^6 = 729.

* **Case 1 Probability:** 
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.  This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.
    * Probability of Case 1: 90/729 = 10/81

* **Case 2 Probability:**
    * We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.  This can be done in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.
    * Probability of Case 2: 60/729 = 20/243

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 2 (20/243) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (10/81), there will be more results of **Case 2** over many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 2}
