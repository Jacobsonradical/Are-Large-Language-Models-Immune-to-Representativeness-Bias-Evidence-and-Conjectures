Here's how to figure out which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Distinguishable balls:**  Each ball is unique (e.g., they might be different colors).
* **Random distribution:**  Each ball has an equal chance of going to any of the three children.

**Calculating Probabilities**

We'll use combinations to calculate the probabilities:

* **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
    *  How many ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = 15
    *  How many ways to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = 6
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    *  Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90
* **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
    *  How many ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15
    *  How many ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₃ = 4
    *  The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    *  Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Total Possible Outcomes**

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is: ₃⁶ = 729 (each ball has 3 choices).

**Probabilities**

* Probability of Case 1: 90/729 ≈ 0.123
* Probability of Case 2: 60/729 ≈ 0.082

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Reasoning**

Case 1 is more likely because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.  This makes intuitive sense; there are more ways to divide a group into equal parts than into unequal parts.
