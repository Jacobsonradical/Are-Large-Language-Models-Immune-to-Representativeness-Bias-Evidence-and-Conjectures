To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probabilities of each distribution occurring. 

We have 6 distinguishable balls and three distinguishable children (A, B, C).

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The last 2 balls go to C automatically.

The total number of ways to assign the balls in the pattern 2-2-2:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The last 1 ball goes to C automatically.

The total number of ways to assign the balls in the pattern 2-3-1:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60
\]

### Total Number of Distributions

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children is \(3^6\), since each of the 6 balls can be given to any of the 3 children.

\[
3^6 = 729
\]

### Probability of Each Case

Using the numbers of favorable outcomes for each case, we can find the probabilities:

- Probability of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):

\[
\frac{90}{729}
\]

- Probability of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):

\[
\frac{60}{729}
\]

### Comparison

The probability for case 1 (2-2-2) is higher than the probability for case 2 (2-3-1), since 90 is greater than 60.

Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results corresponding to case 1 than to case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
