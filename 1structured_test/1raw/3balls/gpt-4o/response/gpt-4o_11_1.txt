To determine which distribution case is more likely, we need to calculate the total number of ways to achieve each distribution configuration. 

Given:
- 6 distinguishable balls being distributed among 3 children: A, B, and C

**Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, C has 2 balls**

1. Total number of combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. After choosing 2 balls for A, 4 balls remain. Total number of combinations of 4 balls taken 2 at a time for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The 2 remaining balls are automatically assigned to child C.

\[
\text{Number of ways for case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating the values:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

\[
\text{Number of ways for case 1} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, C has 1 ball**

1. Total number of combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. After choosing 2 balls for A, 4 balls remain. Total number of combinations of 4 balls taken 3 at a time for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The 1 remaining ball is automatically assigned to child C.

\[
\text{Number of ways for case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating the values:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = 4
\]

\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

\[
\text{Number of ways for case 2} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Conclusion: 
\[
\text{Comparison of the number of ways:}
\]
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

\[
\{case: 1\}
