To determine which case is more likely, we need to compute the number of possible distributions for each of the cases.

We start by computing the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children:

\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

This is because each of the 6 balls can go to any of the 3 children.

Next, we'll compute the number of ways to achieve each distribution scenario.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to go to child B:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]

3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C:
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to go to child B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C:
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion:

The number of distributions for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is 90, while for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) it is 60.

Hence, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
