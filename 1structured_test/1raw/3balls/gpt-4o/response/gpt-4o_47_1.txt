To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the total number of distributions for each case.
Let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children in these two specific cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we are distributing the 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be determined as follows:
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways for this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2}  = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we are distributing the 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this can be calculated as follows:
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The total number of ways for this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
We have:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

So, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.
