Let's compute the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) in the two given cases.

### Case 1: Distribution (2, 2, 2)
All three children must each get exactly 2 balls.

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \text{ ways}
\]

Next, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \text{ ways}
\]

The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

### Case 2: Distribution (2, 3, 1)
Child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \text{ ways}
\]

Next, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ ways}
\]

The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

### Conclusion

There are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (2, 2, 2) than in case 2 (2, 3, 1).

\[
\boxed{\{case: 1\}}
\]
