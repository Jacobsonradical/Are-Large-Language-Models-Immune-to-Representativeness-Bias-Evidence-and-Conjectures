To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

First, the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is \(3^6\) because each ball can go to any of the 3 children.

\[
3^6 = 729
\]

For case 1, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 2 balls each to A, B, and C. This can be computed using multinomial coefficients:

\[
\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6! = 720
\]
\[
2! = 2 \quad \text{(so, } 2!2!2! = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\text{)}
\]
\[
\frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

So there are 90 ways for this specific distribution.

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

For case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. This is again a multinomial coefficient:

\[
\frac{6!}{2!3!1!}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6! = 720
\]
\[
3! = 6 \quad \text{(so, } 2!3!1! = 2 \times 6 \times 1 = 12\text{)}
\]
\[
\frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Thus, there are 60 ways for this specific distribution.

**Comparing the Results:**

- Number of ways for Case 1: \(90\)
- Number of ways for Case 2: \(60\)

Therefore, there are more ways to achieve Case 1 than Case 2.

So the answer is:

\{
    case: 1
\}
