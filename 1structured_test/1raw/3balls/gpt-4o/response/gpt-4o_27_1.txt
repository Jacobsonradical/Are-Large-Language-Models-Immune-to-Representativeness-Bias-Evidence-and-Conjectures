We'll start by calculating the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case.

First, the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is \(3^6\).

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

To calculate how many ways there are to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to go to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The last 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

So the calculation becomes:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

To calculate how many ways there are to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball, we:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to go to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The last ball will automatically go to child C.

So the calculation becomes:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

From the above calculations, we can see that case 1 has 90 ways and case 2 has 60 ways.

Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
