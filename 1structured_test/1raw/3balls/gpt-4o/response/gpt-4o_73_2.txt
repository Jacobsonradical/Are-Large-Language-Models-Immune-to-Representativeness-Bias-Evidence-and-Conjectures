To determine whether case 1 or case 2 is more likely, we need to calculate the total number of ways the balls can be distributed according to each case.

**Case 1:** A:2, B:2, C:2
**Case 2:** A:2, B:3, C:1

We'll use combinations and permutations to count the number of ways each distribution can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 to give to B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 to give to B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
