To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur using combinatorial methods.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C. This can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways, which is 1 way.

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C. This can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways, which is 1 way.

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the results:
- Number of ways for Case 1: 90
- Number of ways for Case 2: 60

There are more ways for the balls to be distributed as described in Case 1 compared to Case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

### Final Answer:
{case: 1}
