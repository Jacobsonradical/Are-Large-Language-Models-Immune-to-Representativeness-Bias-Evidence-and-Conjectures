To determine which case will be more frequent, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur. 

First, let's recount the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. Each ball can go to any of the 3 children, so there are:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]
possible ways in total.

Next, let's compute the number of ways for each specific case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A. This can be done in:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \] ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \] ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A. This can be done in:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \] ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Thus, in many rounds of the game, since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{case: 1}
