To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in a large number of rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each distribution can occur. 

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A.
   - The number of ways this can be done is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\).
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. Next, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B.
   - The number of ways this can be done is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C. 

   - Since A, B, C are distinguishable, the above counts as a single unique distribution.
   - Total for case 1: \(15 \times 6 = 90\)

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A.
   - The number of ways this can be done is \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).

2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B.
   - The number of ways this can be done is \(\binom{4}{3}\) (which is the same as \(\binom{4}{1}\)).
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]

3. The remaining ball goes to C.

   - Total for case 2: \(15 \times 4 = 60\)

### Conclusion

Comparing the total number of ways for each case:
- Case 1 has \(90\) ways.
- Case 2 has \(60\) ways.

Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than of Case 2.

\(\boxed{1}\)
