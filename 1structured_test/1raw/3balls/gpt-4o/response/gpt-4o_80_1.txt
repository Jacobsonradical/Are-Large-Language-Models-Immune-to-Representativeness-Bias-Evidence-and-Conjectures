To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we should calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The last 2 balls go to child C, which is \(\binom{2}{2}\), but it's just 1 way to assign them.

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 \]
\[ = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) (which is equivalent to \(\binom{4}{1}\))
3. The last 1 ball goes to child C, which is \(\binom{1}{1}\), but it's just 1 way to assign them.

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 \]
\[ = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more results corresponding to case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
