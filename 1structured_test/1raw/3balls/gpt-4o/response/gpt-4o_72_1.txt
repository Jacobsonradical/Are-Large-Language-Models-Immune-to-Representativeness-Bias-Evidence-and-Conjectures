To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to analyze the combinatorial probabilities of each scenario.

Firstly, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, A, B, and C. Each ball has 3 possible choices, so there are:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]
total distributions.

### Case 1: Distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2

To find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \({6 \choose 2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \({4 \choose 2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\)
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to child C: \({2 \choose 2} = 1\)

So the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: Distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1

To find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \({6 \choose 2} = 15\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \({4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4\)
3. The last 1 ball automatically goes to child C: \({1 \choose 1} = 1\)

So the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case: 1} \} \]
