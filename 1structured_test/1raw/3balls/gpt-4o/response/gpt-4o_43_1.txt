To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls: 
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
   \]
2. Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
   \]
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]
2. Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has \(90\) ways.
- Case 2 has \(60\) ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**
\{case: 1\}
