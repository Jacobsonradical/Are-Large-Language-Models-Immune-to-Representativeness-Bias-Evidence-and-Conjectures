To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, according to the distributions given.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

The number of ways to divide 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 balls each can be computed as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball is:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The last 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

Using the combination formula, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4}{1} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Hence, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

Therefore, the answer to which case will occur more frequently is:
{case: 1}
