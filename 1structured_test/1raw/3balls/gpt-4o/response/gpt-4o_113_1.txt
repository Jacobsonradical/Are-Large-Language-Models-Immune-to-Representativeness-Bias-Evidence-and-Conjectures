To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be determined by combinatorial calculations.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]

3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C:
   \[
   \binom{2}{2} = 1
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C:
   \[
   \binom{1}{1} = 1
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Comparing the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Since \(90 > 60\), there will be more results of case 1 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
