To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution (case 1 and case 2) can occur.

**Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls**

The total number of balls is 6. We choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. 

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 4!} = 15 \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. We choose 2 out of these 4 balls for B:

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = 6 \]

The remaining 2 balls go to C, and there's only 1 way to do that. So the total number of ways for case 1 is:

\[ 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball**

Again, we start by choosing 2 balls for A:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

Next, from the remaining 4 balls, we choose 3 balls for B:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1!} = 4 \]

The remaining 1 ball goes to C, and there's only 1 way to do that. So the total number of ways for case 2 is:

\[ 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases, 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, it is clear that case 1 occurs more often.

Thus, the answer is:

\[ \{ \text{case: 1} \} \]
