To determine which case will appear more frequently after many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur. 

### Total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children:

Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C), so the total ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls is:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
   \[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B:
   \[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]
3. The remaining 2 balls will go to C:
   (This doesn't need any further combinations since all balls are already chosen for A and B)

So, the number of ways for Case 1:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
   \[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B:
   \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3. The remaining 1 ball will go to C:
   (Again, this doesn't need any further combinations since there's only 1 ball left)

So, the number of ways for Case 2:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur:
- Case 1 occurs in 90 ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will appear more frequently than Case 2.
