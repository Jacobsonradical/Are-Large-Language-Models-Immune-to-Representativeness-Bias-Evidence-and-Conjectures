To determine which case will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can arise. 

We'll use combinatorial methods to count the number of distributions for each case. 

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

So the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \]
\[ = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \]
\[ = 90 \]

However, this counts each distribution of A, B, and C twice because the groupings are indistinguishable (i.e., (A:2, B:2, C:2) is the same as (A:2, C:2, B:2), etc.). Therefore, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the three groups which is \(3!\).

\[ \frac{90}{3!} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) 
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C.

So the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} \]
\[ = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \]
\[ = 60 \]

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur:

- Number of ways for Case 1: 15
- Number of ways for Case 2: 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 over many rounds of the game.

**Answer**: {case: 2}
