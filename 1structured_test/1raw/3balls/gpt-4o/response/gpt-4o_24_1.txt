To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur using combinatorial methods.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Select 2 out of 6 balls to go to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

\[ 
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating the combinations:
\[ 
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \\
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \\
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 
\]

Thus:
\[ 
\text{Number of ways for Case 1} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Select 2 out of 6 balls to go to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

\[ 
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating the combinations:
\[ 
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4 \quad (\text{since } \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}) \\
\binom{1}{1} = 1 
\]

Thus:
\[ 
\text{Number of ways for Case 2} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 
\]

### Conclusion

Comparing the results:
- Number of ways for Case 1: 90
- Number of ways for Case 2: 60

Therefore, Case 1 is more likely to occur than Case 2.
