To determine which case is more likely, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur. We can do this using combinatorial methods.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. After selecting 2 balls for A, select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. This is only one way (\( \binom{2}{2} \)).

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. After selecting 2 balls for A, select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. This is only one way (\( \binom{1}{1} \)).

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Comparing the Cases

- The number of distributions for case 1 is 90.
- The number of distributions for case 2 is 60.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
