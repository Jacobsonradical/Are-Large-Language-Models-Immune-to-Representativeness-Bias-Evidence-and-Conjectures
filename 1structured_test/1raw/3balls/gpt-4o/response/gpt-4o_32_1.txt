Let's calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

First, we consider **Case 1** (distribution 2, 2, 2):

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of combinations is \( \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \).
2. Now choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. The number of combinations is \( \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \).
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C, which only has 1 way to happen.

So, the total number of distributions for case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

Next, we consider **Case 2** (distribution 2, 3, 1):

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of combinations is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).
2. Now choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. The number of combinations is \( \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4 \).
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C, which only has 1 way to happen.

So, the total number of distributions for case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two totals, we have 90 possible distributions for case 1 and 60 possible distributions for case 2.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
