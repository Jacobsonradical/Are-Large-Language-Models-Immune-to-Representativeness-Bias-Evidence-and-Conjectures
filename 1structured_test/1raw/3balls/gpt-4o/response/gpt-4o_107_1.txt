To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur.

First, let's compute the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by \(3^6\) because each ball has 3 choices:
\[
3^6 = 729
\]

We'll now calculate the number of ways for each specific case:

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A (which is \( \binom{6}{2} \)).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B (which is \( \binom{4}{2} \)).
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C.

The binomial coefficient is used to choose the subsets of balls:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A (which is \( \binom{6}{2} \)).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B (which is \( \binom{4}{3} \)).
3. The last ball automatically goes to C.

The binomial coefficient is used to choose the subsets of balls:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
To compare the number of results of case 1 and case 2, we see:
\[
\text{Number of ways for case 1: } 90
\]
\[
\text{Number of ways for case 2: } 60
\]

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

The answer is:
\({case: 1}\)
