To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will result more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur. This problem involves counting how many ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children A, B, and C with the given constraints. Let's compute the number of distinct distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

For this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to C.

1. Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C.

The total number of ways for this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \]

Let's compute this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

For this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.

1. Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The last ball automatically goes to C.

The total number of ways for this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \]

Let's compute this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 ways.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 ways.

Since 90 > 60, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
