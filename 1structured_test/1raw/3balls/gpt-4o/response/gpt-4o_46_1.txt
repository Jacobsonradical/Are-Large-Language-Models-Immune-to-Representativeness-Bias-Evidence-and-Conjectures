To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) according to each distribution pattern.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The number of ways to split 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls can be calculated by:
1. Select 2 balls out of 6 balls for child A.
2. Select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
3. The remaining 2 balls will go to child C.

The number of ways to do this is given by the product of binomial coefficients:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

The number of ways to split 6 balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball can be calculated by:
1. Select 2 balls out of 6 balls for child A.
2. Select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
3. The remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

The number of ways to do this is given by the product of binomial coefficients:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

Comparing the results:
- The number of ways for case 1 is 90.
- The number of ways for case 2 is 60.

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
