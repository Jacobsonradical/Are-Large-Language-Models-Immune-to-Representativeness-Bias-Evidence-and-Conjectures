To answer the question, we need to compute the probability of each case happening by counting the number of favorable distributions for each case.

Let's start with case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of the 6 available:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]

The remaining 2 balls are automatically assigned to C. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute balls such that A gets 2, B gets 2, and C gets 2 is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90
   \]

Now, let's move on to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of the 6 available:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]

The remaining 1 ball is automatically assigned to C. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60
   \]

So, comparing the two cases:
- The number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is 90.
- The number of ways to achieve case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is 60.

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
