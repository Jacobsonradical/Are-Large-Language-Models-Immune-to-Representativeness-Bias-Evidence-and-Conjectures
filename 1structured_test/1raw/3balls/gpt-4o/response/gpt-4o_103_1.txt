To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children such that the number of balls each child gets matches the two cases specified.

**Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls**

For Case 1, we can calculate the number of distributions as follows:
1. Select 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C: \(\binom{2}{2}\)

Calculation:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball**

For Case 2, we can calculate the number of distributions as follows:
1. Select 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

Calculation:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Given these calculations:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

The answer is:
\{case: 1\}
