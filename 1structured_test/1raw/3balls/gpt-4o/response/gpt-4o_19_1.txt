To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into the specified distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last 2 balls will go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, which is just 1 way:
\[ \binom{2}{2} \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last ball will go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C, which is just 1 way:
\[ \binom{1}{1} \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases, we see that Case 1 has 90 ways and Case 2 has 60 ways.

### Conclusion
Case 1 where each child gets 2 balls occurs more frequently than Case 2 where the distribution is 2, 3, and 1 balls.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
