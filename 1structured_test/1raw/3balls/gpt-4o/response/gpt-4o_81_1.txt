To determine which case (1 or 2) is more likely to occur, we need to count the number of ways each distribution can happen and compare them.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Here, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.

1. Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

Number of ways for Case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

1. Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C.

Number of ways for Case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

**Comparison**
Case 1 has 90 ways, while Case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, Case 1 is more likely to occur than Case 2.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
