To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2**

The number of ways to distribute 2 balls each to A, B, and C can be computed as follows:

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

Using combinations, we get:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} \]

The values for the combinations are:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2! (6-2)!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2! (4-2)!} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2! (2-2)!} = 1 \]

Multiplying these together, we get:
\[ 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90 \]

Therefore, there are 90 ways for case 1.


**Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1**

The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C can be computed as follows:

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C.

Using combinations, we get:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} \]

The values for the combinations are:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3! (4-3)!} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

Multiplying these together, we get:
\[ 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 ways for case 2.


**Conclusion:**

Since there are more ways for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 on average in many rounds of the game.
