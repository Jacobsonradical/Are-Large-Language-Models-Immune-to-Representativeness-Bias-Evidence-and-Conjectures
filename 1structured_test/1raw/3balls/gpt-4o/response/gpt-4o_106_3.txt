To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of possible distributions (combinations) for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 will automatically go to child C. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this way is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \):

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2}
\]

Compute each combination separately:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

Then, multiply the two results:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball will automatically go to child C:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3}
\]

Compute each combination separately:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
\]

Then, multiply the two results:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

Since 90 distributions correspond to case 1 and 60 distributions correspond to case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
