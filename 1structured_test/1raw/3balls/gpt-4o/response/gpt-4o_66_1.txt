To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the 3 children for each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A. There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to choose 2 balls from 6.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways to choose 2 balls from 4.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

\[ \text{Total ways for Case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \times \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!0!} \]

\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 \]

\[ = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A. There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to choose 2 balls from 6.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways to choose 3 balls from 4.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

\[ \text{Total ways for Case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} \times \frac{1!}{1!(1-1)!} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times \frac{1!}{1!0!} \]

\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 \]

\[ = 60 \]

Since there are 90 ways for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
