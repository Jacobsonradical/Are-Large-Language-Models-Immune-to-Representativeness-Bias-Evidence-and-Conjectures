To determine which case will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur. Weâ€™ll use combinatorial methods to count the distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

First, we select 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{6}{2} \).

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

We are left with 4 balls. Next, we select 2 out of those 4 to give to child B.

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]

The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. Hence, there is only one way to assign the remaining balls to C.

So, the total number of ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

First, we select 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A.

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

This leaves us with 4 balls. Next, we select 3 out of those 4 to give to child B.

\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. Hence, there is only one way to assign the remaining ball to C.

So, the total number of ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2 is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Comparing the Cases

- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Based on the calculations, Case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, occurs more frequently than Case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
