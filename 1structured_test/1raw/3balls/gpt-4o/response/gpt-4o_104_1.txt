To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the probabilities for each case.

### Analysis:

We have 6 distinguishable balls distributed randomly among three children (A, B, C).

#### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]

3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 1:
\[
\text{Total ways for Case 1} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

#### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 3 out of 6 balls for child B:
   \[
   \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20
   \]

2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 3 balls for child A:
   \[
   \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 2:
\[
\text{Total ways for Case 2} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

### Conclusion:
Since there are more ways to achieve Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), in many rounds of the game, results corresponding to Case 1 will be more frequent than results corresponding to Case 2.
