To determine whether there will be more results of "case 1" or "case 2" in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of possible distributions for each case using combinatorial methods.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each of the three children gets exactly 2 balls.

- Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)
- Choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
- The last 2 balls automatically go to child C, so no more choices are necessary.

Since the children are distinguishable, we know the choices for each child do not overlap and the order in which we pick for the children matters.

Therefore, the total number of distributions for case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

- Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)
- Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- The last ball automatically goes to child C, so no more choices are necessary.

Similarly, for distinguishable children (though the order does not matter), the total number of distributions for case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Conclusion:
Since there are 90 ways to achieve case 1 and 60 ways to achieve case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
