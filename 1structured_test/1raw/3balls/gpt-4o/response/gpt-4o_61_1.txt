To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

### Total Number of Distributions

Initially, the total number of ways to distribute six distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) is given by:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In Case 1, each child receives exactly 2 balls. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 will go to child C.

1. Choose 2 out of 6 for A:
   \[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B:
   \[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]

3. The last 2 automatically go to C:
   \[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

Since the balls are distinguishable, the total count for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In Case 2, one child gets 1 ball, one child gets 2 balls, and the third gets 3 balls. We need to consider the permutations of these allocations among the children.

1. Choose 2 out of 6 for A:
   \[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B:
   \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

3. The last 1 ball automatically goes to C:
   \[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

There are 3! (6) permutations of which child gets which count:
\[ (A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, B:1, C:3), (A:3, B:2, C:1), (A:3, B:1, C:2), (A:1, B:2, C:3), (A:1, B:3, C:2) \]

Thus, the total count for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 \times 6 = 360 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two quantities:
- Number of ways to achieve Case 1: 90
- Number of ways to achieve Case 2: 360

Clearly, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1 over many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 2}
