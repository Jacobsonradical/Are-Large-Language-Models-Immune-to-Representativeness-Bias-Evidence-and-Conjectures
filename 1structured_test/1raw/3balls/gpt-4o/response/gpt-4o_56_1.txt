To determine which case, out of the two, occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of different ways each case can happen.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to select 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 2 will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). Then the number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). The two remaining balls go to C in only one way. Therefore, we have:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

So, there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to select 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 1 will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). Then the number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{3}\). The one remaining ball goes to C in only one way. Therefore, we have:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

So, there are 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

### Conclusion

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
