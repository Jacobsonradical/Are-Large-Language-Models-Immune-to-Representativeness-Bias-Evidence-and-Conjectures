To answer the question, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare the results.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways this can happen is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
- The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways this can happen is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the totals, we have:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since \( 90 > 60 \), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
