To determine which case will occur more frequently when 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children (A, B, C), we calculate the number of distinct distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to find the number of ways to partition 6 distinct balls into three groups of 2 balls each. This is computed using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} \]

Calculating this:
\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! = 2 \]
\[ 2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2! = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \]
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

Thus, there are 90 distinct ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 each.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to find the number of ways to partition 6 distinct balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1. This is also computed using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} \]

Calculating this:
\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! = 2 \]
\[ 3! = 6 \]
\[ 1! = 1 \]
\[ 2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1! = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 12 \]
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

Thus, there are 60 distinct ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1.

### Conclusion
By comparing the number of ways:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

So, case 1 should occur more frequently than case 2.
