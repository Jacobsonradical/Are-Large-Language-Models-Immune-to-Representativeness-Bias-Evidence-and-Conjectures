To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can happen. 

First, let's consider the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. Each ball can be given to one of the three children in \(3^6\) ways because each of the 6 balls has 3 choices.

So we have:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Now we'll calculate the number of ways for case 1 and case 2.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can choose 2 balls out of 6 for A in:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
Then, we can choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B in:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]
Finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to C (no choice necessary).

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. We can choose 2 balls out of 6 for A in:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
Then, we can choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B in:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Finally, the last ball automatically goes to C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Comparing Frequencies
We see that case 1 has 90 ways to occur, whereas case 2 has 60 ways. 

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2.
