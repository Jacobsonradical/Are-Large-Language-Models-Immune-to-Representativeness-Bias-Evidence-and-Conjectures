To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among three children following each of the specified cases. 

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Here, we want to find the number of ways to split 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each. We can use the multinomial coefficient to calculate this:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!}
\]
Calculating the factorial terms, we get:
\[
6! = 720 \quad \text{and} \quad 2! = 2
\]
Thus:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, we need to determine the number of ways to split 6 balls into three groups: one group with 2 balls, one group with 3 balls, and one group with 1 ball. We again use the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!}
\]
Calculating the factorial terms, we get:
\[
3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 1! = 1
\]
Thus:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the numbers:
- Case 1 occurs 90 times.
- Case 2 occurs 60 times.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2. 

So the answer is:
\[
\{ \text{case: 1} \}
\]
