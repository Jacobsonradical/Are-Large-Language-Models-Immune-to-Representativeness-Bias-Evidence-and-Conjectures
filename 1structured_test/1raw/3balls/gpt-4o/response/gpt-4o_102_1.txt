To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To calculate the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways for case 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

To calculate the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

The total number of ways for case 2:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 90 ways
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): 60 ways

Given these computations, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
