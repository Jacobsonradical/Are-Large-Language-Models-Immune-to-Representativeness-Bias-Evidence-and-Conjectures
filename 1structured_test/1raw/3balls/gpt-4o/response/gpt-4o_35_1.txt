To determine whether there will be more results of "case 1" or "case 2", we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring in one round of the game. 

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90.\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60.\]

**Comparing the two cases:**
- Case 1 results in 90 possible outcomes.
- Case 2 results in 60 possible outcomes.

Hence, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
