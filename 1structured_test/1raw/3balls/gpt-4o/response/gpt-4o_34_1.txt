To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that the specific conditions of each case are met.

### Case 1: Distribution A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to partition the 6 balls into three groups, each containing 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by:
\[
\frac{\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2}}{3!}
\]

Here's the breakdown of the calculation:
1. First, select 2 balls out of 6 to give to A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]
2. Now, select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]
3. Finally, give the remaining 2 balls to C:
   \[
   \binom{2}{2} = 1
   \]

Given the above selections, the product is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

However, this counts the permutations of the groups A, B, and C as distinct, but they are not. So we must divide by the number of permutations (3!):
\[
\frac{90}{3!} = \frac{90}{6} = 15
\]

Thus, the number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is 15.

### Case 2: Distribution A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to partition 6 balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another child gets 3 balls, and the last child gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this, without considering the children yet, is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1}
\]

Here's the breakdown:
1. First, select 2 balls out of 6 to give to A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]
2. Now, select 3 balls from the remaining 4 to give to B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
   \]
3. Finally, give the remaining 1 ball to C:
   \[
   \binom{1}{1} = 1
   \]

The product is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

In this case, the groups A, B, and C are distinct, so there's no need for further division by the number of permutations. The calculation itself inherently acknowledges the permutations.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is 60.

### Conclusion
Since 15 (case 1) < 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
