To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case. We will do this by counting the number of favorable distributions for each case and then comparing them.

**Total number of distributions:**

First, let's determine the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children. Each ball can go to any of the three children, so there are:
\[ 3^6 \text{ possible distributions} \]

Calculating:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \text{ total distributions} \]

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C:
\[ \binom{2}{2} \text{ or just 1 (no choice)} \]

So, the number of favorable ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]

Therefore:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C:
\[ \binom{1}{1} \text{ or just 1 (no choice)} \]

So, the number of favorable ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparing Cases:**

- Case 1 has 90 favorable distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 favorable distributions.

Since 90 > 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
