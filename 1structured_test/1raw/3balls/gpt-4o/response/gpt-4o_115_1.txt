To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen. Let's compute the number of ways to achieve each distribution.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
- Assign the remaining 2 balls to C: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

Thus, the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating the values:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
- Assign the remaining 1 ball to C: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

Thus, the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating the values:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the values for both cases:
- Case 1 has 90 possible ways.
- Case 2 has 60 possible ways.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is:
{case: 1}
