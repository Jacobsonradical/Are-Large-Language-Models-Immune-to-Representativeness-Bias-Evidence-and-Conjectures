To determine which case is more likely, we need to compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C. This can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways.

Using the binomial coefficient formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 \\
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \\
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 1
\]

Thus, the number of ways in Case 1 is:

\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 balls for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C. This can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways.

Using the binomial coefficient formula:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 \\
\binom{1}{1} = \frac{1!}{1!0!} = 1
\]

Thus, the number of ways in Case 2 is:

\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since \( 90 > 60 \), there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
