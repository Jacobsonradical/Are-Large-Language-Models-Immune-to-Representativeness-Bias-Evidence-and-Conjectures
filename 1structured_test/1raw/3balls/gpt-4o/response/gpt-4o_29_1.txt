To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children A, B, and C such that we achieve either case 1 or case 2.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The ways to distribute the balls in this case can be computed as follows:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 out of 4 to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. 

So the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The ways to distribute the balls in this case can be computed as follows:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 out of 4 to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C.

So the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 than in case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
