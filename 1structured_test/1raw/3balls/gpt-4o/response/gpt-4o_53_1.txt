To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A out of 6 is given by the combination \(\binom{6}{2}\):
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. Now, we choose 2 balls for B out of these 4:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]

The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. Thus, the number of ways of distributing the balls in this way is:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A out of 6 is given by the combination \(\binom{6}{2}\):
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. Now, we choose 3 balls for B out of these 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \]

The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C. Thus, the number of ways of distributing the balls in this way is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Based on our calculations, case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) occurs in 90 ways, while case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) occurs in 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results corresponding to case 1 than case 2.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
