To determine which of the two specified cases (case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, and case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1) is more likely to occur, we can calculate the probabilities of each case.

First, let's enumerate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable children. Each ball can be assigned to any of the 3 children, so there are \(3^6\) possible distributions overall.

\[3^6 = 729\]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 2 go to B, and which 2 go to C. This can be done as follows:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways
- Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways
- The remaining 2 balls will go to C: \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways

Thus, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:

\[\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways
- Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1}\) ways
- The remaining 1 ball will go to C: \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways

Thus, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:

\[\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\]

### Comparison
Now we compare the number of favorable distributions for each case:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 than in case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{case: 1}
