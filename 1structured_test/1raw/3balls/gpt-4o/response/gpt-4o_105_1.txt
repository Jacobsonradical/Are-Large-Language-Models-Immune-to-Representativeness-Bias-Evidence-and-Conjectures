To determine which case will be more common over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in each case. 

1. **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the combination \(\binom{6}{2}\).
   - After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls remaining. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of these 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
   - The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   The total number of ways to achieve this distribution is the product of the two combinations:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 15 \times 6 = 90.
   \]

2. **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
   - We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 1 ball will automatically go to child C.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
   - After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls remaining. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of these 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
   - The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

   The total number of ways to achieve this distribution is the product of the two combinations:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 15 \times 4 = 60.
   \]

Comparing the two cases, we see:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Answer:
{case: 1}
