To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways the 6 balls can be distributed among the children under each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Then, the number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Then, the number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

When comparing the number of ways for each case, we see:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

**Answer:**
\{case: 1\}
