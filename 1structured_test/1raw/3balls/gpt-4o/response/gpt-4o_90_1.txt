To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 when 6 distinguishable balls are distributed among three children, we need to compute the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: Distribution 2-2-2
For case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\).
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{2}\):
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]

The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically, so there is only 1 way to do this.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

However, we must account for permutations of A, B, and C because each child could be A, B, or C. There are 3! permutations of these labels:
\[ 3! = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[ 90 / 6 = 15 \]

### Case 2: Distribution 2-3-1
For case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\):
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\):
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \]

The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically, so there is only 1 way to do this.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

However, again we account for permutations. There are 3 ways to permute the labels 2, 3, and 1 among A, B, and C (because 2-3-1 is a specific order and distinct from 3-2-1 or 1-2-3):
\[ 3 \]

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 15 ways
- Case 2: 180 ways

Clearly, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Using the required answer format:
{case: 2}
