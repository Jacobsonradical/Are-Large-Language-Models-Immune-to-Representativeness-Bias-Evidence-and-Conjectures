To determine whether case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: (A:2, B:2, C:2)**
1. Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Thus, the number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \]
\[ = 90 \]

**Case 2: (A:2, B:3, C:1)**
1. Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

Thus, the number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} \]
\[ = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \]
\[ = 60 \]

By comparing the two numbers, 90 and 60, we see that there are more ways to achieve case 1 than case 2.

Hence, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
