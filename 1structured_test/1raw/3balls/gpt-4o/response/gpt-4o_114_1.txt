To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur.

1. **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
   - We need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to C.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:
  
     \[
     \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!}
     \]

   - Calculating this,

     \[
     \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
     \]

2. **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
   - We need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last ball will automatically go to C.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

     \[
     \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!}
     \]

   - Calculating this,

     \[
     \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
     \]

Comparing the two results:
- Case 1 occurs in 90 ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 60 ways.

Given these calculations, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

So the answer is:
{case: 1}
