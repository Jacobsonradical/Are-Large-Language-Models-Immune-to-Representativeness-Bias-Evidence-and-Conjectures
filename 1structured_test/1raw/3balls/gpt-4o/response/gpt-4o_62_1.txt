To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will be more common in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

There are \( 3^6 \) total ways to distribute the balls since each ball can go to any of the 3 children:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

For this case, we need to choose which 2 out of the 6 balls go to each child. We then divide these choices among the three children.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]

2. Out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 balls for B:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]

3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The product of these choices, multiplied by the different ways we can assign two balls to three children (since they are distinguishable), gives:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \times \frac{1}{3!} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

For this case, we need to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

2. Out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 balls for B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

The product of these choices gives:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the number of favorable outcomes for each case:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case}: 1 \} \]
