To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

There are \(3^6\) total ways of distributing 6 balls among 3 children because each ball has 3 possible recipients.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
Next, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = 6
\]
The leftover 2 balls automatically go to C.

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
Next, we choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]
The leftover 1 ball automatically goes to C.

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
\[
90 \text{ (Case 1) } > 60 \text{ (Case 2) }
\]

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
