Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

To find how many ways each ball distribution can happen, we use the multinomial coefficient:

For case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 each is given by:
\[ \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} \]

Breaking it down:
\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! \times 2! \times 2! = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \]
\[ \text{Hence, the number of ways for Case 1} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

For case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups with specific sizes 2, 3, and 1 can be found by:
\[ \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} \]

Breaking it down:
\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! \times 3! \times 1! = 2 \times 6 \times 1 = 12 \]
\[ \text{Hence, the number of ways for Case 2} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer:
{case: 1}
