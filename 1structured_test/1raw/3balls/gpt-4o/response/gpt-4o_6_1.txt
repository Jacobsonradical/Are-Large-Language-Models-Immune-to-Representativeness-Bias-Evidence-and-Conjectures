To determine if there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of distinct ways each distribution can occur. 

First, let's compute the number of ways each distribution can occur:

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. 

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A: This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B: This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to C: This can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways.

So the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
= 15 \times 6 \times 1
= 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A: This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B: This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining ball goes to C: This can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways.

So the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
= 15 \times 4 \times 1
= 60
\]

### Comparison

- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 compared to case 2:

\[
\text{{case: }} 1
\]

Hence, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
