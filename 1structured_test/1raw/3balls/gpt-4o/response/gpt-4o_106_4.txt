To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of possible outcomes for each distribution.

**Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 children**:
Since the balls are distinguishable, each of the 6 balls can go to any of the 3 children. Therefore, the total number of possible distributions is:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Next, let's compute the number of ways each case can occur:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

Therefore:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C.

Therefore:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Now, let's compare the two cases:
\[ \text{Case 1:} \quad 90 \]
\[ \text{Case 2:} \quad 60 \]

Since 90 (for case 1) is greater than 60 (for case 2), case 1 will occur more frequently.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
