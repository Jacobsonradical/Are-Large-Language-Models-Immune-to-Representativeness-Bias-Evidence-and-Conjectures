First, let's compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each of the given cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. 

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

### Conclusion
Since there are 90 ways to achieve case 1 compared to 60 ways to achieve case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
