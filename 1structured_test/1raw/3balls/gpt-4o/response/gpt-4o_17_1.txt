To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 will automatically go to C.

- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

- Number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]

- The last 2 balls automatically go to C, so there's only 1 way for this step.

The total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 1 will automatically go to C.

- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

- Number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

- The last 1 ball automatically goes to C, so there's only 1 way for this step.

The total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Since there are 90 ways for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case}: 1 \} \]
