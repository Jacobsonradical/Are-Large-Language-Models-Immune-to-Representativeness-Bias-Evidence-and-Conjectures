To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into the configurations specified by case 1 and case 2.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Then, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to C, which can be done in only 1 way.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Then, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C, which can be done in only 1 way.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparison:**

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 than in case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
