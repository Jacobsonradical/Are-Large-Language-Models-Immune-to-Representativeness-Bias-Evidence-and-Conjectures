To determine whether there will be more outcomes corresponding to case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of possible ways for each distribution to occur and then compare those numbers.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which is a generalization of the binomial coefficient.

The formula for the multinomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}\) is given by:
\[
\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \ldots k_m!}
\]

For case 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! 2! 2!}
\]

First, compute the factorials:
\[
6! = 720, \quad 2! = 2
\]

Then calculate the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 2:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! 3! 1!}
\]

Compute the factorials:
\[
6! = 720, \quad 2! = 2, \quad 3! = 6, \quad 1! = 1
\]

Then calculate the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

### Comparison
- Number of ways for case 1: 90
- Number of ways for case 2: 60

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more outcomes corresponding to case 1.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\{ \text{case: 1} \}
\]
