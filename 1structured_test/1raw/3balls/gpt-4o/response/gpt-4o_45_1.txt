Let's calculate the probability of each case:
- Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

There are a total of 3^6 ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. However, we want to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each specific distribution case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to count the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last 2 balls go to child C.

The number of ways to select 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]
The number of ways to select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Since the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, we don't need to choose anything for them. So,
\[ \text{Total ways for Case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \]

Let's calculate it:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Total for Case 1} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Let's count the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.

The number of ways to select 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]
The number of ways to select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

Since the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C, we don't need to choose anything for them. So,
\[ \text{Total ways for Case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \]

Let's calculate it:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total for Case 2} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Comparison of Probability

We can now compare the number of favorable outcomes for each case:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the result is:
{case: 1}
