To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into the specified distributions for each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. **Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A:** There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. **Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B:** There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
3. **The last 2 balls go to child C:** There is 1 way to do this.

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. **Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A:** There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. **Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B:** There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
3. **The last ball goes to child C:** There is 1 way to do this.

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Therefore, there are more ways to achieve Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways). Hence, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.
