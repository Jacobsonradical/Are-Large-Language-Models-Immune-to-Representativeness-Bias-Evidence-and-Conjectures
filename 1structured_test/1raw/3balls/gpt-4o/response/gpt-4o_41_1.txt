To determine if there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can compute the number of ways each distribution can occur. 

**Case 1: Distribution A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C. There is only 1 way to do that.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating the combinations:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]

\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: Distribution A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The remaining ball goes to child C. There is only 1 way to do that.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating the combinations:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4
\]

\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two results, we have:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:

\{case: 1\}
