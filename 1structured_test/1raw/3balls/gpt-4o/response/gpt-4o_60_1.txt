To determine which case will occur more frequently—case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)—we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that the distribution follows the specified cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C: \(1\) way (no choice left).

So the total number of ways to achieve Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C: \(1\) way (no choice left).

So the total number of ways to achieve Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Given these calculations:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Thus, there are **more ways** to achieve Case 1 than Case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, results of Case 1 will occur more frequently than results of Case 2.

The answer is:
``` {case: 1} ```
