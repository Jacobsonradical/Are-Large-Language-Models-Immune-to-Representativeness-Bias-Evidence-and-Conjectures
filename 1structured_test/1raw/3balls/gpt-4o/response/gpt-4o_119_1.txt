To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2, we need to calculate the probability or count of each case occurring. 

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case.

1. **Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and 2 balls for child C. The total number of ways to do this is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

So the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

2. **Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining ball for child C. The total number of ways to do this is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**

Comparing the counts for the two cases, we have:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of Case 1.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
