To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed according to each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

The number of ways we can choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by \( \binom{6}{2} \).

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for B is \( \binom{4}{2} \).

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, so we don't need any further choices.

So, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \]
\[ = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is \( \binom{6}{2} \).

The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for B is \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

So, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \]
\[ = 60 \]

### Comparison
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

From the above calculations, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
