To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will be more likely to occur in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the probabilities associated with each case.

First, we calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. Each ball has 3 possible choices (A, B, or C). Therefore, the total number of distributions is:
\[ 3^6 \]

Now let's consider case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. 

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of these 4 for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

Now let's consider case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of these 4 for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the number of ways for each case:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
