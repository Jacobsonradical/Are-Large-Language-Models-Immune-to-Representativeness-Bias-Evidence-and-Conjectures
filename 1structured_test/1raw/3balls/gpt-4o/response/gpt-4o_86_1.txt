To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the probabilities of each case occurring.

### Calculation:

For 6 distinguishable balls, there are \( 3^6 \) possible ways to distribute the balls among the 3 children, since each ball can be placed with any of the 3 children. This gives us:

\[ 3^6 = 729 \text{ total possible distributions.} \]

#### Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls

First, choose 2 out of 6 balls to go to child A, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways. Then, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to child B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \text{ ways.} \]

#### Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball

First, choose 2 out of 6 balls to go to child A, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways. Then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to go to child B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways. The remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ ways.} \]

### Comparison:

- Number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 90
- Number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): 60

Therefore, there are more ways to achieve Case 1 compared to Case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
