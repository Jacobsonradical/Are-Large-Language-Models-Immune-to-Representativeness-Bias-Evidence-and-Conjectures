To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for both specified cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We must count the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, so there is only 1 way to do this.

Combining these, the total number of ways is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We must count the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets exactly 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C, so there is only 1 way to do this.

Combining these, the total number of ways is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the results from both cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Hence, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) over many rounds of the game.

The answer is:
{case: 1}
