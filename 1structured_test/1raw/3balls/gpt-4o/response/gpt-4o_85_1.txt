To determine which case is more likely to occur, we need to compute the probabilities of each case. We can do this by calculating the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children in the specified cases and then comparing those counts.

For the distribution of 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children:

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. 
   This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Next, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
   This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. 
   There is only 1 way to do this.

So, the number of ways to achieve Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
   This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
   This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The last ball automatically goes to child C. 
   There is only 1 way to do this.

So, the number of ways to achieve Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Comparison of Case 1 and Case 2

From the calculations above:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of Case 1 compared to Case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
