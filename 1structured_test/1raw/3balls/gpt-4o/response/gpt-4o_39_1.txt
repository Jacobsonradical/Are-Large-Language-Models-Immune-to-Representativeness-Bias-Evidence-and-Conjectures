To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls into each of the two cases:

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls in a way that each child gets exactly 2 balls.
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to distribute 6 balls in a way that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The last 1 ball automatically goes to C: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways of occurrence.
- Case 2 has 60 ways of occurrence.

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

### Final Answer:
{case: 1}
