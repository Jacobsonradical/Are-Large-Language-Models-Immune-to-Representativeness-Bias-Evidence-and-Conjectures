To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways in which the balls can be distributed among the children in these two cases.

**Case 1**: A:2, B:2, C:2
1. Select 2 balls out of the 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. After selecting 2 balls for A, select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{4}{2} \).
3. The last 2 remaining balls automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways for this case is thus:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} =  \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times  \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2**: A:2, B:3, C:1
1. Select 2 balls out of the 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. After selecting 2 balls for A, select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{4}{3} \).
3. The last remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

The total number of ways for this case is thus:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} =  \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times  \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Thus, comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

**Final Answer**:
{case: 1}
