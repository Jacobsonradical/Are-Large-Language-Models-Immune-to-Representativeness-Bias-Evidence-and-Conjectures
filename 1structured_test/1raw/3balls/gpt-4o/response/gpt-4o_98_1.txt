To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways the 6 balls can be distributed according to each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls to give to child A from 6 balls.
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]
2. Choose 2 balls to give to child B from the remaining 4 balls.
\[
\binom{4}{2}
\]
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
There is no choice left here, it is just one way.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 
\]
So, the total for case 1:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls to give to child A from 6 balls.
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]
2. Choose 3 balls to give to child B from the remaining 4 balls.
\[
\binom{4}{3}
\]
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.
There is no choice left here, it is just one way.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 
\]
So, the total for case 2:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

### Final Answer:
{case: 1}
