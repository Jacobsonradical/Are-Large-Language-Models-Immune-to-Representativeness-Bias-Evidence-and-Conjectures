To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the probability of each case happening.

### Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

The formula for the total number of distributions is:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Next, we calculate the number of distributions where each child gets exactly 2 balls. This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved using the multinomial coefficient.

The number of ways to divide the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each can be computed using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

However, these 90 ways are just the ways to partition the 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 balls. Since the groups are assigned to each child, we also need to account for the different permutations of these groups being assigned to child A, B, and C.

There are \(3!\) (6) permutations of assigning these groups to children.

Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes for Case 1 is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

### Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
We need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Comparing Outcomes:
- Total number of favorable outcomes for Case 1: 540
- Total number of favorable outcomes for Case 2: 60

### Conclusion:
Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) will occur more frequently than Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
