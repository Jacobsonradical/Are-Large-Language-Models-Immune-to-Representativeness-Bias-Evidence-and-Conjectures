To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into the distributions specified by each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Comparing the numbers for both cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
