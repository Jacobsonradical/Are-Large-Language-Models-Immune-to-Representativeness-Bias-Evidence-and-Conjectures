To determine whether Case 1 or Case 2 is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

**Total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children:**

\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Each ball can go to one of three children, hence \(3^6\) possible distributions.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

Then, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B:

\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]

The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

So, the number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is:

\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

Then, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

So, the number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is:

\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

**Comparison:**

- Number of ways to achieve Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): \(90\)
- Number of ways to achieve Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): \(60\)

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
