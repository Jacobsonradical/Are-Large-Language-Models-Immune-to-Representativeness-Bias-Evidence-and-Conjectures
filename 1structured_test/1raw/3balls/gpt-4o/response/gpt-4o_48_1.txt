To determine which case will occur more frequently (case 1 or case 2), we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

For each distribution scenario:

### Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls
We need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A, then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last 2 balls go to C.

The number of ways to do this is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

Then, the total number of distributions for case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball
We need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last ball goes to C.

The number of ways to do this is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating each binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

Then, the total number of distributions for case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Comparing the counts of possible distributions:
- Case 1: 90 distributions
- Case 2: 60 distributions

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
