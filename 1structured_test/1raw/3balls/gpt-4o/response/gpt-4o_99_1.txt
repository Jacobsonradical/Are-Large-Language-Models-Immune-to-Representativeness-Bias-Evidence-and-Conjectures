To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the probabilities of each distribution, case 1 and case 2.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

First, we calculate the number of ways to partition 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 each. This is a combinatorial problem, often computed using the multinomial coefficient:

The number of ways to distribute the balls such that A, B, and C each get 2 balls is given by:

\[
\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Next, we calculate the number of ways to partition 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is given by:

\[
\frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the two results:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2 in any given round.

\[
\text{{More results of }} \text{Case 1}
\]

**Conclusion:**

\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
