To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) is more likely to occur, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen. We will use combinations and permutations to find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children in each specified case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically.

Thus, the total number of ways for case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically.

Thus, the total number of ways for case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
By comparing the number of ways each distribution can occur, we find:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
