To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the probability of each case.

Consider the two cases:

**Case 1:** A:2, B:2, C:2  
**Case 2:** A:2, B:3, C:1

First, we calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. For each ball, there are 3 choices (A, B, or C), so the total number of distributions is:

\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Next, we use combinations to determine the number of ways to achieve each specific distribution.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To achieve this distribution, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and 2 balls will be left for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k". Calculating these,

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15, \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6, \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1. \]

Thus,

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

To achieve this distribution, we choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the remaining ball for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating these,

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4, \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1. \]

Thus,

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Therefore, we have:

- 90 ways to get the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2
- 60 ways to get the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways), there will indeed be more results corresponding to case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
