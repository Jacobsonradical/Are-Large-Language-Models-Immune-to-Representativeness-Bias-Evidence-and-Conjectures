To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to calculate the number of ways to divide 6 distinguishable balls into three groups, where each group has exactly 2 balls. This can be achieved by the following steps:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Mathematically, we use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \) to choose \( k \) items from \( n \) items without regard to the order.

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2}
\]

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

\[
\text{Number of ways for case 1} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

Since each child receives an exact number of balls, there are no additional arrangements for how they can be distributed among the children.

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to calculate the number of ways to divide 6 distinguishable balls into three groups, where one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball. This can be achieved by the following steps:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3}
\]

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
\]

\[
\text{Number of ways for one specific arrangement} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

However, there are multiple ways to assign which child gets 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively (A, B, and C can be permuted). There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) = 6 ways to assign the different groups to children.

\[
\text{Total number of ways for case 2} = 60 \times 6 = 360
\]

**Comparison:**

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 360 ways

Since 360 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 compared to case 1 in many rounds of the game.

\[
\{ \text{case}: 2 \}
\]
