To determine which case will occur more frequently when 6 distinguishable balls are distributed randomly among three children, we need to calculate the probability of each case.

### Total Number of Distributions
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children (A, B, and C) is given by:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child must receive exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to achieve this distribution can be calculated as follows:
1. Choose 2 out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Thus, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball. To calculate the number of ways to achieve this distribution:
1. Choose 2 out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

In addition, there are three possible assignments of these roles (A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball):
\[
3 \times \left( \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \right)
= 3 \times (15 \times 4 \times 1) = 3 \times 60 = 180
\]

### Conclusion: Which Case Occurs More Frequently?
From the calculations:
- Number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 90
- Number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): 180

Since Case 2 has more distribution ways than Case 1:

\[ \{ \text{case: 2} \} \]
