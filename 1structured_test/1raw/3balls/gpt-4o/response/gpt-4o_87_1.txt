To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways these specific distributions can occur. We'll use combinatorial reasoning to find the number of distinct distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and finally the remaining 2 for C. The number of ways to do this is calculated by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

However, since the orders of A, B, and C do not matter (having 2 balls each), we need to divide by the number of permutations of the three groups (since all are indistinguishable in terms of the number of balls):
\[
\frac{\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}}{3!}
\]
Calculating each part, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15, \quad \binom{4}{2} = 6, \quad \binom{2}{2} = 1
\]
So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\frac{15 \times 6 \times 1}{6} = 15
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and finally the remaining 1 for C. The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating each part, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15, \quad \binom{4}{3} = 4, \quad \binom{1}{1} = 1
\]
So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
There are 15 distinct ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 and 60 distinct ways for the balls to be distributed in case 2. Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
```
{case: 2}
```
