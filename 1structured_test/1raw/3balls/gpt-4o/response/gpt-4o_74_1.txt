To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) such that the ball counts match the given patterns for each case.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls so that each child receives exactly 2 balls. This corresponds to case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls**

To distribute the balls in this way:
1. Choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C.

The number of ways to do this, using combinations, is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

Next, let's find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. This corresponds to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

**Case 2: A:2 balls, B:3 balls, C:1 ball**

To distribute the balls in this way:
1. Choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

The number of ways to do this, using combinations, is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Comparing the number of ways:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls such that each child receives exactly 2 balls (case 1) than the distribution where one child receives 2 balls, another receives 3, and the last receives 1 (case 2), we conclude that case 1 will occur more frequently.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
