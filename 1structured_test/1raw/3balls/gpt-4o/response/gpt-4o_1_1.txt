To determine which case, 1 or 2, is more likely to occur, we need to compute the number of ways these distributions can happen.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15\)
   
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6\)
   
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

Total number of ways for case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)
   
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4\)

3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

Total number of ways for case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

The number of ways each case can occur:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.
