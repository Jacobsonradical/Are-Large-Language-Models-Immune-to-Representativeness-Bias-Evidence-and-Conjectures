We can solve the problem by computing the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for both cases. Let's use combinatorial methods to do this.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose which 2 balls will go to child A:
   \[\binom{6}{2}\]
2. Choose which 2 of the remaining 4 balls will go to child B:
   \[\binom{4}{2}\]
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, so we don't need to choose further.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!0!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} \times \frac{4 \times 3}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose which 2 balls will go to child A:
   \[\binom{6}{2}\]
2. Choose which 3 of the remaining 4 balls will go to child B:
   \[\binom{4}{3}\]
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, so we don't need to choose further.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Comparison

- The number of ways to achieve Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is 90.
- The number of ways to achieve Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is 60.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
