Let's compute the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) for each of the given cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating these combinations, we get:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]

\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining ball will go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating these combinations, we get:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion:
Comparing the counts, Case 1 occurs 90 times and Case 2 occurs 60 times. Therefore, Case 1 is more likely to occur than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
