To find out whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions that fit each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

First, calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into groups of size 2, 2, and 2.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

So the total number of distributions for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Now calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into groups of size 2, 3, and 1.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

So the total number of distributions for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
The number of distributions fitting case 1 is 90, whereas the number of distributions fitting case 2 is 60. Therefore, there will be more results fitting case 1 than case 2.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
