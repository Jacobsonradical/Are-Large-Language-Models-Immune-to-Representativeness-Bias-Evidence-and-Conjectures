To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the probability of each case occurring by counting the number of favorable distributions for each case and comparing them.

First, let's find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. Each of the 6 balls can be given to any of the 3 children, so the total number of distributions is:

\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of favorable distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and 2 balls for child C. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 balls is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, which is given by \(\binom{4}{2}\). The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. Therefore, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. We need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the remaining ball goes to C. Therefore, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Comparison
To compare the two cases, we calculate their probabilities:

For case 1:
\[ P(\text{case 1}) = \frac{90}{729} = \frac{10}{81} \approx 0.1235 \]

For case 2:
\[ P(\text{case 2}) = \frac{60}{729} = \frac{20}{243} \approx 0.0823 \]

Since the probability of case 1 (approx. 0.1235) is greater than the probability of case 2 (approx. 0.0823), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
