To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children in each specified case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
   \]

3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

Since each distribution (i.e., case 1 and case 2) results in different numbers of ways to distribute the balls, we can now compare the two totals:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.

Final answer:
\{case: 1\}
