To determine which case, 1 or 2, will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways each case can occur and compare them.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

Let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child receives exactly 2 balls.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:  
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:  
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]

3. The 2 remaining balls go to child C automatically.

The total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that child A gets 2, child B gets 3, and child C gets 1.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:  
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:  
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically.

The total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

### Answer
\[
\{ \text{case}: 1 \}
