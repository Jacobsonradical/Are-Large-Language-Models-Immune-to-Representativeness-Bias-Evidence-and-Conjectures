To determine whether case 1 or case 2 is more likely, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

We start by calculating the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children. Each ball can be placed with any of the three children, so the total number of distributions is:
\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

First, compute the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to child A, which 2 go to child B, and which 2 go to child C:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:
\[ \binom{4}{2} = 6 \]
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to child C:
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

Since the order in which we assign the balls to children doesn't matter (A gets 2, B gets 2, C gets 2 in any order would count as the same distribution), we need to divide by the number of permutations of the children:
\[ 3! = 6 \]

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \frac{15 \times 6 \times 1}{6} = 15 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Next, compute the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to child A, which 3 go to child B, and which 1 goes to child C:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
3. The last ball automatically goes to child C:
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Case 2 is more likely because there are more ways for it to occur than case 1.

So the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case}: 2 \} \]
