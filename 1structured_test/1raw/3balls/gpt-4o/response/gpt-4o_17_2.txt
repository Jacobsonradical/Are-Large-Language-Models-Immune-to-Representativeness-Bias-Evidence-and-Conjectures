To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

There are a total of \( 6! \) ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to three children. For each child, there are \((3^6)\) ways to distribute the balls since each ball can go to any of the three children. However, we need to account for distinguishable children.

Let's calculate the number of ways for each case individually:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to C. There are \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways to do this.

So, the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C. There are \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways to do this.

So, the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60
\]

Given that there are \(3^6 = 729\) possible distributions of the balls to the children, the probabilities of each case can be compared based on their counts:

- Probability of Case 1: \( \frac{90}{729} \approx 0.1234 \)
- Probability of Case 2: \( \frac{60}{729} \approx 0.0823 \)

Thus, Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), based on our calculations.

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
