To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the probability of each case happening in a single round. To do this, we'll count the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, such that we have each of the specified distributions.

**Total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children:**
Each ball can go to any of the 3 children, so there are a total of \(3^6\) ways to distribute them.

\[ 3^6 = 729 \]

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To achieve the distribution where each child receives exactly 2 balls, we can follow these steps:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to go to child B.
3. The final 2 balls will automatically go to child C.
   
The number of ways to do this is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

To achieve the distribution where child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball, we can follow these steps:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to go to child B.
3. The final ball will automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to do this is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Now that we have the number of ways for each case, we can compare them. We have:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2 when playing many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
