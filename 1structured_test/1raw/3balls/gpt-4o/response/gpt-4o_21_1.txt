To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in both cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A.
2. Then, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \). After this, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, which is \( \binom{4}{2} \).

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A.
2. Then, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{2} \). After this, we choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, which is \( \binom{4}{3} \).

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

The answer is:

{case: 1}
