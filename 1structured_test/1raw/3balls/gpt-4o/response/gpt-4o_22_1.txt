To determine whether there will be more results for case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur. 

### Case 1: Distribution A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls will naturally go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{6}{2} \). After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left and we need to choose 2 out of these 4 for B, which is given by \( \binom{4}{2} \). The remaining 2 balls are automatically assigned to C.

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is:

\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: Distribution A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we need to choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} \). After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left and we need to choose 3 out of these 4 for B, which is given by \( \binom{4}{3} \). The remaining 1 ball is automatically assigned to C.

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is:

\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
In a large number of rounds, the outcomes will tend to distribute according to the number of ways each configuration can occur. Since case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 possible ways while case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has only 60 possible ways, case 1 is more likely to occur compared to case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

\{case: 1\}
