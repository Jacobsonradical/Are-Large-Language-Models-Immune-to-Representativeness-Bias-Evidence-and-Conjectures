To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to count the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to do this is given by:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

Let's compute this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]

\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 1 goes to child C.

The number of ways to do this is given by:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Let's compute this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]

\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two totals, we can see:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

The answer is:
{case: 1}
