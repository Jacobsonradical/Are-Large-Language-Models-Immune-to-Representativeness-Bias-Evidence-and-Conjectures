To determine whether there will be more results for case 1 or case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls (case 1).

\[ \text{Number of ways to distribute 6 balls in case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Here, \( \binom{6}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then \( \binom{4}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and finally \( \binom{2}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls for C.

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball (case 2).

\[ \text{Number of ways to distribute 6 balls in case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Here, \( \binom{6}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, \( \binom{4}{3} \) is the number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and \( \binom{1}{1} \) is the number of ways to choose the remaining 1 ball for C.

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, over many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
