To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will be more frequent over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of favorable distributions for each case.

Let's start with case 1:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
   \]
2. After assigning 2 balls to A, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
   \]
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls for case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

Next, let's consider case 2:

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]
2. After assigning 2 balls to A, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
   \]
3. The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the counts:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
