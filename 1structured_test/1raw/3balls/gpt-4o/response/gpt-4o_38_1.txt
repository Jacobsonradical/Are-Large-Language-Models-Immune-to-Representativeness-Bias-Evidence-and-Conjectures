To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probabilities for each case.

**Case 1**: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 each.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is given by \( \binom{4}{2} \).
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. The number of ways to distribute these 2 balls among 2 children is 1.

So, the total number of ways for A:2, B:2, C:2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3!} = \frac{15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1}{6} = 15 \]
The division by 3! accounts for the permutations of the groups being indistinguishable.

**Case 2**: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2, 3, and 1.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by \( \binom{6}{2} \).
2. Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is given by \( \binom{4}{3} \).
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. The number of ways to distribute this 1 ball among 1 child is 1.

So, the total number of ways for A:2, B:3, C:1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{2!} = \frac{15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1}{2} = 30 \]
The division by 2! accounts for the permutations of the two groups (A and B) being indistinguishable.

By comparison, there are 15 ways for case 1 and 30 ways for case 2.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
