To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we can calculate the total number of ways that each case can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to divide 6 distinguishable balls into three groups, each of size 2. This can be calculated using combinatorial methods.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to be given to child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
   \]
2. Out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 balls to be given to child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
   \]
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, and there's just 1 way to pick these.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve A:2, B:2, C:2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

However, since the order of A, B, and C receiving balls doesn't matter in this case (itâ€™s the configurations we care about, not the identities), there is no need to divide by the factorial of identical groups since they are distinguishable by the child.

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to be given to child A:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]
2. Out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 balls to be given to child B:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C, and there's just 1 way to pick it.

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve A:2, B:3, C:1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Therefore, based on the calculations, case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) occurs more frequently than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
