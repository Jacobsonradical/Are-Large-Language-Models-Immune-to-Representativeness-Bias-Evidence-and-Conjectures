First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each of the cases.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 2 balls go to B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. This can be calculated as follows:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)

The number of ways to distribute the balls is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to choose which 2 balls go to A, which 3 balls go to B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C. This can be calculated as follows:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)

The number of ways to distribute the balls is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two results:

- Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes.
- Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.

Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results corresponding to Case 1.

**Answer**:
{case: 1}
