To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen. We'll use combinatorial methods.

Let's start with case 1.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

- We need to select 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 each is:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Here, \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items without regard to order.

Calculating that:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways is:

\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

Next, we must consider that the groups are distinguishable, resulting in any permutation of these groups being a distinct case. For three distinct children A, B, and C, the number of distinguishable distributions is \( \frac{90}{3!} = 15 \).

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

- We need to select 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

The total number of ways to do this is:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating that:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]

\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways is:

\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Considering again distinguishable groups:

This time, the groups themselves being A, B, and C are fixed. So this 60 is itself the number of distinguishable distributions.

Finally, to compare:

- Case 1: 15 distinguished distributions
- Case 2: 60 distinguished distributions

Clearly, case 2 occurs more frequently than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
