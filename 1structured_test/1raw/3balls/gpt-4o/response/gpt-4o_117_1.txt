To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children such that each case is satisfied. We'll use combinatorial methods to find the number of distributions for both cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
   \]

2. We then need to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]

3. The remaining 2 balls are given to child C, and the number of ways to do this is 1 (since there is no choice left).

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
   \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = 15
   \]

2. We then need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = 4
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball is given to child C, and the number of ways to do this is 1 (since there is no choice left).

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls so that one child gets 2, another gets 3, and another gets 1 ball is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
   \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the counts of distributions:

- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 possible distributions.

Therefore, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
