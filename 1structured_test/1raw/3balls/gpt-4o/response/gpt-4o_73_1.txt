To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to compute the number of distinct ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children in the specified arrangements for each case.

**Case 1: Distribution A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Select 2 out of 6 balls to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically: \(\binom{2}{2}\) way.

Thus, the number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: Distribution A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Select 2 out of 6 balls to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways (Note: \(\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1}\)).
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically: \(\binom{1}{1}\) way.

Thus, the number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparing the Number of Ways:**
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 90 ways
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case}: 1 \} \]
