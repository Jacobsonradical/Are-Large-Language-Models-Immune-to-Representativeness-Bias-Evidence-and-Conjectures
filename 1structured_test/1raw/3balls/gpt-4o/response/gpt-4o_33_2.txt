To determine which case is more likely over many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the balls corresponding to each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Select 2 balls for child A out of 6 balls: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Select 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically.

The number of distributions for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

However, this is the number of ways without considering the distinguishability of the children. Since the children are distinguishable, we must divide by the number of permutations of the distributions:
\[
\frac{90}{3!} = \frac{90}{6} = 15
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Select 2 balls for child A out of 6 balls: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Select 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically.

The number of distributions for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \times \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} \times \frac{4}{1} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Again, considering the distinguishability of the children:
\[
\frac{60}{3!} = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

### Conclusion

After comparing the two cases, we have:
- Case 1: 15 ways
- Case 2: 10 ways

There are more ways to achieve the results in case 1 than in case 2. Therefore, over many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
