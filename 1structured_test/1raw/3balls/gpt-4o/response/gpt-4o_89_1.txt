To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will have more results over many rounds of the game, let's calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

This case means each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls equally among 3 children.

Number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 for A:
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]

Number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B:
\[
\binom{4}{2}
\]

The remaining 2 go to C, which is automatically assigned:
\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

Thus the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

For this case, we need to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1.

Number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 for A:
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]

Number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4
\]

The remaining 1 goes to C, which is automatically assigned:
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

Thus the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Comparison

- Case 1 has \( 90 \) ways.
- Case 2 has \( 60 \) ways.

Therefore, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.
