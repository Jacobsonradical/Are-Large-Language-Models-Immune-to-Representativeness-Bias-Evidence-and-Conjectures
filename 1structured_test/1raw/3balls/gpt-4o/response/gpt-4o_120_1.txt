To answer the question of whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that the distributions match either case 1 or case 2. Let's calculate these distributions step-by-step.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C: 2
We need to select 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The remaining 2 balls will be for C: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

Calculating these combinations:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways to achieve the distribution in case 1:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to select 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball will go to child C.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The remaining 1 ball will be for C: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

Calculating these combinations:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the number of ways to achieve the distribution in case 2:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Since there are more ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets 2 each in case 1 than there are ways to distribute them such that one child gets 3, another gets 2, and the last one gets 1 as in case 2, we conclude that:

{case: 1}
