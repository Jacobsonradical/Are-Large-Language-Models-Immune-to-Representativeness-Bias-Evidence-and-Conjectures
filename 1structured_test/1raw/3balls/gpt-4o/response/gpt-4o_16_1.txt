To solve the problem, we'll calculate the number of different ways the balls can be distributed for each case and see which one has more outcomes.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

There are more ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 than in Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
