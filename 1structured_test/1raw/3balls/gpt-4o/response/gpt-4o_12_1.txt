To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to compare the number of possible distributions for each case.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, such that each child gets a specified number of balls.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A.
   \[
   \binom{6}{2}
   \]

2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B.
   \[
   \binom{4}{2}
   \]

3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C.
   \[
   \binom{2}{2} = 1
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
   \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A.
   \[
   \binom{6}{2}
   \]

2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B.
   \[
   \binom{4}{3}
   \]

3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.
   \[
   \binom{1}{1} = 1
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
   \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
   \]

### Conclusion

By comparing the two results:
- Case 1: There are 90 possible ways to distribute the balls.
- Case 2: There are 60 possible ways to distribute the balls.

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
   \{case: 1\}
   \]
