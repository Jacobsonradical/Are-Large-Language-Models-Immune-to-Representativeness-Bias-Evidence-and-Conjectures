To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children in each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for Child A: There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for Child B: There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to Child C.

The calculations are:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 for Child A: There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for Child B: There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to Child C.

The calculations are:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \binom{4}{1} = 4 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

The number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is 90, while in Case 2, it is 60. Hence, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
