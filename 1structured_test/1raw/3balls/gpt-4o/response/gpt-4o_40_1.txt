To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we must calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children for each case.

### Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. This involves:
1. Choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to do this is:
\[ 
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 
\]

### Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C. This involves:
1. Choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choosing 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Given the above calculations:
- There are 90 ways to distribute the balls corresponding to Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
- There are 60 ways to distribute the balls corresponding to Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results corresponding to Case 1.

**So the answer is:**
{case: 1}
