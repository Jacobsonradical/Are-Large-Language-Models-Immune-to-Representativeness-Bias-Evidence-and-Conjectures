To determine which case is more likely, we need to calculate the probabilities of each distribution occurring. We will count the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls into each case and then compare the counts.

First, we compute the number of ways for each case:

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
1. Choose 2 balls for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically.

Calculations:
\[ \text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
1. Choose 2 balls for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C automatically.

Calculations:
\[ \text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2.

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
