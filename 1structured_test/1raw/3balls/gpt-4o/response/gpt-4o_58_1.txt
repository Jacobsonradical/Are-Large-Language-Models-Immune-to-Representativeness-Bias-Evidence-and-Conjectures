To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to count the number of ways each distribution can happen. This is a combinatorial problem.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 to give to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Select 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls will go to C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Select 2 balls out of 6 to give to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The remaining 1 ball will go to C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Given these calculations:
- Case 1 occurs in 90 different ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 60 different ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

The answer is:
{case: 1}
