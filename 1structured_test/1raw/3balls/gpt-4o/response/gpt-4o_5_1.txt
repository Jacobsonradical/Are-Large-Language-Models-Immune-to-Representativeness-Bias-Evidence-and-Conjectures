To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways of distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that the distributions match the cases specified.

First, let's compute the number of ways for each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
- The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C.

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results for case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
