To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls in each of the described cases.

### Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases, we see:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Hence, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

The answer is:
{case: 1}
