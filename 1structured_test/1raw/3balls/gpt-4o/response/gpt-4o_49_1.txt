To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare these counts.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child gets exactly 2 balls. We need to find the number of ways to partition 6 distinguishable balls into three groups where each group has exactly 2 balls. This can be approached using combinatorics.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is:
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]

After choosing 2 out of 6 balls for child A, 4 balls are left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of these 4 for child B is:
\[
\binom{4}{2}
\]

The remaining 2 balls will go to child C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, we need to find the number of ways to partition 6 distinguishable balls into three groups where one group has 2 balls, one group has 3 balls, and the final group has 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is:
\[
\binom{6}{2}
\]

After choosing 2 out of 6 balls for child A, 4 balls are left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of these 4 for child B is:
\[
\binom{4}{3}
\]

The remaining 1 ball will go to child C automatically.

So, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two counts:

- Number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): 90
- Number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 over many rounds of the game.

So the answer is:

{case: 1}
