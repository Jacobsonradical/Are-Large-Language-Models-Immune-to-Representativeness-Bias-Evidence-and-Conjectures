To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls in each case.

**Case 1**: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2}
\]

Let's compute this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 4!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6
\]
So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90
\]

**Case 2**: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2 is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3}
\]

Let's compute this:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]
So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 = 60
\]

By comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that Case 1 has 90 possible distributions, while Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
