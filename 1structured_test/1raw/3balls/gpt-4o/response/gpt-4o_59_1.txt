To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case. 

First, let's compute the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 balls for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A: 2, B: 2, C: 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

Next, let's compute the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 balls for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A: 2, B: 3, C: 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
