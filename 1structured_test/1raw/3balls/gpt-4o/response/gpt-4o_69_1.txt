To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 over many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
3. The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

The number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 \]
\[ = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

The number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 \]
\[ = 60 \]

### Comparison
- For case 1, the number of ways is 90.
- For case 2, the number of ways is 60.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
