To answer which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more often, we need to compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed according to each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

In this case, each child gets exactly 2 balls. We need to count the number of ways to partition 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2.

The formula for partitioning n distinguishable items into r groups of given sizes \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r\) is given by:

\[ \frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \cdots a_r!} \]

Here, \(n = 6\) and \(a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 2\):

\[ \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to assign the balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

In this case, we need to count the number of ways to partition 6 distinguishable balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball. Here the order matters because distributing 2, 3, 1 is distinguishable from distributing 3, 2, 1, etc. Hence, we have:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \times 3! \]

First, select 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A, then select 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the final ball automatically goes to child C. Then multiply by \(3!\) to account for the different permutations of assigning A, B, and C.

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]
\[ 3! = 6 \]

So, the total number of ways is:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, there are 360 ways to assign the balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball.

Since 360 (case 2) is greater than 90 (case 1), case 2 will occur more often.

Therefore:
{case: 2}
