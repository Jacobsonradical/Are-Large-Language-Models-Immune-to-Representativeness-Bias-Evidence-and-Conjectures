Let's compute the probability of each case to determine which one is more likely to occur.

First, calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable children. Each ball can be given to any of the 3 children, so the total number of distributions is:
\[ 3^6 = 729. \]

Now, let's consider each case:

**Case 1: A: 2 balls, B: 2 balls, C: 2 balls.**

To achieve this distribution:
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to A. The number of ways to do this is given by \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. The number of ways to do this is given by \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- Give the remaining 2 balls to C. There is only 1 way to do this.

So, we compute:
\[ \begin{aligned}
\binom{6}{2} &= \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15, \\
\binom{4}{2} &= \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6.
\end{aligned} \]

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A: 2 balls, B: 3 balls, C: 1 ball.**

To achieve this distribution:
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to A. The number of ways to do this is given by \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. The number of ways to do this is given by \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- Give the remaining 1 ball to C. There is only 1 way to do this.

So, we compute:
\[ \begin{aligned}
\binom{6}{2} &= 15, \\
\binom{4}{3} &= \binom{4}{1} = 4.
\end{aligned} \]

Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case to occur:
- Case 1: 90 ways.
- Case 2: 60 ways.

Since 90 > 60, case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
