To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur given the 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A.
   \[
   \text{Ways} = \binom{6}{2}
   \]
2. Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
   \[
   \text{Ways} = \binom{4}{2}
   \]
3. The remaining 2 balls go to child C. The number of ways to choose these is fixed at 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A.
   \[
   \text{Ways} = \binom{6}{2}
   \]
2. Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
   \[
   \text{Ways} = \binom{4}{3}
   \]
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to child C. The number of ways to choose this is fixed at 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

By comparing the two cases:
- Number of ways for case 1: 90
- Number of ways for case 2: 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\{ \text{case}: 1 \}
\]
