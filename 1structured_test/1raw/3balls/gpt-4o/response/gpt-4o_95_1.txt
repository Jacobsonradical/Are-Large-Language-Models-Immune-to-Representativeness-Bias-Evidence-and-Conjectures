To determine which case will be more common, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each of the two cases.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets exactly 2 balls.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \({6 \choose 2}\) ways.
   \[{6 \choose 2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15\]

2. Second, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \({4 \choose 2}\) ways.
   \[{4 \choose 2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\]

3. The last 2 balls will automatically go to child C. This can be done in 1 way.

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve Case 1 is:
\[15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 3 balls, another gets 2 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball.

1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \({6 \choose 2}\) ways.
   \[{6 \choose 2} = 15 \]

2. Second, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \({4 \choose 3}\) ways.
   \[{4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4\]

3. The last ball will automatically go to child C. This can be done in 1 way.

We must consider the different orderings of which child gets 2, 3, and 1 balls. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign the roles of getting 2, 3, and 1 ball among A, B, and C.

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve Case 2 is:
\[15 \times 4 \times 1 \times 6 = 360\]

### Comparison
- Case 1 occurs in 90 ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 360 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**
\{case: 2\}
