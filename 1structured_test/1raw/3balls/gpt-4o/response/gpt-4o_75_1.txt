To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children, let's compute the probabilities for each case.

### Total Number of Permutations
First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children. Since each ball can go to any of the 3 children, the total number of permutations is:
\[ 3^6 \]

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To find the number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient. 

For case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
For case 2, we need to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. The number of ways this can happen is given by another multinomial coefficient.

For case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

### Normalizing for Total Permutations
There are \(3^6 = 729\) total ways to distribute the 6 balls. 

### Comparing Frequency
Now, let's compare the numbers we found for each case:
- Number of ways for case 1: \(90\)
- Number of ways for case 2: \(60\)

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{case}: 1 \} \]
