To determine if there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur. We can do this using the multinomial coefficient.

1. **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

2. **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

We need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the last gets 1 ball. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to achieve case 1 is 90, and the number of ways to achieve case 2 is 60. Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the final answer is:
{case: 1}
