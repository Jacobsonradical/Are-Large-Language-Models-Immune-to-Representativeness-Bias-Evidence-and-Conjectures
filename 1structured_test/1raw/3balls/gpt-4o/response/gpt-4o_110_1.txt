To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. This can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) way.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for case 1 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. The last ball automatically goes to child C. This is done in \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \) way.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparison:**

The number of ways for case 1 is 90.
The number of ways for case 2 is 60.

Since 90 is greater than 60, this means case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2 in many rounds of the game. 

Thus, the answer is:

\{case: 1\}
