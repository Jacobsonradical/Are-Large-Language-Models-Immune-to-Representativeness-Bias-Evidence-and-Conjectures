To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children in each of the described cases.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \cdot \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} \cdot \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60 \]

Now we compare the two results:

- Number of ways to achieve case 1: 90
- Number of ways to achieve case 2: 60

Because 90 > 60, case 1 will occur more often than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
