{case: 1}

**Reasoning**

The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is:
$$N = \binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{8}{2} = 28$$

Case 1 can happen in the following ways:
* A:2, B:2, C:2 (1 way)

Case 2 can happen in the following ways:
* A:2, B:3, C:1 (3 ways)
* A:3, B:2, C:1 (3 ways)
* A:1, B:2, C:3 (3 ways)

Therefore, case 1 will happen in **1** way out of 28, while case 2 will happen in **9** ways out of 28.

Hence, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
