There are 120 possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.
If two children receive 0 balls and the third one receives all 6, there are 3 ways to do so.
If two children receive 1 ball and the third one receives 4, there are 3 · 4 = 12 ways to do so.
If two children receive 2 balls and the third one receives 2, there are 3 · 3 = 9 ways to do so.
If two children receive 3 balls and the third one receives 0, there are 3 ways to do so.

Thus, there are 3 + 12 + 9 + 3 = 27 ways to distribute the 6 balls so that two children receive 2 balls each.
On the other hand, if two children receive 2 balls and the third one receives 1 ball, there are 3 · 4 = 12 ways to do so.
Thus, there are 12 ways to distribute the 6 balls so that two children receive 2 balls and one child receives 1 ball.

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the 6 balls so that two children receive 2 balls each than there are ways to distribute the 6 balls so that two children receive 2 balls and one child receives 1 ball.
