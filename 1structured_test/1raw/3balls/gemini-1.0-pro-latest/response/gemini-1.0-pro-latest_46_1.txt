{case: 2}

Reason:
To obtain case 1, we can either distribute 2 balls to A and then 2 to B or distribute 2 balls to A and then 2 to C. The number of ways to obtain case 1 is therefore (3C2) * (2C2) * (1C2) = 9. 

To obtain case 2, we can distribute 2 balls to A and the other 4 balls to B and C arbitrarily. The number of ways to obtain case 2 is therefore (3C2) * (4C3) = 18.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
