{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**

The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is:

(6 + 3 - 1)! / (6)! / (3 - 1)! = 7!/6!/2! = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21

The number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is:

(2 + 3 - 1)! / (2)! / (3 - 1)! / (2 + 3 - 1)! / (2)! / (3 - 1)! = 4!/2!/2! = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6

The number of ways to distribute the balls so that one child gets 3 balls and the other two children each get 1 ball is:

3 * (3 + 2 - 1)! / (3)! / (2 - 1)! / (3 + 2 - 1)! / (3)! / (2 - 1)! = 3 * 4!/3!/2! / 4!/3!/2! = 3 * 4 * 3 / 2 = 18

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (each child gets 2 balls) than case 2 (one child gets 3 balls and the other two children each get 1 ball).
