{case: 1}

**Proof**
The distribution can be regarded as a multinomial distribution. The total number of balls, \(n=6\), and the numbers of balls assigned to A, B, C are \(x_A=2\), \(x_B=2\), and \(x_C=2\) in case 1, and \(x_A=2\), \(x_B=3\), and \(x_C=1\) in case 2, respectively. The numbers of possible ways to distribute the balls are
$$\frac{n!}{x_A!x_B!x_C!} =\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}=90$$

and

$$\frac{n!}{x_A!x_B!x_C!} =\frac{6!}{2!3!1!}=60$$

respectively. 

Therefore, case 1 has more results.
