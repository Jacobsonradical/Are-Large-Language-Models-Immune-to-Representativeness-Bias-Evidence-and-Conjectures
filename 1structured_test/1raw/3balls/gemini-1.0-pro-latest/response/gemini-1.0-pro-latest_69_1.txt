{case: 1}

**Reasoning**: 
There are a total of 20 possible outcomes in each round of the game.

In case 1, there is only 1 outcome: A:2, B:2, C:2.

In case 2, there are 6 outcomes: A:2, B:3, C:1; A:3, B:2, C:1; A:2, B:1, C:3; A:1, B:3, C:2; A:1, B:2, C:3; A:3, B:1, C:2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
