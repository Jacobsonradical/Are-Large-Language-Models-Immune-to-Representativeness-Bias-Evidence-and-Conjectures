{case: 1}

Reasoning:

To find the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed as in case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for each of the three children from a total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 ways.

To find the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed as in case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B and 1 ball for child C from a total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 ways.

**Case 1 has more possibilities.**
