 There are 10 possible ways in which six different balls can be distributed among three children, two each (one for each child):

{1,2; 3,4; 5,6}
{1,3; 2,4; 5,6}
{1,4; 2,3; 5,6}
{1,5; 2,3; 4,6}
{1,6; 2,3; 4,5}
{1,2; 3,5; 4,6}
{1,2; 3,6; 4,5}
{1,3; 2,5; 4,6}
{1,3; 2,6; 4,5}
{1,4; 2,5; 3,6}

There is only one way in which these six balls can be distributed among three children in such a way that one child gets two balls and the others get three balls each:

{1,2; 3,4,5; 6}
