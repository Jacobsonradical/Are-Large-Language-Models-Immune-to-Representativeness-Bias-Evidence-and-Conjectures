{case: 1}

**Explanation**:

The balls can be distributed among the three children in the following ways:
(2,2,2)
(3,2,1)
(3,1,2)
(2,3,1)
(2,1,3)
(1,3,2)
(1,2,3)
(1,1,4)
(4,1,1)
(4,0,2)
(2,4,0)
(0,4,2)
(0,2,4)
(4,2,0)
(0,0,6)

In case 1, there is only one way: (2,2,2)

In case 2, there are six ways: (3,2,1), (3,1,2), (2,3,1), (2,1,3), (1,3,2), (1,2,3)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
