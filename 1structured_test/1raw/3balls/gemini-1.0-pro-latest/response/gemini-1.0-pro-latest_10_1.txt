{case: 1}

**Reasoning**:
First, we calculate the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children:

```
Total ways = (6+3-1)!/(6!*(3-1)!) = 20
```

Now, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1:

```
Case 1 ways = (2!/(2!*2!*2!)) * 20 = 10
```

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2:

```
Case 2 ways = (2!/(2!*3!*1!)) * 20 = 10
```

Therefore, the number of results of case 1 will be equal to the number of results of case 2.
