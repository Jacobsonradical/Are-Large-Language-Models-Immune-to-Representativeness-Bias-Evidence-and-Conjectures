{case: 1}
Explanation:
According to the binomial distribution, in many rounds, the number of results of case 1 is:
$$p(x=2) = \frac{6!}{2! 2! 2!} * (1/3)^2 *(2/3)^4 = 0.3241$$

and the number of results of case 2 is:
$$p(x=3) = \frac{6!}{2! 3! 1!} * (1/3)^3 *(2/3)^3 = 0.2161$$

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1.
