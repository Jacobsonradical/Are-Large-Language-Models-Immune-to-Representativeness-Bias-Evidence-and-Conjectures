{case: 1}

**Reasoning**

There are 20 possible outcomes of the distribution of the 6 balls among three children:

Outcome | Balls for A | Balls for B | Balls for C |
------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
1 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
2 | 0 | 1 | 5 |
3 | 0 | 2 | 4 |
4 | 0 | 3 | 3 |
5 | 0 | 4 | 2 |
6 | 0 | 5 | 1 |
7 | 0 | 6 | 0 |
8 | 1 | 0 | 5 |
9 | 1 | 1 | 4 |
10 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
**11 | 1 | 3 | 2 |**
12 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
13 | 1 | 5 | 0 |
14 | 2 | 0 | 4 |
**15 | 2 | 1 | 3 |**
**16 | 2 | 2 | 2 |**
17 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
18 | 2 | 4 | 0 |
19 | 3 | 0 | 3 |
20 | 3 | 1 | 2 |

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) corresponds to outcome 16, while case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1) corresponds to outcome 11.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
