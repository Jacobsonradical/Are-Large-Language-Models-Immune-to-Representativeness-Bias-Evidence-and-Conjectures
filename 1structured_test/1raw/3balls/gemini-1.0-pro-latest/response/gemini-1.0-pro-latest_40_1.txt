{case: 1}

**Case 1:** There are 6C2 = 15 ways for child A to get 2 balls out of 6, and the remaining 4 balls can be distributed in 4C2 = 6 ways to get 2 for child B and 2 for child C. So there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways to get case 1.

**Case 2:** There are 6C2 = 15 ways for child A to get 2 balls out of 6, then there are 4 balls left. Child B can get 3 balls out of the 4 balls in 4C3 = 4 ways, leaving 1 ball for child C. So there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways to get case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be **more results of case 1**.
