{case: 2}

Suppose A gets m balls while B and C get a and b balls respectively. Then m + a + b = 6. For case 1 to occur, we need m = 2 and a = b = 2. For case 2 to occur, we need m = 2 and a = 3 and b = 1, or m = 3 and a = 1 and b = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1 and as a result, case 2 is more likely to happen.
