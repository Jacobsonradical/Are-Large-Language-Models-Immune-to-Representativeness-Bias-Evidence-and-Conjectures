{case: 1}

Reasoning:

In order to distribute balls among 3 children in such a way that each child receives at least one ball, we need to first distribute one ball to each child. This leaves us with 3 balls to distribute.

In case 1, we distribute the remaining 3 balls among the three children uniformly, which gives us the following possibilities:
{(2,1,0), (1,2,0), (1,1,1)}

In case 2, we give one ball to one child and two balls to another child. Since the balls are distinguishable, we need to consider the following three possibilities:
{(2,2,0), (2,1,1), (1,2,1)}

Therefore, there are 3 possibilities for case 1 and 3 possibilities for case 2. Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
