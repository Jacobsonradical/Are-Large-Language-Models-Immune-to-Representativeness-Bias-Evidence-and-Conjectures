{case: 2}

Reasoning:
For case 1 to happen, two balls must go to A first, then two to B, and then two to C. The probability of this happening is:

P(case 1) = (1/3)^2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/1) = 1/36

For case 2 to happen, two balls must go to A first, then two or three to B, and then two or one to C. The probability of this happening is:

P(case 2) = (1/3)^2 * (1/2) * (3/3) = 3/36

Therefore, case 2 is more likely to happen than case 1.
