{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children so that each child gets 2 balls is given by:

```
(6! / (2!2!2!)) = 15
```

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children so that one child gets 2 balls, one child gets 3 balls, and one child gets 1 ball is given by:

```
(6! / (2!3!1!)) = 60
```

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
