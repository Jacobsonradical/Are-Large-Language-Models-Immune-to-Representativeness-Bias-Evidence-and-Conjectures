{case: 1}

Reasoning:

In case 1, there are 10 possible outcomes:

(2,2,2), (2,2,1,1), (2,1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,2,2), (1,2,1,2), (1,2,2,1), (2,1,2,1), (2,1,1,2), (1,2,1,1,2)

In case 2, there are 15 possible outcomes:

(2,3,1), (3,2,1), (2,1,3), (3,1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,2,1,1), (2,1,2,1), (2,1,1,2), (1,2,2,1), (1,2,1,2), (1,1,2,2), (1,2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,2,1), (1,1,1,1,2)

Therefore, the possible outcomes of case 1 is smaller than that of case 2, so case 1 outcomes will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
