{case: 1}

Reasoning:

First, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1, since each child gets 2 balls, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2, since A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Now, let's compare the two cases. We can see that the number of possible outcomes for case 1 is 90, while the number of possible outcomes for case 2 is 60. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
