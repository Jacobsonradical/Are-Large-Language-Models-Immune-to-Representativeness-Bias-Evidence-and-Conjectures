{case: 2}

**Reasoning:**

To compute the probability of each case, we can use the multinomial distribution.

For case 1, the probability is:

P(case 1) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) / 3^6 = 1/10

For case 2, the probability is:

P(case 2) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) / 3^6 = 3/10

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2.
