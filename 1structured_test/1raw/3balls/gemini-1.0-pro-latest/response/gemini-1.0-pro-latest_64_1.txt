{case: 1}

We can use the formula for multinomial coefficients to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: There are 6! / (2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls.

Case 2: There are 6! / (2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the balls so that one child gets 2 balls, one child gets 3 balls, and the other child gets 1 ball.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
