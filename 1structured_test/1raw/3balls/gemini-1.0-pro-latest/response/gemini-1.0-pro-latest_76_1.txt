{case: 1}
**Reasoning**:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each child gets at least one ball is:
3 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 360

Case 1: There are 2 * 3 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 48 ways to distribute 2 balls to each child.

Case 2: There are 2 * 3 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 144 ways to distribute 3 balls to one child, 2 balls to another, and 1 ball to the last child.

Therefore, the number of outcomes of case 1 is less than the number of outcomes of case 2, and in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
