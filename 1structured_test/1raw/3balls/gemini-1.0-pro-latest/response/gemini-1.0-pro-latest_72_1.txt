{case: 1}

**Reasoning and computation**

To find which case is more likely to occur, we can compute the number of ways each case is possible.

**Case 1:**

To get a distribution of A:2, B:2, C:2, we need to first select 2 balls to give to child A from the total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways. Then, we need to select 2 balls to give to child B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in 4C2 = 6 ways. Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. So, the total number of ways to get a distribution of A:2, B:2, C:2 is 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

**Case 2:**

To get a distribution of A:2, B:3, C:1, we need to first select 2 balls to give to child A from the total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways. Then, we need to select 3 balls to give to child B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in 4C3 = 4 ways. Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. So, the total number of ways to get a distribution of A:2, B:3, C:1 is 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

**Conclusion:**

Since there are more ways to get a distribution of A:2, B:2, C:2 (90 ways) than there are ways to get a distribution of A:2, B:3, C:1 (60 ways), case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
