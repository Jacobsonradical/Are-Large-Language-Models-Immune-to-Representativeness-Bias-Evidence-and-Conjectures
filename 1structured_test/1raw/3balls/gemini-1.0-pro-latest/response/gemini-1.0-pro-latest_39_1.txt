{case: 1}

Each ball have three choices and total 6 distinguishable balls, so in each round of the game, there are total 3^6 = 729 possible results.

For case 1, two balls can be allocated to child A in 6C2 = 15 ways; then two balls can be allocated to child B in 6C2 = 15 ways;  then the last two balls must go to child C. So there are 15 * 15 = 225 results of case 1.

For case 2, two balls can be allocated to child A in 6C2 = 15 ways; then three balls can be allocated to child B in 6C3 = 20 ways;  then the last one ball must go to child C. So there are 15 * 20 = 300 results of case 2.

So there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
