{case: 2}

Reasoning:

Given 6 balls and 3 children, the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets at least one ball is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
(Explanation: Choose 2 balls for the first child in C(6, 2) ways, then choose 2 balls for the second child in C(4, 2) ways, and the remaining 2 balls go to the third child.)

Out of these 90 distributions, only 1 distribution is case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

The number of ways to distribute the balls such that one child gets 3 balls and the other two get 1 ball each is:

C(6, 3) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 1) * 2 = 20 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 240
(Explanation: Choose 3 balls for one child in C(6, 3) ways. Then choose 1 ball for the second child in C(3, 1) ways, and 1 ball for the third child in C(2, 1) ways. Finally, multiply by 2 because the second and third child can get 1 ball in two different orders.)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
