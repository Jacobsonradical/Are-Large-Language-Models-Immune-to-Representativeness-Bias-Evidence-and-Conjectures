{case: 1}

Each round of the game, the total number of possible combinations is 
$${15\choose 5}={15\times14\times 13 \times 12 \times 11\over 5\times 4\times 3 \times 2\times 1}=3003$$

Let's first compute the number of combinations of case 1:

for A, the number of combinations is 
$${6\choose 2}=15$$

for B, the number of combinations is also 
$${6\choose 2}=15$$

for C, the number of combinations is also 
$${6\choose 2}=15$$

Therefore, the number of combinations of case 1 is 
$$15\times 15\times 15=3375$$

Secondly, let's compute the number of combinations of case 2:

for A, the number of combinations is still 
$${6\choose 2}=15$$

for B, the number of combinations is 
$${6\choose 2}={6\times 5\over 2\times 1}=15$$

for C, the number of combinations is 
$${6\choose 1}={6\over 1}=6$$

Therefore, the number of combinations of case 2 is 
$$15\times 15\times 6=1350$$
 
Since 3375 > 1350, for many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
