{case: 2}

**Reasoning:**
There are 20 possible outcomes of how the balls could be distributed among the three children. The total number of balls is 6. So the number of ways the balls could be distributed so that each child gets 2 balls is 6!/2!2!2! = 15. The number of ways the balls could be distributed so that one child gets 3 balls and the other two children each get 1 ball is 6!/3!1!1!2! = 5. Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
