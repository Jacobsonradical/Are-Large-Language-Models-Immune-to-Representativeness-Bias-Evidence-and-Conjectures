{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**

In case 1, there are 9 ways to distribute the balls:

    AABBCC
    AABBBC
    AABCCB
    ABBACC
    ABCBAC
    ABCCAB
    ACABAB
    ACBBAC
    ACCABB

In case 2, there are 18 ways to distribute the balls:

    AABBCC
    AABBBC
    AABCCB
    ABBACC
    ABCBAC
    ABCCAB
    ACABAB
    ACBBAC
    ACCABB

    AAABBC
    AABBBC
    AACBCC
    AABCBC
    ACABBB
    AACCBB
    ABABCC
    ABBBAC
    ABBCCC

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
