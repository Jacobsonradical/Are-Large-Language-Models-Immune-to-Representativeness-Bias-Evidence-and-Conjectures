{case: 1}

Reasoning:
The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 20 * 19 * 18 = 6840.

For case 1, there are 10 ways to distribute the balls:
(2,2,2), (2,2,1,1), (2,1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1,1)
For each way, there are 6! = 720 ways to permute the balls among the children.
So there are 10 * 720 = 7200 ways to get case 1.

For case 2, there are 15 ways to distribute the balls:
(2,3,1), (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (3,1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2),
(2,2,1,1), (2,1,2,1), (2,1,1,2), (1,2,2,1), (1,1,2,2),
(1,2,1,2), (1,1,1,2,1), (1,1,1,1,2), (1,1,1,1,1,1)
For each way, there are 6! = 720 ways to permute the balls among the children.
So there are 15 * 720 = 10800 ways to get case 2.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
