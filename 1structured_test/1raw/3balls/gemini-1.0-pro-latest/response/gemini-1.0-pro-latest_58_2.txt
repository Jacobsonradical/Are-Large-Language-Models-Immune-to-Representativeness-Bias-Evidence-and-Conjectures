{case: 1}

Reasoning:
First, we calculate the number of outcomes for each case.
For case 1, where each child gets two balls, there is only one possible outcome.
For case 2, where one child gets three balls and the other two get one ball each, there are three possible outcomes (A gets 3 balls, B gets 3 balls, C gets 3 balls).

Next, we determine the probability of each case occurring.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 1/20, since there is only one possible outcome out of 20 possible outcomes (6 balls distributed among 3 children).
The probability of case 2 occurring is 3/20, since there are three possible outcomes out of 20 possible outcomes.

Since the probability of case 2 occurring is greater than the probability of case 1 occurring, we can conclude that case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
