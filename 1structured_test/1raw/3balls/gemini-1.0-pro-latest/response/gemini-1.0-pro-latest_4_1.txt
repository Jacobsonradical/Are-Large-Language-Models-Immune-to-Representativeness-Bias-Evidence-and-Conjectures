{case: 2}

**Reasoning**:
There are 3^6 =729 possible arrangements of the balls among the three children.

Case 1: There are 9 ways to give each child 2 balls (3 choose 1, 3 choose 1, 3 choose 1).
Hence, case 1 occurs in 9/729 * 100 ≈ 1.2% of the time.

Case 2: There are 27 ways to give 2 balls to child A, and 3 balls to child B, then 1 ball to child C (3 choose 2, 3 choose 1, 3 choose 1).
Hence, case 2 occurs in 27/729 * 100 ≈ 3.7% of the time.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 will occur more often than case 1.
