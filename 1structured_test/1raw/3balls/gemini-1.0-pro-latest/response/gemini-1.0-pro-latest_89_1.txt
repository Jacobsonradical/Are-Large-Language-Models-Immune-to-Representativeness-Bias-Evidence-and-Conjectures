{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**

There are 20 possible outcomes for case 1:

```
AABBBC, AABBCC, AACCBB, BBCCAA, BBCCAA, BBCCAA, CCCAAA, CCAABB, CCBBAA, CBBCAA
BCAABC, BCACBA, CABABC, CABBCA, CBABCA, CBACBA, ACBABC, ACABBA, ABACBA, ABACBA
```

There are 30 possible outcomes for case 2:

```
AABBC, AABCB, AABCC, ABACB, ABACC, ABACB, ACABB, ACABC, ACBBA
BAABC, BAACB, BAACC, BBACA, BBACB, BBCCB, BCABA, BCACB, BCABB
CBAAB, CBAAC, CBBAA, CBACA, CBCAA, CBACB, CABAAB, CABAC, CABBA
```

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
