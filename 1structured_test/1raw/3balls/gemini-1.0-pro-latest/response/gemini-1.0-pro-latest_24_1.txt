{case: 1}

**Reasoning:**
In case 1, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls among the children (5 identical ways for A, 5 identical ways for B, and 12 non-identical ways for C).

In case 2, there are 120 ways to distribute the balls (5 identical ways for A, 10 identical ways for B, and 24 non-identical ways for C).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
