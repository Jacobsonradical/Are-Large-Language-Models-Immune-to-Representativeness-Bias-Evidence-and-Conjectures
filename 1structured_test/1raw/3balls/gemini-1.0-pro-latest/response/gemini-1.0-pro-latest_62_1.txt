{case: 1}

Reasoning:
There are $20$ possible distributions among $3$ children:
* $6$ ways: $3$ to one, $2$ to another, $1$ to the last one.
* $4$ ways: $3$ to one, $2$ to another, $0$ to the last one.
* $10$ ways: $2$ to each.

So there are $10$ ways for case 1 and $6$ ways for case 2, so there will be more results of case 1.
