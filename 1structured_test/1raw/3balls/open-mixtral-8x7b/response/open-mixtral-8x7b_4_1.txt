To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls are given to A, which is C(6, 2) = 15 (where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time).

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls are given to A and which 1 ball is given to C, which is C(6, 2) \* C(4, 1) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 than in Case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
