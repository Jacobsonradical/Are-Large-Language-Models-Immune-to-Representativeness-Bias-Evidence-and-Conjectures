To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

In case 1, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls (6), and n1, n2, n3 are the numbers of balls received by children A, B, and C, respectively.

So for case 1, we have:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

For case 2, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1. Using the same formula, we have:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case. We have:

Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways for case 1 than case 2, it is more likely that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
