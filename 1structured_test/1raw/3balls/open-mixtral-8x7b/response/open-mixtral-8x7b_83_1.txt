To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we want to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6![Number of ways to distribute the balls]) / (2![Number of balls given to A]) * (2![Number of balls given to B]) * (2![Number of balls given to C])

= (6!/(2!2!2!))

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6![Number of ways to distribute the balls]) / (2![Number of balls given to A]) * (3![Number of balls given to B]) * (1![Number of balls given to C])

= 6!/(2!3!1!)

Now, we need to compare the number of ways in each case:

Number of ways in Case 1 = 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15
Number of ways in Case 2 = 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 2 to occur than Case 1, the answer is:

{case: 2}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.
