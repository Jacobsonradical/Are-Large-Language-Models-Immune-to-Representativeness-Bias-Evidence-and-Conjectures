To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with 2, 3, and 1 balls going to A, B, and C, respectively. The number of ways to do this is given by:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls according to case 1 than case 2 (90 vs. 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
