To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, C each get 2 balls.
There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!]

where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, for Case 1, we have:

C(6, 2) = 6! / [(6-2)!2!] = 720 / [4!2!] = 720 / [24*2] = 15

There are 15 ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, C gets 1 ball.
We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with the constraint that B gets 3 balls and C gets 1 ball. The problem simplifies to distributing 2 balls (the ones that A gets) among 3 children. The number of ways to do this is:

C(2, 2) = 2! / [(2-2)!2!] = 2

However, for each of these distributions of the 2 balls to A, B, and C, there are C(5, 3) = 10 ways to distribute the remaining 3 balls among B and C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:

2 * 10 = 20

So, comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in Case 2 than in Case 1:

{case: 2}
