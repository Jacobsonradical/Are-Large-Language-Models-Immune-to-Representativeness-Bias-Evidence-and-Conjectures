To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls for child C. This can be calculated using combinations as follows:

number of ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (2! \* 2!)) * (2! / (2! \* 0!))
= (15) * (6) * (1)
= 90

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This means that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball for child C. This can be calculated using combinations as follows:

number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (3! \* 1!)) * (1! / (1! \* 0!))
= (15) * (4) * (1)
= 60

Now, we can compare the number of ways for each case:

number of ways for case 1 = 90
number of ways for case 2 = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 than case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
