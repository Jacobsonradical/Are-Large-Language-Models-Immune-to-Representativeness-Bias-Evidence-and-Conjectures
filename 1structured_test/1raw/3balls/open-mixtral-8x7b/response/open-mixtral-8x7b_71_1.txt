To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose which 2 balls A receives, which is C(6,2) = 15 (where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time).

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. There are C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose which 2 balls A receives, and then there are C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose which 3 balls B receives. However, once we have chosen which balls A and B receive, the ball that C receives is determined, so there is only 1 way to choose which ball C receives. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, we see that there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, and only 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
