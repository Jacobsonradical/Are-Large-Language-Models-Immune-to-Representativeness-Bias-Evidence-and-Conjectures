To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to see which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n distinguishable objects among k groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of objects in each group, and n = n1 + n2 + ... + nk.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and only 60 ways in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
