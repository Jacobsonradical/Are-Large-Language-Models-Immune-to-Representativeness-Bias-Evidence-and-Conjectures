To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with 2 balls each:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

So there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in a similar way:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

So there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Comparing the two results, we can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
