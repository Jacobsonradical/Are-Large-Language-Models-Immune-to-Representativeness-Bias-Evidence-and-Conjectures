To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We will use the stars and bars method to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. In this method, we treat the balls as identical stars and use bars to separate the balls given to each child. For example, the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 would be represented as **|*|*|*|*. There are a total of 6 stars and 2 bars, making a sequence of 8 symbols. The number of ways to distribute the balls is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange these 8 symbols, which is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of symbols (8 in this case), and k is the number of bars (2 in this case). Plugging in the values, we get:

C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, for this case, we have 6 stars and 2 bars, making a sequence of 8 symbols. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28

Comparing the results for the two cases, we find that both cases have the same number of ways to distribute the balls, i.e., 28. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be an equal number of results for case 1 and case 2.
