To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

There are 6 balls to distribute, and 3 children, so we need to choose 2 balls to give to each child. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial. So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * (2!/(2!0!)) = (15) * (6) * (1) = 90

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(3!1!)) * (1!/(1!0!)) = (15) * (4) * (1) = 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
