To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these values.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method. There are (6+3-1) choose (3-1) = 28 ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, using the stars-and-bars method, we find that there are (6+3-1) choose (3-1) = 28 ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Since the number of ways to distribute the balls is the same for both cases, we will see approximately the same number of results for case 1 and case 2 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: "either 1 or 2", equal: true}
