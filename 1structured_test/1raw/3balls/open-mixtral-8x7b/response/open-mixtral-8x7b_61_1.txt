To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

The total number of balls is 6, and there are 3 children (A, B, C). We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls, and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls distributed to children A, B, and C, respectively.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls distributed among 3 children, with 2 balls for each child:

Number of ways for case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 6 balls distributed among 3 children, with 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C:

Number of ways for case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Now that we have calculated the number of ways for both cases, we can compare them:

{case: 1}

There will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), with 90 ways, compared to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), with 60 ways.
