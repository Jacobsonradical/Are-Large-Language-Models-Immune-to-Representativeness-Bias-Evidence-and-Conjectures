To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 for child B, and the remaining 2 for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 2) x (2 choose 2) = 15 x 6 x 1 = 90

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 3) x (1 choose 1) = 15 x 4 x 1 = 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2 (case 1) than as A:2, B:3, C:1 (case 2). Therefore, we expect to see more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
