To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls to distribute, and each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, there are 6 balls to distribute. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 360

Therefore, there are 360 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2, which is more than the 90 ways for Case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2}
