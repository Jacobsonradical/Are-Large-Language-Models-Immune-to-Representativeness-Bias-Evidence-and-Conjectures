To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls to distribute, and each child gets 2. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to do this is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 (case 2) is less than 90 (case 1), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
