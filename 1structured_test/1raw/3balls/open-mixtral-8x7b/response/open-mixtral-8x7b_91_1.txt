To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to distribute n balls into k boxes with respective counts of balls given by the vector (n1, n2, ..., nk) is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of balls (in this case, 6) and ! denotes the factorial function.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 than case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
