To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2. We can choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A in C(6,2) ways, which is equal to 15 ways. After giving 2 balls to child A, we are left with 4 balls, and we need to divide them equally between children B and C. We can do this in 3 ways (by giving 2 balls to child B and 2 to child C, or 1 ball to each of B and C and 2 to the other child, or vice versa). Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 * 3 = 45 ways.

In case 2, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1. We can choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A in C(6,2) ways, which is equal to 15 ways. After giving 2 balls to child A, we are left with 4 balls, and we need to distribute them as B:3, C:1. We can choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B in C(4,3) ways, which is equal to 4 ways. After giving 3 balls to child B, we are left with 1 ball, which we give to child C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for case 2 (60 ways) than for case 1 (45 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {case: 2}
