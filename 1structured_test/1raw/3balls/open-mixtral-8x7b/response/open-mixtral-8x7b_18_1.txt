To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

In case 1, we have A:2, B:2, C:2. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! \* n2! \* ... \* nk!)

where n is the total number of balls, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of balls given to each child, and ! denotes factorial.

So in this case, n = 6, n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, and the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 15

In case 2, we have A:2, B:3, C:1. Using the same formula, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60 / (2 \* 6) = 5

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (15 ways) than in case 2 (5 ways).
