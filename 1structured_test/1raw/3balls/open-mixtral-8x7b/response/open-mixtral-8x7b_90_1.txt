To solve this problem, we need to use the multinomial coefficient formula, which gives the number of ways to distribute n objects into k containers with given quantities for each container. The formula is:

C(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of objects, n1, n2, ..., nk are the quantities for each container, and ! denotes the factorial function.

In our case, we have n = 6 balls and k = 3 children. We want to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, and compare this number for the cases when child B gets 2 balls and when child B gets 3 balls.

For case 1, where child B also gets 2 balls, we have:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, where child B gets 3 balls, we have:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two numbers, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls and child B gets 2 balls (90 ways) than such that child A gets 2 balls and child B gets 3 balls (60 ways). Therefore, we expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Hence, our answer is:

{case: 1}
