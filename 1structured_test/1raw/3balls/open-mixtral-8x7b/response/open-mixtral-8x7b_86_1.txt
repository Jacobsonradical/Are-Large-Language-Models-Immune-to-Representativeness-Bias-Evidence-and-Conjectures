To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C. The number of ways to do this is:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 2) x (2 choose 2) = 15 x 6 x 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C. The number of ways to do this is:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 3) x (1 choose 1) = 15 x 4 x 1 = 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
