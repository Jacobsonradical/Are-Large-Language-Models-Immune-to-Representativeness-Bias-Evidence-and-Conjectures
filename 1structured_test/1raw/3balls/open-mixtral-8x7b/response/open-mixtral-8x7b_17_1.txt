To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children, with 2 balls going to each child. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!)) \* (3!) = 90

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. Again, we can use the multinomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

(6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!)) \* (3!) = 60

Comparing these two numbers, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). Therefore, we expect to see more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
