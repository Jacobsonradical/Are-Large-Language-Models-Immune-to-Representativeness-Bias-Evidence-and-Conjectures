To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to each child. This can be calculated using combinations:

number of ways (case 1) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (2! \* 2!)) * (2! / (2! \* 0!))
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B, and 1 ball out of the remaining 1 to give to C. This can be calculated as:

number of ways (case 2) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (3! \* 1!)) * (1! / (1! \* 0!))
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways), it is more likely that the balls will be distributed in case 1 than in case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
