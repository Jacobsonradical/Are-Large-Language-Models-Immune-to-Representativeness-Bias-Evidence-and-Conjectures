To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls and 3 children, and each child gets 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls, and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls distributed to children A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, n=6, n1=n2=n3=2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

To compare the number of ways that each case can occur, we can compute the ratio of the two numbers:

90 / 60 = 3/2

This means that there are 3 times as many ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 as there are in Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
