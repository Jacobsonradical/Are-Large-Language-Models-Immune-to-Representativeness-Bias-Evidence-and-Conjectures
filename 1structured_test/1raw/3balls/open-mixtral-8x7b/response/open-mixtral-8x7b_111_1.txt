To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the formula:

n+m-1 choose n

Using this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6+3-1 choose 6 = 8 choose 6 = 28
