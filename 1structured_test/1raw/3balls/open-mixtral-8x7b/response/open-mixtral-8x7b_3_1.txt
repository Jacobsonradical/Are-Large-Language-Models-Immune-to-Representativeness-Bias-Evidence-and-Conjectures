To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n

(n choose n1, n2, ..., nm) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child, and n! denotes n factorial (n times the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n).

In case 1, we have A:2, B:2, C:2. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 180 / 8 = 30

In case 2, we have A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / 12 = 60

Therefore, case 2 is more likely than case 1, since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2. Specifically, there are 60 possible distributions for case 2, compared to 30 possible distributions for case 1.

So the answer is:

{case: 2}
