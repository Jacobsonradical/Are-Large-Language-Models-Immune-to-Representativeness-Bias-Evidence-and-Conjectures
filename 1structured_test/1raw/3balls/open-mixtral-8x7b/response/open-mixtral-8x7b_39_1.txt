To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have:
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls for child B: C(4, 2) = 6
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls for child C: C(2, 2) = 1

Total ways for case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B: C(6, 3) = 20
- Number of ways to choose 1 ball for child C: C(3, 1) = 3

Total ways for case 2: 15 * 20 * 3 = 900

Comparing the total ways for both cases, we see that there are more results of case 2 than case 1:

{case: 2}
