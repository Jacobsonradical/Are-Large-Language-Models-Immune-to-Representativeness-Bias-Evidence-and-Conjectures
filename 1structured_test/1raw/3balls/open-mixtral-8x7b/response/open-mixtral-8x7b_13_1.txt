To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

In case 1, the balls can be distributed as (2,2,2), where the first number represents the number of balls child A gets, the second number represents the number of balls child B gets, and the third number represents the number of balls child C gets. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) \* (2 choose 2) / (3!) = 15

In case 2, the balls can be distributed as (2,3,1). The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) / (3!) = 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are many more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
