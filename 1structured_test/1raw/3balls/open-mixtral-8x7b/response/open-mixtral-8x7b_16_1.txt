To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls for child C. This can be calculated as follows:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (2! \* 2!)) * (2! / (2! \* 0!))
= 90

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. This means that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball for child C. This can be calculated as follows:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
= (6! / (2! \* 4!)) * (4! / (3! \* 1!)) * (1! / (1! \* 0!))
= 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
