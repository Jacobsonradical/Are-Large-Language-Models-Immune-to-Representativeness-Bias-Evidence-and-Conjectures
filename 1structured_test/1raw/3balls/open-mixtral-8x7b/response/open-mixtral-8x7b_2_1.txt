To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and compare them.

In case 1, A, B, and C each get 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 2, and C gets 2, is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) / (2! \* 2!) = 15

In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1, is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) / (2! \* 3!) = 10

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 and case 2, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in case 1 (15) than in case 2 (10). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2. So, our answer is:

{case: 1}
