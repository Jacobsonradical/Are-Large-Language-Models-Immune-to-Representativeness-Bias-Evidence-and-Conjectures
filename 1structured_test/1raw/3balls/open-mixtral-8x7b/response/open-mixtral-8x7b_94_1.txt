To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we want to divide among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

multinomial(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category, and ! denotes factorial.

So in this case, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 / (2 * 6) = 5

Now let's compare the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 15 ways
Case 2: 5 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2, since there are 3 times as many ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 than in case 2.

Answer: {case: 1, reason: "there are 3 times as many ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 than in case 2"}
