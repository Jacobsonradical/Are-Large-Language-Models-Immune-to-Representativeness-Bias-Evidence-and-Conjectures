To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we want to divide into 3 groups of 2. This is a classic stars-and-bars problem, which can be solved using combinations. The number of ways to divide the balls is:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) / (2!) = 15 * 6 / 2 = 45

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 6 balls that we want to divide into 3 groups of 2, 3, and 1. The number of ways to divide the balls is:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1!) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for Case 2 (60) than for Case 1 (45). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.
