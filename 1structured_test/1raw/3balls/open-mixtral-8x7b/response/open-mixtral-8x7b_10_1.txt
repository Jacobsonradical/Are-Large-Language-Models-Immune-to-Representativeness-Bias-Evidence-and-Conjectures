To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we want to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, we use the multinomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 180

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are twice as many ways for the balls to be distributed as in Case 2 than in Case 1:

Number of ways for Case 1: 90
Number of ways for Case 2: 180

Therefore, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1:

{case: 2}
