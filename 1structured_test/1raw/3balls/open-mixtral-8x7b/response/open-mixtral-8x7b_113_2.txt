To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and compare them.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) \* (2 choose 2) / (3 choose 1)^3 = 15

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) / (3 choose 1)^2 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (60 ways) than in case 1 (15 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
