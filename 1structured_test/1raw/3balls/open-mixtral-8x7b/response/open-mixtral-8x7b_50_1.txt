To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of balls, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of balls received by each child, and k is the number of children.

In this case, n = 6, n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, and k = 3. So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. Using the same formula as above, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 / (2 * 6) = 5

Therefore, there are 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 1, and 5 ways to distribute the balls in case 2. So there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1, frequency: more}
