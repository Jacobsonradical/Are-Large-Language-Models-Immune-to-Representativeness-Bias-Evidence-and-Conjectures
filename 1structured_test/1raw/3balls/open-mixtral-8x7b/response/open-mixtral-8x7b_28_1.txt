To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls to be distributed among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. This is equivalent to distributing 3 balls among the 3 children, with each child getting 1 ball. The number of ways to do this is given by the combinations formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to be distributed, k is the number of items to be received by each child, and "!" denotes factorial.

Using the formula, we get C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 4!) = 15 ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Here, we need to distribute 5 balls among the 3 children, with 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. The number of ways to do this is given by C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) = 15 \* 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more ways (60) to distribute the balls according to Case 2 than there are ways (15) to distribute them according to Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
