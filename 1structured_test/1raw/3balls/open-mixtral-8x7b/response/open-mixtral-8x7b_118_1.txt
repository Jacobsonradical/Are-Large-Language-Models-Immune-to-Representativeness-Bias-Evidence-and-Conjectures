To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. This is a case of "stars and bars" distribution, where we have 6 "stars" (the balls) and need to divide them into 3 groups (the children) using 2 "bars." The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n+k-1, k-1), where n is the number of stars and k is the number of bars.

In this case, n=6 and k=3, so the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Again, we have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, but this time with different numbers of balls for each child. We can use the multinomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case:

Multinomial(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! \* n2! \* ... \* nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of each type of item, and ! denotes factorial.

In this case, n=6, n1=2, n2=3, and n3=1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:

Multinomial(6; 2,3,1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 720 / (2 \* 6 \* 1) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is less likely than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), since there are fewer ways for the balls to be distributed in Case 1 (28) than in Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
