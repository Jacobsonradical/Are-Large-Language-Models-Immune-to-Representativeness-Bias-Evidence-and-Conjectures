To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

In case 1, we need to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, such that each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

In case 2, we need to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, such that one child gets 1 ball, one child gets 2 balls, and the third child gets 3 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 1, 2, 3) = 6! / (1! \* 2! \* 3!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (with each child getting 2 balls) than in case 2 (with children getting 1, 2, and 3 balls). To be precise, there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur and 60 ways for case 2 to occur, so the ratio of case 1 to case 2 is 3:2.

Answer: {case: 1}
