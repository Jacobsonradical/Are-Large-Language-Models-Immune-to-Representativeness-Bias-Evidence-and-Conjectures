To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is equivalent to choosing 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls, then giving the remaining 4 balls to children B and C. This can be calculated using combinations:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

The number of ways to distribute the balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball can be calculated as follows:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
