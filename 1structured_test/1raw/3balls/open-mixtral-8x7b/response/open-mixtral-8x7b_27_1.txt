To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to distribute n balls into k boxes with distributions specified by non-negative integers n_1, n_2, ..., n_k is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!)

Here, n = 6 (the total number of balls), k = 3 (the number of children), and the n_i's are the numbers of balls received by each child. 

For case 1, the number of distributions is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90.
For case 2, the number of distributions is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total number of possible distributions in one round of the game. Since each ball can go to any of the 3 children, there are 3^6 = 729 possible distributions.

To compare the frequencies of case 1 and case 2, we can calculate the ratio of their probabilities:

P(case 1) / P(case 2) = (Number of distributions in case 1) / (Total number of distributions) * (Probability of selecting case 1) / (Probability of selecting case 2)

Given that we are interested in the long-term behavior of the game, we can assume that all distributions are equally likely. The probability of selecting any specific distribution is then 1/729. 

The probability of selecting case 1 is the number of distributions in case 1 divided by the total number of distributions, which is 90/729.

Similarly, the probability of selecting case 2 is the number of distributions in case 2 divided by the total number of distributions, which is 60/729.

Thus, the ratio of their probabilities is:

P(case 1) / P(case 2) = (90/729) / (60/729) = 3/2

This means that case 1 is more likely than case 2 by a factor of 3/2. Therefore, over many rounds of the game, we will see more results of case 1.
