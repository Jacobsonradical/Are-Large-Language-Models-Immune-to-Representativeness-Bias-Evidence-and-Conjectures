To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case. We have:

Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
