To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is given by the combination formula:

C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!]

In this case, n = 6 (the total number of balls) and r = 2 (the number of balls each child gets). Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:

C(6, 2) = 6! / [(6-2)! * 2!] = 720 / [4! * 2] = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball is:

C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) \* C(1, 1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60

Therefore, there are many more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 than in Case 1. To be precise, there are 60 / 15 = 4 times as many ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 as in Case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
