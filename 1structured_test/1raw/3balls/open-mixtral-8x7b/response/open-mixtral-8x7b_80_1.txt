To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 2, and C gets 2 is given by the combination formula:

C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!]

In this case, n = 6 (the total number of balls), and r = 2 (the number of balls given to each child). Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!] = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is:

C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) \* (4! / [3!(4-3)!]) = 15 \* 4 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2, which is more than the 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

So, the answer is:

{case: 2}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
