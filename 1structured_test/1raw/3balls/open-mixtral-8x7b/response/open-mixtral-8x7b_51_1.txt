To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n = 6 (total number of balls), n1 = n2 = n3 = 2 (number of balls for children A, B, and C, respectively).

number of ways for case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can calculate the number of ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from the 6 balls:

number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (15 * 4 * 1) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for both cases:

number of ways for case 1 = 90
number of ways for case 2 = 60

So, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
