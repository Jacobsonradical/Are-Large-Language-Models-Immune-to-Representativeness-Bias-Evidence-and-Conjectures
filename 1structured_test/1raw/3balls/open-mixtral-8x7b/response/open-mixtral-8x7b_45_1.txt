To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can choose 2 balls to give to A in 15 ways (using combinations), then the remaining 4 balls are distributed as B:2, C:2. Therefore, there are 15 ways to achieve case 1.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. We can choose 2 balls to give to A in 15 ways, then choose 3 balls to give to B in 20 ways (since there are 6 - 2 = 4 remaining balls). Therefore, there are 15 \* 20 = 300 ways to achieve case 2.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
