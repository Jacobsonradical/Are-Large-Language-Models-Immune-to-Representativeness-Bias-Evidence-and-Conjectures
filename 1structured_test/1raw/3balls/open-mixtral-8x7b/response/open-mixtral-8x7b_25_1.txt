To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to see which case is more likely.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls to give to each of A, B, and C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, there are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls to give to A, 3 balls to give to B, and 1 ball to give to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 120

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in Case 2 than in Case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
