To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n

(n choose n1, n2, ..., nm) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child, and n! = n*(n-1)*...*1 is the factorial function.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and only 60 ways to distribute them in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
