To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls are given to A, which is given by the combination formula: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls are given to A and which 1 ball is given to C. This can be calculated as follows: C(6, 2) * C(4, 1) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in Case 2 (60 ways) than in Case 1 (15 ways).

Answer: {case: 2}
