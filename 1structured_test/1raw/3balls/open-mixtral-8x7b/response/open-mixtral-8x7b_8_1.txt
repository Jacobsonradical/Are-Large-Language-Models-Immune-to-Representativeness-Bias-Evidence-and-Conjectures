To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children, with 2 balls going to A, 3 balls going to B, and 1 ball going to C. The number of ways to do this is also given by a multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!)) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case. We have:

Number of ways for Case 1 = 90
Number of ways for Case 2 = 60

Since the number of ways for Case 1 is greater than the number of ways for Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, our answer is:

{case: 1}
