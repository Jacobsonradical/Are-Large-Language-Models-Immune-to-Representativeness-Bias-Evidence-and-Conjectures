To solve this problem, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. The multinomial coefficient is given by:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category, and ! denotes factorial.

In our case, n = 6, and we want to find the number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets at least one ball. Therefore, n1, n2, and n3 must be at least 1. This means that we have:

n - 3 = 3

subtracting the minimum number of balls that each child can get from the total number of balls.

So, for case 1, we have:

n1 = 2, n2 = 2, n3 = 2

and the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have:

n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1

and the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 than in case 2.
