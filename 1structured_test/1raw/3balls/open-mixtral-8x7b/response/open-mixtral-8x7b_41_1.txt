To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

In case 1, we have A:2, B:2, C:2. The number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

Here, n = 6 (total balls) and k = 2 (balls per child). So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)
= 6! / (2! * 4!)
= (6*5) / (2*1)
= 15

In case 2, we have A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2, 3, and 1 ball(s) respectively is:

Number of ways = (Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A) * (Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 for B) * (Number of ways to choose 1 ball out of 6 for C)
= C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1)
= (15) * (20) * (6)
= 1800

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 and case 2, we find that there are many more ways for case 2 to occur than case 1:

Case 1: 15
Case 2: 1800

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
