To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

In case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls (6), and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls received by children A, B, and C, respectively (2, 2, and 2). Plugging in these values, we get:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

So there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

In case 2, where children A and B receive 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and child C receives 1 ball, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 than in case 2:

Number of ways for case 1 = 90
Number of ways for case 2 = 60

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
