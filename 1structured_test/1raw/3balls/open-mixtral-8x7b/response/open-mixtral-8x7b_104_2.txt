To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for each child. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of balls, k is the number of balls to distribute to each child, and "!" denotes factorial.

So for Case 1, we have:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)
= 720 / (2 * 24)
= 15

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case as follows:

There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) \* C(1, 1)
= (720 / (2 * 24)) \* (24 / (3 * 2)) \* 1
= 15 \* 4 \* 1
= 60

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 (60 ways) than in Case 1 (15 ways).

So the answer is:
{case: 2}
