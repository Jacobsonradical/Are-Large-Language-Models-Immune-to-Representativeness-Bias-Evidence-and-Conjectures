To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to distribute n balls into k boxes with r1 balls in box 1, r2 balls in box 2, ..., and rk balls in box k is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

In this case, we have n = 6, k = 3, and the possible values of r1, r2, and r3 are (2, 2, 2) and (2, 3, 1). We want to compare the number of ways these distributions can occur.

First, let's calculate the multinomial coefficient for case 1:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Next, let's calculate the multinomial coefficient for case 2:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, our answer is:
{case: 1}
