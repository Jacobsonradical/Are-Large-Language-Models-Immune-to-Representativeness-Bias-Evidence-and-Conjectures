To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, which is given by multinomial coefficients. 

The multinomial coefficient for distributing n balls in m categories with quantities q1, q2, ..., qm is given by:

n! / (q1! * q2! * ... * qm!)

For case 1, we have:

q1 = q2 = q3 = 2
n = 6

So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have:

q1 = 2, q2 = 3, q3 = 1
n = 6

So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 than in case 2. In many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2.
