To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

Case 1: A, B, C each get 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) \* (2 choose 2) / (3 choose 1)^3 = 15

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) / (3 choose 1)^2 = 20

Therefore, there are more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2}
