To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls to be distributed among 3 children, with each child receiving 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items (in this case, balls), n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category (in this case, balls given to each child), and ! denotes factorial.

So for case 1, we have:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, for case 2, we have:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Now let's compare the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 15
Case 2: 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as Case 2 than as Case 1. Specifically, there are 60 ways for the balls to be distributed as Case 2, and only 15 ways for the balls to be distributed as Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
