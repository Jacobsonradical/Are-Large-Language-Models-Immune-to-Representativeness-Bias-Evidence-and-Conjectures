To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children so that each child receives at least one ball is given by the formula:

n - m + 1 choose m-1

In case 1, we have 6 balls and 3 children, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6 - 3 + 1 choose 3 - 1 = 4 choose 2 = 6

In case 2, we also have 6 balls and 3 children, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6 - 3 + 1 choose 3 - 1 = 4 choose 2 = 6

Therefore, both cases are equally likely, and there will be an equal number of results of case 1 and case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1 or 2}
