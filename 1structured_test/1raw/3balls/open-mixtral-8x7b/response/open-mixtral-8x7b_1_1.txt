To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

- There are 6 balls to distribute, and 3 children, so we need to choose 2 balls to give to each child.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n = 6 and k = 2.
- So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

- There are 6 balls to distribute, and 3 children, so we need to choose 2 balls to give to A, 3 balls to give to B, and 1 ball to give to C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.
- The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 is C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20.
- The number of ways to choose 1 ball out of 6 is C(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6.
- So the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is the product of these three numbers: 15 \* 20 \* 6 = 1800.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is much larger than the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1. In many rounds of the game, there will be much more results of case 2 than case 1.
