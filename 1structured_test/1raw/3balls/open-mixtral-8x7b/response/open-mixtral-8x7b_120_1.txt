To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 2) x (2 choose 2) / (3!) = 15

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. We need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 3) x (1 choose 1) / (2!) = 60

Comparing these numbers, we see that there are many more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (60 ways) than in case 1 (15 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
