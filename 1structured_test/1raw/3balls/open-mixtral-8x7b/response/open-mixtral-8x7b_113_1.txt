To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

The total number of balls is 6, and there are 3 children (A, B, C). We can use the stars and bars method to calculate the number of distributions. In this method, we add two bars to separate the balls given to each child, and then count the number of ways to arrange these 6 stars (balls) and 2 bars.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 2 balls to child B, and 2 balls to child C. We can represent this as:
_ * * | * * | * *

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equivalent to choosing 2 positions for the bars among the 8 available positions (6 stars and 2 bars):

Number of ways for case 1 = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8 - 2)!) = 28

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 3 balls to child B, and 1 ball to child C. We can represent this as:
_ * * | * * * | *

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equivalent to choosing 2 positions for the bars among the 8 available positions (6 stars and 2 bars):

Number of ways for case 2 = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! * (8 - 2)!) = 28

Since both cases have the same number of distributions (28), the answer is:

{case: "equal number of distributions for both case 1 and case 2"}
