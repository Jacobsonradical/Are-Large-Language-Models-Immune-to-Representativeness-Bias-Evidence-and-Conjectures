To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of multiset coefficients (also known as "stars and bars" problem). The problem can be thought of as distributing 6 balls (stars) into 3 distinguishable boxes (children), with repetition allowed.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
x_A + x_B + x_C = 6, with the constraint x_A = x_B = 2.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
x_A + x_B + x_C = 6, with the constraint x_A = 2, x_C = 1.

Now let's calculate the number of ways for each case.

Case 1: Since x_A = x_B = 2, the equation becomes 2 + 2 + x_C = 6, which simplifies to x_C = 2. In this case, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.

Case 2: We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
2 + 3 + x_C = 6, which simplifies to x_C = 1. Using multiset coefficients, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6 choose 2 = 15.

Since there are more ways for case 2 (15) than for case 1 (1), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
