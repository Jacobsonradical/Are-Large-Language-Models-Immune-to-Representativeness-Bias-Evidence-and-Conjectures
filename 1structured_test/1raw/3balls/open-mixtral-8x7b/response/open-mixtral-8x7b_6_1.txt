To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to distribute n balls into k boxes with some specific distribution is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of balls in the boxes.

We want to compare the number of ways to distribute the balls with distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 (case 1) and A:2, B:3, C:1 (case 2). Let's calculate the multinomial coefficients for both cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two multinomial coefficients, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls with distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 (case 1) than with distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 (case 2).

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
