To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, and each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, there are 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, and we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls according to Case 1 (90 ways) than there are for Case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, our answer is:
{case: 1}
