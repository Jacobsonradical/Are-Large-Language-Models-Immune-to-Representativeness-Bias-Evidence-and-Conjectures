To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

The total number of balls is 6, and there are 3 children (A, B, C). We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls, and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls distributed to children A, B, and C, respectively.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways to distribute: 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways to distribute: 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case. Case 1 has 90 ways, while Case 2 has 60 ways. Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
