This is a problem of multinomial coefficients and combinations. To find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in case 1 and case 2, we use the formula for multinomial coefficients:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items (in this case, balls), n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category (the number of balls given to each child), and ! denotes factorial.

For case 1, we have:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we compare the number of ways each case can occur. In this case, there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than there are for case 2 to occur (60). Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
