To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls for child C. This can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) \* (2 choose 2) = 15 \* 6 \* 1 = 90

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. This means that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. This can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways).
