To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to see which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n

(n choose n1, n2, ..., nm) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child, and n! denotes n factorial (n times the product of all positive integers up to n).

For case 1, we have:

n1 = n2 = 2, n3 = 2

So the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have:

n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1

So the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, case 1 is more likely than case 2, as it has more possible distributions.
