To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. In this game, we are distributing 6 balls among 3 children, and the number of ways to do this can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

n! / (n1! \* n2! \* n3!)

where n is the total number of balls (6 in this case), and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls given to children A, B, and C, respectively.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to get case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):

6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to get case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):

6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways to get case 1 and case 2:

Number of ways for case 1: 90
Number of ways for case 2: 60

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
