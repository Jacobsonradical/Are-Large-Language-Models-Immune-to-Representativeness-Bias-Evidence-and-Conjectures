To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children so that each child gets ni balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (ni! * (n-(ni+...+nm))!)

where i ranges from 1 to m.

For case 1, we have:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
