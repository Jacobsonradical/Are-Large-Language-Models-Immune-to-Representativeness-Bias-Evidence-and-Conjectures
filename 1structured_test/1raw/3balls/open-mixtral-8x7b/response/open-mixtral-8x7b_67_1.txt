To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) \* (2 choose 2) / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 15

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) / (2! \* 3!) = 10

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (15 ways) than in case 2 (10 ways).
