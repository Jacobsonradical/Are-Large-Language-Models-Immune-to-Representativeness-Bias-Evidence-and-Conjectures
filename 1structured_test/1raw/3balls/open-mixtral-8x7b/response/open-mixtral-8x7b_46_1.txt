To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each get 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C. This can be calculated using combinations:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
= (6! / (2! * (6-2)!)) * (4! / (2! * (4-2)!)) * (2! / (2! * (2-2)!))
= (15) * (6) * (1)
= 90

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C. Again, this can be calculated using combinations:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= (6! / (2! * (6-2)!)) * (4! / (3! * (4-3)!)) * (1! / (1! * (1-1)!))
= (15) * (4) * (1)
= 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case:

Number of ways for case 1 = 90
Number of ways for case 2 = 60

Since the number of ways for case 1 is greater than the number of ways for case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
