To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls that we need to distribute among 3 children. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). To be precise, there are 90 ways to achieve Case 1 and 60 ways to achieve Case 2.

Hence, the answer is:

{case: 1}
