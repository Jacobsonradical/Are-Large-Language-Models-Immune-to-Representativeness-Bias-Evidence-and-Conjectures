To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children so that each child gets ni balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

multinomial(n; ni,nj,...nk) = n! / (ni! * nj! * ... * nk!)

where n = ni + nj + ... + nk, and ! denotes the factorial function.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

multinomial(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
= (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(2*1)*(2*1))
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

multinomial(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
= (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(3*2*1)*(1*1))
= 60

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), by a factor of 3/2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1, probability: higher}
