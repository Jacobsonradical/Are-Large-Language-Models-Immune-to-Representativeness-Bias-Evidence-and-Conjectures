To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for each of A, B, and C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of balls, k is the number of balls to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) * (2! / (2!(2-2)!))
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) * (1! / (1!(1-1)!))
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that Case 1 is more likely, since it has 90 ways, whereas Case 2 has only 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1, reason: more number of ways}
