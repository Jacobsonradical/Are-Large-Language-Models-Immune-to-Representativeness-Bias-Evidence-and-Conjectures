To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for each child. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]

where n is the total number of balls and k is the number of balls given to each child.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6!/[2!(6-2)!]) * (4!/[2!(4-2)!]) * (2!/[2!(2-2)!]) = (15) * (6) * (1) = 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6!/[2!(6-2)!]) * (4!/[3!(4-3)!]) * (1!/[1!(1-1)!]) = (15) * (4) * (1) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that Case 1 has more possible distributions than Case 2:

Number of ways in Case 1: 90
Number of ways in Case 2: 60

Therefore, over many rounds of the game, it is more likely that the balls will be distributed in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
