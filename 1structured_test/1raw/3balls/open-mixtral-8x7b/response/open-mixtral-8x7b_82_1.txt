To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n
---------------------
m! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2. The multinomial coefficient is:

3! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 3

So there are 3 ways to distribute the balls in case 1:

1. A gets balls 1 and 2, B gets balls 3 and 4, C gets balls 5 and 6.
2. A gets balls 3 and 4, B gets balls 1 and 2, C gets balls 5 and 6.
3. A gets balls 5 and 6, B gets balls 1 and 2, C gets balls 3 and 4.

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1. The multinomial coefficient is:

3! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 1

So there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in case 2:

1. A gets balls 1 and 2, B gets balls 3, 4, 5, C gets ball 6.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 than in case 2, it is more likely that a randomly chosen distribution will be in case 1.
