To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n
---------------------
m! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child, and m! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!) is the number of ways to arrange those balls.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

3! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 3

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

3! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 1

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (3 ways) than in case 2 (1 way).
