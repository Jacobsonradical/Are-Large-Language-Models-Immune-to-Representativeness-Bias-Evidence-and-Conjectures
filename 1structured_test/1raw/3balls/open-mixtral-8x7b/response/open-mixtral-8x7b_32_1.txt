To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child. This is equivalent to finding the number of combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time, which is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of balls and k is the number of balls to be chosen.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) x C(4, 2) x C(2, 2) = (6!/(2! * 4!)) x (4!/(2! * 2!)) x (2!/(2! * 0!)) = (15) x (6) x (1) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and 1 ball out of the remaining 1 for C.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

C(6, 2) x C(4, 3) x C(1, 1) = (6!/(2! * 4!)) x (4!/(3! * 1!)) x (1!/(1! * 0!)) = (15) x (4) x (1) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1, it is more likely to occur than case 2.
