To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls to distribute, and each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 6 balls to distribute, and the number of ways to do this is given by:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) with a ratio of 90:60 or 3:2.

Answer: {case: 1, probability: greater}
