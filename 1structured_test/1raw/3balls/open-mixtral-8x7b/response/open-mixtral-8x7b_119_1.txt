To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in both cases and compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have:
- A can choose 2 balls from the 6 in C(6, 2) ways.
- After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and B can choose 2 balls from these in C(4, 2) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls will be given to C.

So, the number of ways for case 1 is: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:
- A can choose 2 balls from the 6 in C(6, 2) ways.
- After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and B can choose 3 balls from these in C(4, 3) ways.
- The remaining ball will be given to C.

So, the number of ways for case 2 is: C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, there are more results of case 1 (90) than case 2 (60). So, the answer is:

{case: 1}
