To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls and 3 children, and each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

(Here, ! denotes factorial, i.e., n! = n \* (n-1) \* (n-2) \* ... \* 1)

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls according to Case 1 (90 ways) than according to Case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
