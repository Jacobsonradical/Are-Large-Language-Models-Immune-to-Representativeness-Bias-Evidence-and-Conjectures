To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n objects into k groups is given by the formula:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n1, n2, ..., nk are the sizes of the k groups.

In case 1, we have 6 balls distributed as 2, 2, 2 among children A, B, and C, respectively. The number of ways to do this is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, we have 6 balls distributed as 2, 3, 1 among children A, B, and C, respectively. The number of ways to do this is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1 and only 60 ways to do so in case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
