To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 available balls, multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, and multiplied by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child C from the remaining 2 balls. This can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 2) x (2 choose 2) = 15 x 6 x 1 = 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 available balls, multiplied by the number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, and multiplied by the number of ways to choose 1 ball for child C from the remaining 1 ball. This can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 3) x (1 choose 1) = 15 x 4 x 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, we can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than there are in case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
