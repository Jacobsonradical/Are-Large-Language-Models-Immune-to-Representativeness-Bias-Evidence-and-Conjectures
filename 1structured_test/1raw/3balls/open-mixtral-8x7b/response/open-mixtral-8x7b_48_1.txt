To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 2) x (2 choose 2) / 3!
= (15) x (6) x (1) / (6)
= 15

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2) x (4 choose 3) x (1 choose 1) / 3!
= (15) x (4) x (1) / (6)
= 10

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
