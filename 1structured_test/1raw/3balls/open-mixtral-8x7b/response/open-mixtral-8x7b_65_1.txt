To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls and 3 children, so we need to divide the balls into 3 groups with 2 balls in each group. This is a Stars and Bars problem, and the number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, n-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

In this case, n=6 and r=3, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6+3-1, 6-1) = C(8, 5) = 56.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, we can use the Stars and Bars formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. This time, we need to divide the balls into 3 groups with 2, 3, and 1 balls in each group, respectively.

The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, n-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children. In this case, n=6 and r=3, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6+3-1, 6-1) = C(8, 5) = 56.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is equal to the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2. Hence, in many rounds of the game, there will be an equal number of results for Case 1 and Case 2.
