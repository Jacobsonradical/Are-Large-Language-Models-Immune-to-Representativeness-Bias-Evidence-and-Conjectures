To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A, which is given by the combination formula C(6,2) = 6! / (2! \* 4!) = 15.

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A and which 1 ball goes to C, which is given by the combination formula C(6,2) \* C(4,1) = 15 \* 4 = 60.

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 (60) than in Case 1 (15), so the answer is:

{case: 2}
