To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
There are 6 balls to distribute, and we need to choose 2 balls for each of A, B, and C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

To compare the number of ways that each case can occur, we can simply compare the two numbers we just calculated:

Number of ways for case 1 = 90
Number of ways for case 2 = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
