To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls to be distributed among 3 children, with each child receiving 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category, and ! denotes factorial.

For case 1, we have n = 6, n1 = n2 = n3 = 2. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
