To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

For case 1, the multinomial coefficient is given by:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, the multinomial coefficient is given by:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Now, we need to compare the number of ways for each case to determine which one is more likely.

Since 90 (case 1) > 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
