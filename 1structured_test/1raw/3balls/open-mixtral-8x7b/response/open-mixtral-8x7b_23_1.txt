To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, times the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B. This gives us:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 2) = 15 \* 6 = 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, times the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B, times the number of ways to choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 to give to C. This gives us:

(6 choose 2) \* (4 choose 3) \* (1 choose 1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
