To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n

(n choose n1, n2, ..., nm) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of balls given to each child, and n! = n*(n-1)*...*1 is the factorial function.

For case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
