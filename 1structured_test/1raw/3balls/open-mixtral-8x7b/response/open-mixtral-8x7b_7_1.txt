To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

There are 6 balls to distribute, and 2 balls will go to A, 2 balls will go to B, and 2 balls will go to C. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) / (2! * 3!) = 10

Comparing the two results, we find that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (15 ways) than in case 2 (10 ways). Therefore, we expect to see more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
