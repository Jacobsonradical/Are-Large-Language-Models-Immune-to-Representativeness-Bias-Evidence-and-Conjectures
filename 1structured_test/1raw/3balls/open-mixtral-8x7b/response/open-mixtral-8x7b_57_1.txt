To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 2, and C gets 2 is equivalent to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls A will get, which is C(6, 2) = 15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is equivalent to the number of ways to choose which 2 balls A will get and which 1 ball C will get, which is C(6, 2) * C(4, 1) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as Case 2 than as Case 1, because Case 2 has 60 ways while Case 1 has only 15 ways. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
