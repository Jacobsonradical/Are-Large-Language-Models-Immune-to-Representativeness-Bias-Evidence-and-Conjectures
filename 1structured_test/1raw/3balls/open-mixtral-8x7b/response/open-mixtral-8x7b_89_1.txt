To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, we have the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

Number of ways for case 1 = (number of ways to choose 2 balls for A) × (number of ways to choose 2 balls for B) × (number of ways to choose 2 balls for C)
= (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2)
= 15 × 6 × 1
= 90

In case 2, we have the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

Number of ways for case 2 = (number of ways to choose 2 balls for A) × (number of ways to choose 3 balls for B) × (number of ways to choose 1 ball for C)
= (6 choose 2) × (6 choose 3) × (6 choose 1)
= 15 × 20 × 6
= 1800

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 and case 2, we see that there are many more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
