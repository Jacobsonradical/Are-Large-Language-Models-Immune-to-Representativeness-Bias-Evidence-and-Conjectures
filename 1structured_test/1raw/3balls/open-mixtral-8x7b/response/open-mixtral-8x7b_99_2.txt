To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multinomial coefficients. In this game, we are distributing 6 balls among 3 children, and the number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls (6 in this case), and n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls given to children A, B, and C, respectively.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, the number of ways to get case 1 is higher than the number of ways to get case 2. Specifically, there are 90 ways to get case 1 and 60 ways to get case 2.

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
