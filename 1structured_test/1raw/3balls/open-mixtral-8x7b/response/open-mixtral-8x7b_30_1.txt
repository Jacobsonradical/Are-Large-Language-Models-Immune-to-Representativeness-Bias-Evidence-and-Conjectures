To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items (in this case, balls), and n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of items in each category (in this case, the number of balls received by each child).

So in case 1, we have:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This means that child A and child C each receive 1 distinct ball, and child B receives the remaining 3 balls (which may or may not be distinct). The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated as follows:

First, we choose 2 balls to give to child A and child C. There are 6 choose 2 ways to do this:

6! / (2! * 4!) = 15

For each choice of 2 balls, there are 4 remaining balls to give to child B. There are 4 choose 3 ways to distribute these 4 balls to child B:

4! / (3! * 1!) = 4

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

15 * 4 = 60

Comparing the two results, we find that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (60) than in case 1 (90).

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
