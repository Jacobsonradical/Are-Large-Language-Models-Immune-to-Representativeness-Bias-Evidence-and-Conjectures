To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, there are 2 balls for each of A, B, and C, and there are a total of 6 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to each child, which is calculated as follows:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! \* (6-2)!)
= (6 \* 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1) / ((2 \* 1) \* (4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1))
= 15

So there are 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

In case 2, there are 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C, for a total of 6 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is calculated as follows:

C(6, 2) \* C(4, 3) = (6! / (2! \* 4!)) \* (4! / (3! \* 1!))
= (6 \* 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1) / ((2 \* 1) \* (4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1)) \* (4 \* 3 \* 2 / (3 \* 2 \* 1))
= 60

So there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 2 (60 ways) than in case 1 (15 ways). Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
