To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls to be distributed among 3 children, with each child receiving 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, there are 6 balls to be distributed among 3 children, but this time the number of balls received by each child is different. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we have:

Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
