To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This means that each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls for child A, times the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls for child B, times the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls for child C. This is:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = (15) × (6) × (1) = 90

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This means that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls for child A, times the number of combinations of choosing 3 balls for child B, times the number of combinations of choosing 1 ball for child C. This is:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = (15) × (4) × (1) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
