To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to do this:

n! / (n1! \* n2! \* ... \* nk!)

where n = 6, n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, and ! denotes factorial.

Number of ways for case 1 = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. We can again use the multinomial coefficient formula:

Number of ways for case 2 = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60 / (2 \* 6) = 5

Now, let's compare the number of ways for each case:

{case: 1}

There will be more results of case 1 (15 ways) than case 2 (5 ways) in many rounds of the game, as the number of ways for case 1 is greater than the number of ways for case 2.
