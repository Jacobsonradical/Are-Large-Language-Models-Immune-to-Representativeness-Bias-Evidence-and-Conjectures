To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case. This is a problem of multinomial coefficients.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find the number of ways to divide 6 balls into 3 groups of 2. This can be calculated as the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find the number of ways to divide 6 balls into 3 groups of 2, 3, and 1. This can be calculated as the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Now, let's compare these two results. We have 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2. This means there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
