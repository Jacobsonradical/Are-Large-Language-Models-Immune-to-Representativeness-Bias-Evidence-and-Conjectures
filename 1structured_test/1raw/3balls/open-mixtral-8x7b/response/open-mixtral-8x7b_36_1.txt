To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to see which case is more likely.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

To distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls, we can use combinations. First, we need to choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.

Once we have given 2 balls to child A, we need to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.

Finally, we give the remaining 2 balls to child C.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 (ways to choose 2 balls for A) \* 6 (ways to choose 2 balls for B) = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

To distribute the balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball, we can proceed as follows:

First, we choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) = 15.

Next, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. The number of ways to do this is C(4,3) = 4.

Finally, we give the remaining 1 ball to child C.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 (ways to choose 2 balls for A) \* 4 (ways to choose 3 balls for B) = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
