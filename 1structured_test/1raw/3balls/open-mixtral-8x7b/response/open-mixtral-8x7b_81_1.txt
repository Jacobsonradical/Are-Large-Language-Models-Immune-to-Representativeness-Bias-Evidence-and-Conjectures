To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

In case 1, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6 balls and 3 children, and each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n(case 1) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to do this is:

n(case 2) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Now, we need to compare the two results. We have:

n(case 1) = 90
n(case 2) = 60

It is clear that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2, since 90 is greater than 60. Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
