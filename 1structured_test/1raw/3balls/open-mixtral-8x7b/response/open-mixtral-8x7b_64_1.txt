To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n distinguishable objects among m distinct groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the numbers of objects in each group, and n = n1 + n2 + ... + nm.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 / (2 * 6) = 5

Therefore, case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2, with 15 possible distributions compared to 5 possible distributions.
