To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare the two results.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups with 2 balls in each group:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

So there are 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. We can use the same formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups with 2 balls in the first group, 3 balls in the second group, and 1 ball in the third group:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 / (2 * 6) = 5

So there are 5 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Comparing the two results, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (15 ways) than in case 2 (5 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
