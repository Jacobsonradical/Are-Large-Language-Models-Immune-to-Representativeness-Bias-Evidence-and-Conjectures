To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

The number of ways to distribute n balls among m children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n1 + n2 + ... + nm = n

(n choose n1, n2, ..., nm) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nm!)

where n1, n2, ..., nm are the number of balls given to each child, and n = n1 + n2 + ... + nm.

In case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, our answer is:

{case: 1}
