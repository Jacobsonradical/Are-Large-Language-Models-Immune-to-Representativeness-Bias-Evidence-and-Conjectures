To solve this problem, let's use the concept of multisets and their number of elements. A multiset is a set with possible repeating elements. In this case, the multisets are the sets of balls assigned to each child.

In case 1, the multiset is {2, 2, 2} (three "2's", one for each child). In case 2, the multiset is {2, 3, 1} (one "2", one "3", and one "1").

To find the number of distributions that result in each case, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls so that the multisets are equal to {2, 2, 2} and {2, 3, 1}.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!) = 90

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
