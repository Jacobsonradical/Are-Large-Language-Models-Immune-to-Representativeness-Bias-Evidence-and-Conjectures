To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case, and then compare these numbers.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls that we want to distribute among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! \* 2! \* 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, there are 6 balls to distribute among 3 children, with 2, 3, and 1 balls for A, B, and C, respectively. The number of ways to do this is:

(6! / (2! \* 3! \* 1!)) = 60

Now, let's compare the two numbers. Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
