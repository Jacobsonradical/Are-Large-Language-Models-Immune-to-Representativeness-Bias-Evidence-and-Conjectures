To solve this question, we need to calculate the number of ways the 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed for each case such that condition of the case is met. The number comparing the two cases will indicate which distribution is more probable in many rounds of the game.

**Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, C gets 2 balls.**

The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
After giving 2 balls to A, \(4\) balls remain. The number of ways to choose which 2 of these balls go to B is \(\binom{4}{2}\), and the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
So, the total number of ways for this case can be computed as:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, C gets 1 ball.**

The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
After giving 2 balls to A, \(4\) balls remain. The number of ways to choose which 3 of these go to B is \(\binom{4}{3}\), and the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
So, the total number of ways for this case can be computed as:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing these two results:
- Case 1 (90 ways) has more ways than Case 2 (60 ways).

So in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of **Case 1** where each child receives 2 balls each. Hence:

{case: 1}
