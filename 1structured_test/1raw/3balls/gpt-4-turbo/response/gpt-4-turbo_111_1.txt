To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will be more prevalent, we need to calculate the number of ways each of these distributions can occur in a round.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We have 6 distinguishable balls, and each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can calculate the number of ways this distribution can occur using combinations. First, we choose 2 balls from 6 for child A, then choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B, and finally, the remaining 2 balls go to child C.

The number of ways to do this is:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 2 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- No choice needed for C, as there are only 2 balls left: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

Thus,
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Again, we have 6 distinguishable balls, but distributed differently. We choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B among the remaining 4, and the last ball goes to child C.

The number of ways to do this is:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 3 balls for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- Choose 1 ball for C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) (but this step is trivial as only one ball is left)

Thus,
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparing the two cases:**
- Case 1 yields 90 possible outcomes.
- Case 2 yields 60 possible outcomes.

Since Case 1 has a higher number of possible outcomes:

{case: 1}
