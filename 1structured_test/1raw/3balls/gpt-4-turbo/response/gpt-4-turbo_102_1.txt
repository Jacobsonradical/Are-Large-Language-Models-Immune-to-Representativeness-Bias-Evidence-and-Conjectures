To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we first have to look at the number of different ways each case can occur. 

Let us consider each case:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- First, choose 2 balls for child A. There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to do this.
- Then, choose 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls. There are \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways to do this.
- Finally, the last 2 balls will go to child C. There is \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) way to give the remaining 2 balls to C.
Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Choose 2 balls for child A. There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to do this.
- Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. There are \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways to do this.
- The remaining ball will go to child C. There is \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \) way to do this.
Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Since \(90 > 60\), there will more results of Case 1 compared to Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
