To determine the likelihood of each case, we first need to calculate how many ways each distribution can occur given the conditions of the cases.

For case 1 where each child receives 2 balls:
We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and the remaining 2 balls to C. Using combinatorial choice (each choice considering all preceding choices):

1. Choose 2 balls from the 6 balls for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The last 2 balls will go to child C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

For case 2 where children A, B, and C receive 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively:
1. Choose 2 balls from the 6 balls for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The last ball will go to child C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases, case 1 (90 ways) occurs more frequently than case 2 (60 ways) due to the more symmetric distribution of the balls leading to a higher number of combinations in case 1.

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
