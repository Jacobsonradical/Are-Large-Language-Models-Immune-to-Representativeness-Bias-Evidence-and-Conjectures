To determine whether case 1 or case 2 occurs more often, we need to compute the number of outcomes corresponding to each distribution of the balls.

Recall there are 6 distinguishable balls, and these are being distributed among the three children, A, B, and C.

**Case 1**: A receives 2 balls, B receives 2 balls, C also receives 2 balls.
We calculate the number of ways to achieve this distribution using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

This represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B from the remaining 4, and finally the 2 last balls automatically go to C.

**Case 2**: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
Similarly, we use the multinomial coefficient for this distribution:

\[ \binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

This represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, and finally the last ball goes to C.

Comparing these two quantities, we see:

- Case 1 has 90 different outcomes.
- Case 2 has 60 different outcomes.

Therefore, it is evident that case 1 will result in more unique outcomes than case 2.

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
