To find out whether there are more outcomes of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of different ways each distribution can happen.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
Here, each child receives exactly 2 balls. To find the total number of ways, we choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and finally, the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1
\]
So the total number of ways is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Here, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. Similar to the calculation for Case 1, we use the combination formula:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \; (\text{as calculated above})
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]
So the total number of ways is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- Case 1 has 90 outcomes
- Case 2 has 60 outcomes

Thus, there are more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
