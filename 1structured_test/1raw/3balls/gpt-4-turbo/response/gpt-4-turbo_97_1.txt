To determine the likelihood of each case, we can compute the number of ways each distribution case can happen.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

This case requires dividing the 6 balls into three groups where each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can calculate the number of ways to do this by picking which 2 balls go to A, then which 2 of the remaining 4 balls go to B, and the rest go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula: \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, we pick 2 balls from the remaining 4 for B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. The last 2 balls will automatically go to C, and there's just 1 way to "choose" these 2 balls (\(\binom{2}{2}\)).

Thus, the total number of ways for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}.
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Calculating in a similar way, but now child B gets 3 balls and child C gets 1. First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A (\(\binom{6}{2}\)), then choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B (\(\binom{4}{3}\)), and finally the last ball will go to C (\(\binom{1}{1}\)).

Thus, the total number of ways for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}.
\]

Comparing the results, case 1 has 90 ways while case 2 has 60 ways. Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
