To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be expressed by a multinomial coefficient. In general, if n items are divided into groups of sizes n1, n2, ..., nk, the number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{n}{n1, n2, ..., nk} = \frac{n!}{n1! \times n2! \times ... \times nk!}
\]

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
Number of ways to achieve this distribution:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Number of ways to achieve this distribution:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Now comparing the numbers:

- Case 1 results in 90 ways.
- Case 2 results in 60 ways.

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), we expect more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game because there are more combinations that fit the distribution of Case 1.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
