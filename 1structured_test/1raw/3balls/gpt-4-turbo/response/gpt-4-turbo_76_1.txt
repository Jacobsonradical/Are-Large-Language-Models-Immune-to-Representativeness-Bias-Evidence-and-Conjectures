To answer this question, we need to calculate how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each of the specified cases, and then compare these numbers.

Each ball can be given to any one of the three children independently. Hence, each distribution of the balls can be thought of as a sequence of decisions, where each decision is choosing one of the three children for each ball. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is \(3^6\), since each of the 6 balls has 3 choices of where to go.

Let's calculate the number of distributions for each case:

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**: Here, each child receives exactly 2 balls. We calculate the number of distributions by choosing 2 balls out of the 6 for child A, then choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C. 
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is given by the combination: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 is: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- The last two balls automatically go to C, with only 1 way: \(\binom{2}{2}\).
- So, the total ways for Case 1 = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**: Here, child A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- The last ball (1 ball) automatically goes to C, with only 1 way: \(\binom{1}{1}\).
- So, the total ways for Case 2 = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing the numbers from both cases, we see that Case 1 has more possible distributions (90) than Case 2 (60).

Thus, we conclude:
{case: 1}
