To determine which case occurs more frequently, we should compute the probabilities of each distribution.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Here, we need to distribute 2 balls among 6 balls to child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls to child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. The number of ways to do this is determined by combinations (where the order of selection does not matter):

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. Choose 2 balls for C out of the remaining 2: \(\binom{2}{2}\).

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15,
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6,
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1.
\]
The total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, we choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. Choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1: \(\binom{1}{1}\).

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \text{ (as before)},
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4}{1} = 4,
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1.
\]
The total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), it is more frequent to have the first case than the second case.

**In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of:**

{case: 1}
