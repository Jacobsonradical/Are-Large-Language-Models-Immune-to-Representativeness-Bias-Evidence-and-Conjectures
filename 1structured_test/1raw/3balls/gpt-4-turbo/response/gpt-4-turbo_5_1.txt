To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, I will first calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2:
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- After choosing 2 balls for child A, 4 balls are left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of those remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- The remaining 2 balls go to child C automatically, which can occur in only 1 way (\(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)).

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this configuration is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

For case 2, where the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1:
- Choose 2 balls for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- The last ball goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this configuration is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Comparing the two cases, we have:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Because 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results following the configuration of case 1.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
