To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each of these distributions can happen.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To distribute 2 balls to each child:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 balls for child C: \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 1 is: 
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

To distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. Choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 ball for child C: \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**

There are more outcomes where the distribution of balls is as in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, there will be more results following the distribution pattern of Case 1.

So, we conclude:
{case: 1}
