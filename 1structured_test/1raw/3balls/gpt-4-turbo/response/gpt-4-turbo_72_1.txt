To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we compute the number of ways each distribution can occur. 

For each case, we count the number of distinct ways to assign the 6 distinguishable balls to the three children A, B, and C according to the specified counts.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- We first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Next, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- Finally, the last 2 balls must go to child C, and there is only 1 way (\(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)) to assign these remaining balls to C.

The total number of ways for case 1 is therefore: 
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Firstly, select 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls. The number of ways to do this is: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Next, select 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. The number of ways to do this is: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- The last remaining ball goes to child C, and there is 1 way (\(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)) to do this.

The total number of ways for case 2 is therefore: 
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Number of ways for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) = 90
- Number of ways for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2. The answer is:

{case: 1}
