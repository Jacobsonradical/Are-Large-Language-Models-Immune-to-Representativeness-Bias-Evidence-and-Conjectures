To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

**Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2**: 
Here, we need to distribute 2 balls to each child. To calculate the number of ways to do this, we first choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A, then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this can be derived as follows:
  - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
  - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
  - The remaining 2 balls for C is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way (only one way).
  
Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1**: 
In this arrangement, we first choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B, and the last ball goes to C. Calculating these:
  - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
  - The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
  - The last ball to C is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way (only one way).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Based on these calculations:
- **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)** occurs in **90 ways**.
- **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)** occurs in **60 ways**.

Since 90 > 60, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.
