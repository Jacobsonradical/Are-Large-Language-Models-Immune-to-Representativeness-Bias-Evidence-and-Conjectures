To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we calculate the number of ways each case's specific distribution of balls can occur. 

For **case 1** where A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls, the number of ways this can occur is given by the formula:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} \]
Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the number of combinations of \(n\) items taken \(k\) at a time. This calculation determines how many ways we can choose 2 balls for each child in sequence:
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A,
- Then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B,
- Finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to C.

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

For **case 2** where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the number of ways follows similarly:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} \]
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A,
- Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B,
- The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Since 90 (for case 1) is greater than 60 (for case 2), **case 1** will occur more frequently than case 2 in many rounds of the game. Thus:

{case: 1}
