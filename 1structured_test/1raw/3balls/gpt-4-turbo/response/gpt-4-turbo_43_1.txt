To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we should calculate the number of different ways each case can occur. Since each ball is distinguishable, the results depend on the specific allocation of balls to children A, B, and C.

**Case 1: Each child receives 2 balls**

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, we are left with 4 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 out of these 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. Hence, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball**

The number of ways to select 2 balls from 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). With 4 balls remaining, the number of ways to select 3 balls for child B is \(\binom{4}{3}\). Finally, the only remaining ball will go to child C. Thus, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

**Comparison and Conclusion:**

Case 1 (90 ways) occurs more frequently than Case 2 (60 ways), as the distribution of balls is more balanced in Case 1, leading to a higher number of combinations. Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
