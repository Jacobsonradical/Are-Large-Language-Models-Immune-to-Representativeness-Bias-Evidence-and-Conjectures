To solve this problem, we will compute the number of ways each case can occur, i.e., the number of possible distributions of 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, C) according to the specifications of each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We must choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 will automatically go to child C. Using combinations, this can be calculated as:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
- Automatically, the remaining 2 balls go to C: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

The number of ways this can be done is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Similarly, we choose 2 balls for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last remaining ball goes to child C:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
- The last remaining ball goes to C: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

The number of ways this can be done is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparison:**
- Case 1 configurations = 90
- Case 2 configurations = 60

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 than case 2. Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
