To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, let's compute the number of ways each specific distribution can happen.

Each ball has 3 choices of children to go to (A, B, or C). So, there are a total of \(3^6 = 729\) possible outcomes for the distribution of the balls among the children. However, for answering the question, we need to consider the specific distributions: 

1. **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**: 
   We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, then out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 to give to B, then the last 2 automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by:
    \[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
    \]
   - \(\binom{6}{2}\) where 6 is the total number of balls and 2 are given to child A.
   - From the remaining 4 balls, \(\binom{4}{2}\) is choosing 2 balls for child B.
   - Lastly, \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) is the only way of assigning the remaining 2 balls to child C.

    Calculate:
    \[
    \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15, \quad \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
    \]
    \[
    15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
    \]

2. **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
   Again, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, then the last ball goes to C. The number of ways to do this is:
    \[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
    \]
    Calculate:
    \[
    \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
    \]
    \[
    15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
    \]

Now, comparing the two:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Given these counts, case 1, where each child gets exactly 2 balls, has more possible distributions than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
