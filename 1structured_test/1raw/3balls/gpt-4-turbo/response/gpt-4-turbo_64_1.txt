To solve this question, we will calculate the number of possible distributions for each case and compare them.

Given that the balls are distinguishable, and each ball can go to any one of the three children A, B, or C, each distribution for the cases can be computed using the multinomial distribution. The multinomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula

\[
\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot k_m!}
\]

where \(n\) is the total number of items (balls) to distribute, and \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m\) are the numbers of items each of the \(m\) groups (in this case, children) receive.

**Case 1**: A:2, B:2, C:2

We calculate the multinomial coefficient for 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C:

\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2**: A:2, B:3, C:1

We calculate the multinomial coefficient for 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C:

\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing these results, we see that the number of possible distributions is greater for Case 1 (90 ways) than for Case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
