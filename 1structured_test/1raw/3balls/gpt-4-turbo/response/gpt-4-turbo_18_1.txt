To find the more frequent case between case 1 and case 2 when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, we must consider the number of ways each configuration can occur. We look into the combinations rather than permutations because the order within each group does not matter (only the differentiation between groups matters).

**Case 1**: Each child receives 2 balls. 
- We determine the number of ways to choose which 2 balls out of 6 go to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Then, we pick 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- Finally, child C receives the last 2 balls, which happens in only one way: \(\binom{2}{2}\).

Thus,
\[
\text{Ways for Case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2**: Child A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
- We choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Then, we select 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- Finally, C gets the remaining ball, and thereâ€™s only one way for that: \(\binom{1}{1}\).

Thus,
\[
\text{Ways for Case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing both cases, Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 ways it can occur, while Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 ways. Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2 after many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
