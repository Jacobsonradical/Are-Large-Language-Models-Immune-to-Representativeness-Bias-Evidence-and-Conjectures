To determine which of the two cases will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and compare these numbers.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

This distribution requires choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, leaving the last 2 for child C. The number of ways to do this is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Using the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\):

- \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15\)
- \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\)
- \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

For this distribution, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, leaving 1 for child C. The number of ways is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Again, using the combination calculations:

- \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) (as before)
- \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3! \times (4-3)!} = 4\)
- \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparison:**

- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), there will be more results with the distribution in Case 1.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
