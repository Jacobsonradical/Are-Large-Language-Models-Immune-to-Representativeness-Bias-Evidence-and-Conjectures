To solve this, let's calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed according to each case:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Each child gets exactly 2 balls. We must count how the balls can be distributed in such a way:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to child C. There is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to do this.

The number of ways the balls can be distributed in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
3. The last ball automatically goes to child C. There is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to do this.

The number of ways the balls can be distributed in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
