To calculate the probability of each case, we determine how many different ways there are to distribute the balls in the specified manner, and compare them.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to find the number of ways to distribute 2 balls each to A, B, and C. This is a multinomial distribution problem, where we compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls into the groups of 2, 2, and 2.

The multinomial coefficient can be given by: 
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Likewise, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C.

The multinomial coefficient here is:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

### Comparison
Since there are 90 ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) but only 60 ways to achieve case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there will be more rounds resulting in case 1, where the balls are evenly distributed among A, B, and C.
