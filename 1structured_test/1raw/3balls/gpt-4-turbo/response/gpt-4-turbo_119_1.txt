To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and compare them.

**Case 1: A=2, B=2, C=2**

To find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient. The multinomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}\) signifies the number of distinct ways to divide \(n\) objects into groups of sizes \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m\). For this case, we seek \(\binom{6}{2, 2, 2}\).

The formula for the multinomial coefficient is:
\[
\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_m!}
\]
Plugging in our values:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! 2! 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A=2, B=3, C=1**

Now we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. Use the multinomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2, 3, 1}\):
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! 3! 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- **Case 1** has 90 ways.
- **Case 2** has 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more outcomes where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than where the distribution is 2, 3, and 1 (Case 2). This is because there are more combinations or ways to achieve the former distribution.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
