To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to find the number of ways in which each particular distribution of balls can occur, and then compare these numbers.

**Total Number of Ways to Distribute Balls:**
There are a total of 6 distinguishable balls, and each can go to any of the three children (A, B, or C). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is \(3^6 = 729\).

**Case 1: (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
We need to calculate how many ways we can choose 2 of the 6 balls to give to A, then choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls to give to B, and the remaining 2 automatically go to C.

This can be calculated using binomial coefficients:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- The remaining 2 automatically go to C: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

Thus, the total number of ways for case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- The remaining 1 automatically goes to C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

Thus, the total number of ways for case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
The number of ways for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is 90, and for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is 60. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 as it can occur in more ways than case 2.
