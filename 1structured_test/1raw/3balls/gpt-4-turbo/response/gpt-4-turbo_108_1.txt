To find which case is more likely to occur, we can calculate the number of different ways each distribution of balls could happen concerning the principles of combinatorics.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
1. Choose 2 balls for Child A out of 6 balls. The number of ways is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose another 2 balls for Child B from the remaining 4 balls. The number of ways is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The remaining 2 balls will go to Child C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Hence, the number of ways Case 1 can happen is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
1. Choose 2 balls for Child A out of 6. The number of ways is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls for Child B from the remaining 4 balls. The number of ways is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The last remaining ball will go to Child C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

Hence, the number of ways Case 2 can happen is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two:
- **Case 1** has **90** possible ways.
- **Case 2** has **60** possible ways.

Clearly, Case 1 is more likely to occur than Case 2 because there are more possible arrangements of distributing the balls among the children in Case 1 compared to Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
