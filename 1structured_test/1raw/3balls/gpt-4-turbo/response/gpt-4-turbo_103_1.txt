To determine which case will occur more frequently, we'll calculate the number of different ways each case could occur in a given round and compare these numbers.

Each ball is distinguishable, and it can go to any of the children. Therefore, for any individual ball, there are 3 choices of who it can be given to.

Let's look at each case:

**Case 1** - A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, each child receives exactly 2 balls.
- First, choose which 2 of the 6 balls will go to child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 balls out of 6.
- Next, choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Finally, the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C, and there is only \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to allocate these 2 balls.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2** - A:2, B:3, C:1
- Choose 2 balls out of the 6 to go to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Choose 3 of the remaining 4 balls to go to B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. 
- The last ball will automatically go to C, and there is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to allocate this ball.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two, we find that case 1 occurs in 90 ways and case 2 in 60 ways. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1. Answer is:

{case: 1}
