To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways that each case can occur, and compare them.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
This case requires distributing 2 balls to each child. The number of ways to assign 2 balls to child A out of 6 can be calculated using combinations:

\[
\text{Ways to choose 2 balls for A} = \binom{6}{2}
\]

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we have 4 balls left. We then need to choose 2 of these remaining balls for child B:

\[
\text{Ways to choose 2 balls for B from remaining 4} = \binom{4}{2}
\]

Finally, the last 2 balls must go to child C, and there's exactly one way to do this:

\[
\text{Ways to assign remaining 2 balls to C} = \binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

Thus, the total number of ways for case 1 can be calculated by multiplying these combinations:

\[
\text{Total ways for case 1} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Similar to Case 1, we calculate the ways to distribute the balls among the children as follows:

\[
\text{Ways to choose 2 balls for A} = \binom{6}{2}
\]

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we have 4 balls left. We now need to distribute 3 of these to child B:

\[
\text{Ways to choose 3 balls for B from remaining 4} = \binom{4}{3}
\]

And the remaining 1 ball goes to child C:

\[
\text{Ways to assign remaining 1 ball to C} = \binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

Then, the total ways for case 2 are:

\[
\text{Total ways for case 2} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
- Total ways for case 1 = 90
- Total ways for case 2 = 60

Since 90 (total for case 1) is greater than 60 (total for case 2), it implies that there will be more outcomes consistent with **Case 1** than with **Case 2**. Therefore:

```
{case: 1}
```
