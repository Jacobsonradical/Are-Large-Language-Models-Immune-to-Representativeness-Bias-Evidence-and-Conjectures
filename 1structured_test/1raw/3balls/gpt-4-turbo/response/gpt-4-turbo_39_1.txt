To answer this question, we need to compute the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed to the children according to each case.

We will use the multinomial coefficient, which describes the number of ways of distributing \(n\) objects into \(r\) groups where there are \(k_1, k_2, ..., k_r\) objects in each group. The formula for the multinomial coefficient is:
\[
\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, ..., k_r} = \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! ... k_r!}
\]

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2** 
- Here, we are distributing 6 balls such that child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 2 balls, and child C also receives 2 balls. Using the multinomial formula:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1** 
- In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. Applying the multinomial distribution formula:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**

Comparing these results:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has \(90\) combinations,
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has \(60\) combinations.

Therefore, more results will occur in Case 1 where each child receives exactly 2 balls.

Thus, the answer is as follows:
{case: 1}
