To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls according to the distributions given in each case. 

Each ball has 3 choices (children A, B, or C) for whom it can be given. The total number of ways to distribute all balls in any manner is \(3^6\) because each ball has 3 choices independently. This full case is not directly useful but serves as a reference point. Letâ€™s focus on the requested cases.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**  
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B, and the last 2 balls automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is calculated as:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]
So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls such that A, B, and C each get exactly 2 balls.

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**  
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B, and the last 1 ball goes to C. The number of ways to do this is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]
So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1.

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
