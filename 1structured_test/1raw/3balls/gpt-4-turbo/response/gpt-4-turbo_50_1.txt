To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of different ways each distribution can happen given the conditions outlined in each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose 2 balls for each child. First, we choose 2 balls to give to A, then 2 balls to give to B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. The number of ways to do this is the product of selecting 2 out of 6 balls for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and the last 2 automatically assigned to C. Hence, the mathematical representation is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is a binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements. Calculating these numbers:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{1 \times 2} = 15\)
- \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{1 \times 2} = 6\)
- \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

So, the total combinations for Case 1:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

In this case, first, we choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, leaving 1 ball for C. The mathematical representation is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating these numbers:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) (same as before)
- \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{1 \times 2 \times 3} = 4\)
- \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

So, the total combinations for Case 2:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the results, Case 1 has more combinations (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

Based on this calculation, the answer is:
{case: 1}
