To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we first need to calculate the number of possible ways each distribution can occur. The 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed to three children in a variety of configurations characterized by the tuples (x, y, z), where x, y, and z denote the number of balls given to Child A, B, and C respectively, such that x + y + z = 6.

**Calculations:**

**Case 1: (2, 2, 2)**
- Each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to Child A is:
  \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Once the balls for Child A are selected, the number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to Child B (from the remaining 4 balls) is:
  \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Then, the remaining 2 balls must go to Child C, which can be done in exactly:
  \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.
  
  Hence, the total number of ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls is:
  \[
  \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}.
  \]

**Case 2: (2, 3, 1)**
- The number of ways to choose which 2 balls go to Child A is:
  \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- The number of ways to choose which 3 balls go to Child B (from the remaining 4 balls) is:
  \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- The remaining 1 ball must go to Child C, which can be done in exactly:
  \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.
  
  Hence, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in the configuration (2, 3, 1) is:
  \[
  \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}.
  \]

**Comparison:**
- Case 1 occurs in 90 ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 60 ways.

**Conclusion:**
As Case 1 has more possible ways of occurring than Case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
