To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we should calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Each of the six balls can be given to any of the three children independently. Thus, there are \(3^6 = 729\) total ways to distribute the balls among the children.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A, 2 of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the last 2 will automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90.
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
We choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A, 3 of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the last ball will go to child C. The number of ways to choose this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60.
\]

Thus, there are more outcomes for case 1, where each child gets exactly 2 balls, than for case 2, where the distribution is 2, 3, and 1. 

Therefore, the answer to your question is:
{case: 1}
