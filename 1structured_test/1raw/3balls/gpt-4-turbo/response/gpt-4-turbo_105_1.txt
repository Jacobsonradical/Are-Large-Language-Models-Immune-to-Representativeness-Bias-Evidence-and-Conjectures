To determine which case, 1 or 2, will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls according to each scenario.

**Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.**
- We first choose 2 out of 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Next, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Finally, the last 2 balls go to C. There is \(\binom{2}{2}\) way to do this.

So, the total number of outcomes for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.**
- First, choose 2 out of 6 balls for A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Next, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
- Finally, the last 1 ball goes to C. There is \(\binom{1}{1}\) way to do this.

So, the total number of outcomes for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 outcomes.
- Case 2 has 60 outcomes.

Since case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2,

{case: 1}
