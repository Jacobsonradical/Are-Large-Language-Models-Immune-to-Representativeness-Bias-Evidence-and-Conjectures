To determine which case will occur more frequently, we must calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur. Let's consider what each distribution means:

**Case 1:** A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
Here, each child gets exactly 2 balls. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is:
- Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- The last 2 balls go to C and there's only 1 way to choose them: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2:** A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
Here, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. We need to:
- Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- The last ball goes to C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

When comparing, case 1 occurs in 90 ways, and case 2 occurs in 60 ways.

So the question of which case will occur more often can be answered as:
{case: 1}
