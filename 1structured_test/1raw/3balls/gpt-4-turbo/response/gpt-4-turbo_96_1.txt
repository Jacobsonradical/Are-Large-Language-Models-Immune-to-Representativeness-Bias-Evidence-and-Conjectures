To determine which case appears more frequently, we need to calculate the number of distinct ways each distribution can occur and compare them.

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among children A, B, and C according to the given distributions:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- First, we select 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is given by the combination \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Next, from the remaining 4 balls, we select 2 for B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- The last 2 balls automatically go to C.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]
\[
= 15 \times 6 \times 1
\]
\[
= 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- First, choose 2 balls for A from the 6, which as before is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Next, choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- The last ball goes to C.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]
\[
= 15 \times 4 \times 1
\]
\[
= 60
\]

Comparing these results, we observe that the number of ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 (90 ways) exceeds the number in Case 2 (60 ways). Hence, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will appear more frequently than Case 2.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
