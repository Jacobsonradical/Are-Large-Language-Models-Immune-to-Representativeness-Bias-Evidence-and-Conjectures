To determine whether case 1 or case 2 occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of different ways in which each case can happen, considering the distinguishable nature of the balls.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To find out the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls so that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 balls go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \). The number of ways to choose the next 2 balls from the remaining 4 is \( \binom{4}{2} \), and the remaining 2 balls can only be arranged in \( \binom{2}{2} \) = 1 way. Therefore, the total number of distributions for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, Child A gets 2 balls, Child B 3 balls, and Child C 1 ball. First, we select 2 balls for A from the 6, then choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, and then 1 ball for C from the remaining 1.

Following a similar combinatorial calculation:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) happens in 90 ways
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) happens in 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, Case 1 occurs more frequently than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
