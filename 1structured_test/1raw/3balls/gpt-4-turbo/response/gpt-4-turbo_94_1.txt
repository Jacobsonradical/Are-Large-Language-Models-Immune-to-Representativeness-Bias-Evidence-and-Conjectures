To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the probability, or the number of ways, each case can occur relative to the total possible distributions of the balls.

Each ball can be given to any of the three children, which means there are \(3^6 = 729\) possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We need to choose 2 balls to give to child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the final 2 balls automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations (denoted here as "nCr", which represents choosing r elements from a set of n elements without considering order):
- Ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- Ways to assign the last 2 balls to C is \(\binom{2}{2}\) but this is just 1, as there are no other options.

The total number of ways for case 1 is
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Similarly, calculate:
- Ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- Ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 is \(\binom{1}{1}\)

The total number of ways for case 2 is
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Since there are 90 possible outcomes for case 1 and 60 possible outcomes for case 2, there are more potential results where each child gets exactly two balls (case 1) than if A and C each get two and three balls respectively, and B gets one (case 2). Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
