To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen and compare these quantities.

**Case 1**: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2**: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner can be calculated as:

\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions

Since there are more distributions possible in case 1, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
