To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways we can distribute 6 distinguishable balls into two different cases:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
In this scenario, each child receives exactly 2 balls. We start by choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we choose 2 for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. Finally, the remaining 2 balls must go to child C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways. Multiplying these together gives:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
In this case, we start by choosing 2 balls for child A from the 6, which is \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Next, from the remaining 4 balls, we choose 3 for child B, which is \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. Finally, the last remaining ball goes to child C, which is \(\binom{1}{1}\) way. Therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Comparing the results, we see that:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in multiple rounds of the game. Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
