To solve this problem, we calculate the probability of each case by finding the number of ways to distribute the balls according to each case scenario and then comparing these numbers.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
The number of ways to distribute the balls such that A, B, and C each get 2 balls can be computed by first choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, and finally the last 2 balls will automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
In this case, we again use a multinomial coefficient where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The ways to allocate the balls are:
\[ \binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

Comparing the two results:
- **Case 1** has **90** ways.
- **Case 2** has **60** ways.

Since case 1 has more ways to happen compared to case 2, we can conclude that case 1 will occur more frequently if a large number of game rounds are played.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
