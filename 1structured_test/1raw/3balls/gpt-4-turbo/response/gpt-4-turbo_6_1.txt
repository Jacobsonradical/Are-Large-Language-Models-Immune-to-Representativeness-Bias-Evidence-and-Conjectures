To determine whether there will be more outcomes of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate how many ways each distribution can occur. 

**Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2:**
We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that each child receives exactly 2 balls. This can be solved using the multinomial coefficient, which is calculated as follows:
\[ \binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]
There are 90 ways to distribute the balls so that each child gets 2 balls.

**Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1:**
Here, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. We calculate this arrangement similarly:
\[ \binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]
There are 60 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Comparing both results:
- Case 1 has 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 has 60 possible distributions.

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 over many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
