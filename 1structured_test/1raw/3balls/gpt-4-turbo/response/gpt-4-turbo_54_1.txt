To solve this problem, we can compute the likelihood of each case by determining the number of different ways the balls can be distributed according to the constraints given for each case.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
We have 6 distinguishable balls and they need to be distributed among children A, B, and C such that each child receives exactly 2 balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After distributing 2 balls to A, there are 4 balls left.

Next, the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). Child C would automatically get the remaining 2 balls.

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 is given by:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
Again, we start with 6 distinguishable balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). Now 4 balls remain.

Next, out of these 4, we choose 3 for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. Child C would get the remaining single ball.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing these results:
- Case 1 can occur in 90 ways.
- Case 2 can occur in 60 ways.

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Final result:
{case: 1}
