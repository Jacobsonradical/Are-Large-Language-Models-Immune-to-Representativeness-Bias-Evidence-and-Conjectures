To determine which case will occur more frequently across many rounds of the game, we need to compute the probability of each distribution scheme.

To distribute 6 distinguishable balls among A, B, and C:

**Case 1: (A=2, B=2, C=2)**
- Choose 2 balls for A: There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to do this.
- Choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls for B: There are \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways to do this.
- The last 2 balls must go to C: There is \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) way to do this.
  
The total number of ways to distribute the balls as per Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways.}
\]

**Case 2: (A=2, B=3, C=1)**
- Choose 2 balls for A: There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to do this.
- Choose 3 of the remaining 4 balls for B: There are \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways to do this.
- The last ball must go to C: There is \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \) way to do this.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls as per Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways.}
\]

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways to distribute the balls according to Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, over many rounds, we can expect Case 1 to occur more frequently than Case 2.

Given the numbers of ways for each case, the answer is:
{case: 1}
