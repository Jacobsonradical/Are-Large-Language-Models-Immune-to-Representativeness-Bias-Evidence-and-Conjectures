To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each of the two cases, and then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely to occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Each child receives exactly 2 balls. We choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A, then 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this is calculated as follows:

- Ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 = \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 = \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- Ways for C are determined automatically with the remaining 2 balls, so \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\).

The total number of ways is: 
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

- Ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 = \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 = \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- Ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1 = \(\binom{1}{1}\).

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this way is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Thus, comparing the number of ways:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 where each child receives 2 balls.
