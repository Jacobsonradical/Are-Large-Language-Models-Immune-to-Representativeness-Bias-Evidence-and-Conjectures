To determine which case occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of possible ways that the balls can be distributed according to the distributions specified in each case. We will use the formula for the multinomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways of distributing a total of \( n \) distinct objects into groups of given sizes.

The multinomial coefficient is calculated as:
\[
\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r} = \frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\ldots k_r!}
\]
Where \( n \) is the total number of items to distribute (in this case, 6 balls), and \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_r \) are the sizes of each group (in this case, the number of balls each child gets).

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- To find the number of distributions where children A, B, and C each get 2 balls, we calculate:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- To find the number of distributions where children A, B, and C get 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively, we calculate:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparison of the results shows:
- Case 1 results in 90 ways.
- Case 2 results in 60 ways.

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), we have more occurrences of case 1 relative to case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\{ \text{case:} \, 1 \}
\]
