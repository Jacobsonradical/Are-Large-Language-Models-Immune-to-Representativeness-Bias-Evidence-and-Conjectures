To solve this, we need to determine how often each case will occur when the balls are distributed at random among the three children, A, B, and C.

**Case 1:** Distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2.
To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we need to assign 2 out of the 6 balls to A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to B, and the last 2 automatically go to C. Using the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items, the calculation goes as follows:
- Ways to choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- Ways to distribute the remaining 2 balls to C (only 1 way): \(\binom{2}{2}\)

The calculation is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2:** Distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1.
Here, we assign 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B from the remaining 4, and the last ball to C. The calculation is:
- Ways to choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- Ways to distribute the remaining 1 ball to C: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

The calculation is therefore:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur compared to 60 ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game. Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
