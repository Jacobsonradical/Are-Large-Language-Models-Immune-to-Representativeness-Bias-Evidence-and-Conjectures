To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we calculate the number of ways each case can occur, given that all balls are distinguishable.

**Case 1:** A:2, B:2, C:2
- First, choose 2 balls to give to child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- The final 2 balls go to child C, with only \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to do this.

The total number of ways:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2:** A:2, B:3, C:1
- First, choose 2 balls for child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- The last remaining ball goes to child C, only \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

The total number of ways:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the counts of each case:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Consequently, case 1 (where each child receives exactly 2 balls) has more possible outcomes compared to case 2.
