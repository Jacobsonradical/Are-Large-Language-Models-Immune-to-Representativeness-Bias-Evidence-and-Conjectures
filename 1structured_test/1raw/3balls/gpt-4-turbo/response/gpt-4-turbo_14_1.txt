To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more often over many rounds of the game, we calculate the number of ways the 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed to children A, B, and C according to the distribution described in each case. We use combinations here because the order in which each child receives the balls doesn't matter, while still taking into account that the balls themselves are distinguishable.

### Case 1
Children A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.

Using the combinatorial formula \(\binom{n}{k}\) where \(n\) is the total number of items to choose from and \(k\) is the number of items to choose, the number of ways to distribute balls in case 1 can be calculated as:
1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. Choose 2 balls for C out of the remaining 2: \(\binom{2}{2}\)

Hence, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

### Case 2
Child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. Choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

Hence, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, it is evident that:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, case 1 (where each child gets 2 balls) is more likely to occur compared to case 2. Thus, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
