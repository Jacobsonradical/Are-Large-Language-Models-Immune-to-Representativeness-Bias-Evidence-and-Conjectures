To answer this question, let us calculate the number of ways each case can occur. 

**Case 1: 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, 2 balls to C**

The number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is calculated as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
3. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 for child C. This can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, 1 ball to C**

The number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
3. Choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 for child C. This can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Since there are 90 possible outcomes in Case 1 and 60 possible outcomes in Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game. 

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
