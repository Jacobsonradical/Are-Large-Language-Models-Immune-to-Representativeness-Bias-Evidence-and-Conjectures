To find out whether Case 1 or Case 2 will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in these scenarios. 

For each case, the result depends on how the balls, which are distinguishable, can be allocated to children A, B, and C according to the specified distributions.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

The total number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls can be computed using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} \]
This expression calculates the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and finally the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C:
\[ \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

The formula to use here is also a multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} \]
This formula calculates the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last remaining ball goes to child C:
\[ \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = 60 \]

Finally comparing the results â€“ Case 1 results in 90 possible distributions, and Case 2 results in 60 possible distributions. Therefore, there are more results fitting the distribution in Case 1 than in Case 2.
