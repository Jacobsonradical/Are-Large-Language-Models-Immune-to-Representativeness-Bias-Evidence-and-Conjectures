To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can be realized.

Each of the six balls is distinct, and it can go to any of the three children. There are a total of \(3^6\) or 729 different ways to distribute the six balls among the three children A, B, and C.

**Case 1:** The distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2.
To find the number of ways to achieve this:
1. Choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls will go to C: \(\binom{2}{2}\)

The total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2:** The distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1.
To find the number of ways to achieve this:
1. Choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining ball will go to C: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

The total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) can occur in 90 ways.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) can occur in 60 ways.

Thus, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 because 90 is greater than 60.

Answer: {case: 1}
