To solve this, we need to find out how many ways each case can happen and then compare the two results.

**Case 1**: The balls are distributed such that each child receives 2 balls.
- Children A, B, C each need to be assigned 2 out of the 6 balls. First, choose 2 balls for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Then choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Finally, assign the last 2 balls to child C. There's only \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to do this.
- So, the total number of ways for case 1 is \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2**: The balls are distributed such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
- Choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
- Finally, give the last remaining ball to child C. Thereâ€™s \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to do this.
- So, the total number of ways for case 2 is \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing the total number of ways for both cases, case 1 has 90 ways and case 2 has 60 ways.

So, there will be more results of **case 1** than case 2. 

Answer: {case: 1}
