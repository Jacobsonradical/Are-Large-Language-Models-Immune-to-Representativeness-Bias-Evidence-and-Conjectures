To determine which case will appear more frequently, we need to calculate how many ways each specific distribution of balls can occur, and compare these numbers.

Let's start with **case 1**:
- Distribution: A:2, B:2, C:2
- To find out how many ways we can distribute the 6 balls into this pattern, we choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A, then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B, and the last 2 automatically go to C. 
  The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \). Then, we need to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for B, which is \( \binom{4}{2} \). Since the last 2 balls go to C automatically, no combination operation is needed for C.
  Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is: \( \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 \).

Now, let's consider **case 2**:
- Distribution: A:2, B:3, C:1
- We select 2 balls from the 6 for A, which again uses \( \binom{6}{2} \). Next, from the remaining 4 balls, we select 3 for B, which uses \( \binom{4}{3} \). Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C. 
  So, the total number of ways to distribute in case 2 is \( \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \).

This calculation reveals that **case 1** (A:2, B:2, C:2), with 90 ways to occur, appears more frequently than **case 2** (A:2, B:3, C:1), which has 60 ways.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
