To solve this problem, we evaluate the likelihood of the different cases (case 1 and case 2) occurring based on the distribution described.

**Calculating for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is denoted as C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and we choose 2 out of those for child B, denoted as C(4,2), and the last 2 automatically go to child C.

Using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], we can calculate:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15
C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6

The total number of favorable outcomes for case 1:
15 (ways to choose for A) × 6 (ways to choose for B) × 1 (way for C) = 90.

**Calculating for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

For child A choosing 2 balls: C(6,2) = 15 (as calculated above).

For child B choosing 3 out of the remaining 4 balls: C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = (4 * 3 * 2) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 4

For child C, there is only one ball left, so there’s just 1 way to choose it: C(1,1) = 1.

The total number of favorable outcomes for case 2:
15 (ways to choose for A) × 4 (ways to choose for B) × 1 (way for C) = 60.

When comparing the results:
- Case 1 yields 90 possible ways.
- Case 2 yields 60 possible ways.

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
