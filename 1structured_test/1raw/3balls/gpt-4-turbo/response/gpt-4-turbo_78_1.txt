To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur, given that there are 6 distinguishable balls.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

First, we choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this. After this, we have 4 balls left, and we choose 2 out of these 4 balls to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this. Finally, the remaining 2 balls go to C, which can happen in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways. Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

First, we choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this. After that, we have 4 balls remaining, and we choose 3 out of these 4 balls to give to B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this. The remaining 1 ball goes to C, which can happen in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways. Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Comparing the number of ways:
- There are 90 ways for Case 1
- There are 60 ways for Case 2

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
