To solve this question, we need to determine the probability of each case (1 and 2) happening per round of the game.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We find all possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. 

First, let's choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A. There are \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways to make this selection. After selecting 2 balls for A, 4 balls remain. We then choose 2 out of these remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, and this can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

The total number of ways for case 1 is therefore:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We find all possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. 

We choose 2 balls for A from 6, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways. Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we select 3 for B, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways. Finally, the last remaining ball automatically goes to C, and this can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \) way.

The total number of ways for case 2 is therefore:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

**Comparison**: 

Case 1 has 90 ways, and case 2 has 60 ways. 

Since there are more ways for case 1 to happen than for case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
