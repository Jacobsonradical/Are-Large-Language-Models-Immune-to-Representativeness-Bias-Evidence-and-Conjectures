To determine the likelihood of each case happening, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the balls among the children according to the specified cases.

**For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
- First choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
- The final 2 balls will automatically go to child C. So, there is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to give the remaining balls to child C.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]

Calculating:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15,
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6,
\binom{2}{2} = 1.
\]

Thus:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}.
\]

**For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
- The final ball will automatically go to child C. So, there is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to give the remaining ball to child C.

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]

Calculating:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 (as before),
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4,
\binom{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}.
\]

**Conclusion**:
Since 90 ways (Case 1) is greater than 60 ways (Case 2), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
