To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur by treating it as a combinatorial problem. We aim to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among children A, B, and C according to the specified distributions in each case.

**For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. The number of ways to do this is calculated by the combination \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 to give to B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. The final 2 balls go to C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
1. Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 to give to B. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. The final 1 ball goes to C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has 90 ways and case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) will occur more frequently than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer:
{case: 1}
