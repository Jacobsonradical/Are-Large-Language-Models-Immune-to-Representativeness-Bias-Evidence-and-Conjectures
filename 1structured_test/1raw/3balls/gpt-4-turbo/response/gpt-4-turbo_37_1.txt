To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur.

In **case 1** where the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2:
- Each child receives exactly two balls.
- We can calculate the number of distributions by selecting 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the final 2 automatically go to C.

This number of distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient, calculated as:
\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!} = \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90.
\]

In **case 2** where the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1:
- A receives 2, B receives 3, and C receives 1 ball.
- We can calculate the number of distributions by selecting 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the final 1 goes to C.

This number of distributions is given by:
\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times 1 = \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60.
\]

Comparison:
- Case 1 has \(90\) ways, while case 2 has \(60\) ways.

From the computations:
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
So, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.
