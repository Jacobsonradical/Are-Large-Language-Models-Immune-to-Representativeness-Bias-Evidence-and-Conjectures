To determine whether case 1 or case 2 occurs more often, we need to calculate the number of different ways each case can happen. The balls are distinguishable, and each child can receive a certain number of them. 

For each case, we calculate the number of arrangements using combinations, which count how many ways we can choose a subset of balls to give to each child, considering the specific number of balls they receive.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- First, choose 2 out of the 6 balls for A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls for B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Finally, the last 2 balls will go to C. This can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.
- Total ways = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Choose 2 out of the 6 balls for A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 3 of the remaining 4 balls for B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- Lastly, the last 1 ball will go to C. This can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.
- Total ways = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \(\binom{4}{3}\) \times \(\binom{1}{1}\) = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing these results:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Since case 1 has more possible arrangements than case 2, it follows that in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
