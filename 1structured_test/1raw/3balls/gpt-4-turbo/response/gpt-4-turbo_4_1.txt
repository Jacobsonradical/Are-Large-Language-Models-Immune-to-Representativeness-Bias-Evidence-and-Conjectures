To determine whether case 1 or case 2 happens more frequently, we need to calculate how many ways each case can occur and then compare these numbers.

The total number of different ways we can distribute 6 balls to three children is the multinomial coefficient that arises from the multinomial distribution. This coefficient \(\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, k_3}\) calculates the number of ways to distribute \(n\) distinguishable items into groups of sizes \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\), where \(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = n\).

**Case 1:** The balls are distributed as follows: A:2, B:2, C:2.

The number of ways we can distribute the balls in this manner is represented by the multinomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2, 2, 2}\), which is computed as:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]
This means there are 90 different ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

**Case 2:** The balls are distributed as follows: A:2, B:3, C:1.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this configuration is \(\binom{6}{2, 3, 1}\), computed as:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]
This means there are 60 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

**Comparison:**
From the calculations above, we see that the case with \(A:2, B:2, C:2\) (Case 1) occurs more frequently than the case with \(A:2, B:3, C:1\) (Case 2).

Therefore:
{case: 1}
