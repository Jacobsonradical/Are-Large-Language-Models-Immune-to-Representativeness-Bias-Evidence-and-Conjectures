To find out which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur, then compare those amounts.

1. **Calculating for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
   - First, choose 2 balls out of the 6 balls for child A. 
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
   - Next, out of the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
   - Lastly, the remaining 2 balls go to child C: \(\binom{2}{2}\) (which is 1 as there is exactly one way to choose 2 balls from 2).
   - Total combinations for case 1 are: \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}\).
   - Compute this as \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

2. **Calculating for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
   - First, choose 2 balls for child A from 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
   - Then, choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
   - Lastly, the remaining 1 ball is for child C: \(\binom{1}{1}\) (also 1 as there is exactly one way to choose 1 ball from 1).
   - Total combinations for case 2 are: \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}\).
   - Compute this as \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Since \(90 > 60\), case 1 (where each child receives 2 balls) will occur more frequently.
