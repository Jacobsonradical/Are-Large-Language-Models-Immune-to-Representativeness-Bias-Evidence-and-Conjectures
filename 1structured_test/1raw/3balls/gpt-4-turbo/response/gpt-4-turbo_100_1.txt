To determine whether there will be more outcomes of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur, based on the combinatorial possibilities.

**Calculating for Case 1 — (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The last 2 balls will go to child C: There is only 1 way to give the remaining 2 balls to child C, namely \(\binom{2}{2}\).

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in the order A, B, C in Case 1, is given by multiplying these combinations:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

However, since there are no restrictions on the order of choice, 
the final count for Case 1 remains 90.

**Calculating for Case 2 — (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The last ball will go to child C: There is only 1 way to give the last ball to child C, namely \(\binom{1}{1}\).

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in the order A, B, C in Case 2, is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**

Case 1 has 90 ways and Case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
