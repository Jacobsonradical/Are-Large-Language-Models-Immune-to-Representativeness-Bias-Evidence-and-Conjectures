To answer which case will appear more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each scenario can occur.

Letâ€™s start with case 1 where each child receives exactly 2 balls.

**Case 1 -- A:2, B:2, C:2**

The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to child A from 6 balls is \(\binom{6}{2}\) (selecting 2 balls from 6).
After giving 2 balls to A, 4 balls are left, from which 2 balls need to be given to child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, which can happen in only \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this fashion is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2 -- A:2, B:3, C:1**

First, choose 2 balls for child A out of 6, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
Then choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
Finally, the last remaining ball is for child C, done in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

The number of ways for this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Thus, **case 1** occurs more frequently than case 2. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
