To determine which case will appear more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each specific case can occur when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children.

**Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2**
To determine the number of ways we can distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we use combinatorial calculations:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\).
3. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 for child C: \(\binom{2}{2}\).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1**
For this arrangement, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\).
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\).
3. Choose 1 ball from remaining 1 for child C: \(\binom{1}{1}\).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing both cases:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 ways.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 ways.

Based on these calculations:
{case: 1}
