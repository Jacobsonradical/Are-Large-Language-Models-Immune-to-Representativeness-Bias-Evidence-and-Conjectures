To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the total number of ways each case could occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

To find the total number of distributions for this case, we need to determine:
- How to pick 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A.
- How to pick 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B.
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \). Likewise, the number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for B is \( \binom{4}{2} \). The final 2 balls that go to C do not need any selection because they are the only ones left.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 can be computed as:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

In this scenario, we need to:
- Pick 2 out of the 6 balls for A.
- Pick 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B.
- The last remaining ball goes to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} \), and to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Comparing the Two Cases:**

From the calculations:
- Number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) = 90
- Number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) = 60

Since the number of ways to achieve Case 1 is higher than Case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
