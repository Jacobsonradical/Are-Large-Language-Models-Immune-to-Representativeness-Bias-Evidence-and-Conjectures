To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability or the number of ways each case can occur and compare them. Let's find the number of ways in which each case can happen:

**Case 1: A=2, B=2, C=2**
We need to choose:
- 2 balls out of 6 for child A,
- 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B,
- The last 2 automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this pattern can be computed using binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]
So, for this case:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A=2, B=3, C=1**
We need to choose:
- 2 balls out of 6 for child A,
- 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B,
- The last ball goes to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this pattern is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \text{ (same as before)}
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]
So, for this case:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the number of ways:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) = 90 ways
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) = 60 ways

Since there are more ways that case 1 can occur than case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
