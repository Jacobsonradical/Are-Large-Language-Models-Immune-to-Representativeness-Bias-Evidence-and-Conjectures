To determine which of the two cases will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of different ways each scenario (case 1 and case 2) can occur. 

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
For this case, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. We choose 2 balls for Child A from 6, then 2 balls for Child B from the remaining 4, and the last 2 balls go to Child C. The count can be calculated using combinations:

- Number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, so only 1 way: \(\binom{2}{2}\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this way is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
In this case, we have a different distribution: 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. 

- Number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- The remaining ball goes to C, so only 1 way: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this way is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- **Case 1** has 90 ways
- **Case 2** has 60 ways

Case 1 occurs more frequently given the higher number of combinations possible for distributing the balls equally among the three children.

**Answer: {case: 1}**
