To answer this question, we need to calculate and compare the number of ways the balls can be distributed under the conditions specified in each case. We consider that each ball is distinguishable, and the children are distinguishable, too.

**Case 1:** Each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which gives us the number of ways to distribute the balls among the three children:

\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls as in case 1.

**Case 2:** Child A receives 2 balls, Child B receives 3 balls, and Child C receives 1 ball. Again, we use the multinomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls as in case 2.

**Comparison:** We see that there are more possible distributions for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
{case: 1}
