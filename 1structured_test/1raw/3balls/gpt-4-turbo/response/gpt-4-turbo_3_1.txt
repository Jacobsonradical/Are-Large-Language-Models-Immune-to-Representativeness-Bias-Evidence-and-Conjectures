To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen and compare them.

**For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
We need to find all the ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient, which for distributing \( n \) items into groups of sizes \( k_1, k_2, \dots, k_r \) is given by
\[
\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! ... k_r!}
\]
For Case 1, the calculation is
\[
\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
Here, we distribute the 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The calculation is:
\[
\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- Case 1 results in 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 results in 60 possible distributions.

Since 90 (the number of distributions in Case 1) is greater than 60 (the number of distributions in Case 2), there will be more results of **Case 1** than Case 2. Therefore, the answer is:
    
{case: 1}
