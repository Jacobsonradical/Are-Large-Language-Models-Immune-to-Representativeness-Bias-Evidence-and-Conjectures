To answer this question, we need to compare the number of ways in which 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed among 3 children A, B, and C according to the distribution patterns given in cases 1 and 2.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
First, we choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. After giving 2 balls to A, 4 balls are left, from which we choose 2 balls to give to child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, which can only be done in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way. Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Then choose 3 of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. The last ball goes to child C, which can only be done in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way. Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

By comparing the total possible ways:
- **Case 1**: 90 ways
- **Case 2**: 60 ways

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 since 90 > 60. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
