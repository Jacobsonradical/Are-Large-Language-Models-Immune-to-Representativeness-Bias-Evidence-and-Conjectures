In this problem, we aim to determine which case will have more possible outcomes after multiple rounds of distribution of 6 distinguishable balls among three children: A, B, and C. Each distribution pattern you presented describes a different scenario: 

- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To solve this, we'll compute the number of ways each distribution can occur, using the combinations formula:

Number of ways (nCr) = n! / [r! * (n-r)!]

**Case 1:**
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6 choose 2 = 6! / [2! * (6-2)!] = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
- After giving 2 balls to child A, 4 balls remain. Choose 2 balls out of 4 for child B: 4 choose 2 = 4! / [2! * (4-2)!] = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. So, 2 choose 2 = 1 way (though this step is generally trivial since no choice is needed).

The number of ways to distribute in Case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

**Case 2:**
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways (similar calculation as in Case 1).
- After giving 2 balls to child A, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4 choose 3 = 4! / [3! * (4-3)!] = (4*3*2) / (3*2) = 4 ways.
- The remaining 1 ball goes to child C: 1 choose 1 = 1 way.

The number of ways to distribute in Case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Clearly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) is higher than for Case 2 (60 ways). 

Hence, the answer is:
{case: 1}
