To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways each distribution can happen. This can be done using combinatorics.

**Case 1:** A:2, B:2, C:2
Here we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 2 balls to child B, and 2 balls to child C.
- First, choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Finally, the last 2 balls go to child C, which is done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Calculating these:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6
\]
\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2:** A:2, B:3, C:1
- First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways = 15 ways.
- Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways = 4 ways.
- Finally, the last ball goes to child C, done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways = 1 way.

Calculating these:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Since 90 is greater than 60, case 1 will occur more often than case 2. Thus:

{case: 1}
