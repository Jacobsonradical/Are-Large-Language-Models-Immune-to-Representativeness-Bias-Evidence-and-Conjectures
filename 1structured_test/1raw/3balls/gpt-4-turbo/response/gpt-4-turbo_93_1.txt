To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we can compute the number of ways each distribution can happen.

For both cases, we have 6 distinguishable balls, and we are interested in how these can be distributed to children A, B, and C according to the two patterns mentioned.

### Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)
- First, select 2 balls for child A from the 6 available. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, select 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Finally, the last 2 balls go to child C, and this can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) = 1 way.

The total number of ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)
- Select 2 balls for child A from the 6 available. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, select 3 of the remaining 4 balls for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- Finally, the last remaining ball goes to child C, and this can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) = 1 way.

The total number of ways to achieve the distribution in case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Comparing the totals for both cases, case 1 can happen in 90 ways, and case 2 can happen in 60 ways. Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.

Thus, the final answer is:
{case: 1}
