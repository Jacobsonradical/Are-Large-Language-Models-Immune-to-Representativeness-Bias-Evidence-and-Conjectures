To determine which case will occur more frequently when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children, we need to calculate the probability of each case by understanding how many ways each distribution can occur and compare them.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
Each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways in which we can distribute the balls such that each child ends up with exactly 2 balls can be calculated by first choosing 2 balls to go to child A, then choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and then assigning the last 2 balls to child C.

Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
Number of ways for C to get the remaining 2 balls is fixed as \(\binom{2}{2}\) = 1 (only 1 way).

Thus, Case 1 total arrangements = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}= 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Child A gets 2 balls, Child B gets 3 balls, and Child C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
Number of ways for C to get the remaining ball is \(\binom{1}{1}\) = 1.

Thus, Case 2 total arrangements = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing the number of ways for each case:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls as in Case 1, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
