To determine which case will more frequently occur, we need to count the number of ways balls can be distributed to each child according to the cases.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- For child A, we choose 2 balls from 6. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- For child B, we now choose 2 balls from the remaining 4. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- For child C, the only choice is the remaining 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{2}{2}\).

The total number of ways for Case 1 is 
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- For child A, we again choose 2 balls from 6, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- For child B, we must now choose 3 balls from the remaining 4, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- For child C, the only choice is to take the last remaining ball, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) way.

The total number of ways for Case 2 is 
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), we can conlude that Case 1 will occur more frequently.

Answer: {case: 1}
