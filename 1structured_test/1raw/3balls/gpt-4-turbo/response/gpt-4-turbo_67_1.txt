To determine which case will have more results, we need to compute the number of ways each distribution can occur. We use combinatorics for this purpose.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

The process to calculate this involves:
1. Choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A: this can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choosing 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: this can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C, and this can be done in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

The process to calculate this involves:
1. Choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A: this can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choosing 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: this can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The last ball automatically goes to C, and this can be done in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 2:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has \(90\) ways
- Case 2 has \(60\) ways

Thus, there will be more results of Case 1 than of Case 2.

**Answer format:**  
{case: 1}
