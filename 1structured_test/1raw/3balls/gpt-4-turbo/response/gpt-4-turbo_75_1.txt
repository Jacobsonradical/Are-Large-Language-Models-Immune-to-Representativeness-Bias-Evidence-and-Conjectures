To answer the question, we need to calculate the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed among children A, B, and C according to the two different cases specified:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- The number of ways two specific balls can be assigned to child A, another two specific balls to child B, and the remaining two to child C is computed as follows:
  - There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A.
  - There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B.
  - There remain \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to assign the last 2 balls to child C.
  - Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
  \[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- The number of ways two specific balls can be assigned to child A, three specific balls to child B, and one to child C is as follows:
  - There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A.
  - There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B.
  - There remains \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to assign the last ball to child C.
  - Thus, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
  \[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60. \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Thus, there are more results of case 1 than case 2.
