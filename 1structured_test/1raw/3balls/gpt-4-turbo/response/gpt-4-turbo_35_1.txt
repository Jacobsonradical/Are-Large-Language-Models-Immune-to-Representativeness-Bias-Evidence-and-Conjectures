To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of different ways each specific distribution can happen.

**Case 1:** The distribution A:2, B:2, C:2.
- We find the number of ways to choose 2 balls from the total 6 balls for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \).
- Then choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B: \( \binom{4}{2} \).
- The last 2 balls automatically go to child C: \( \binom{2}{2} \).

To calculate:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways for case 1 is \( 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \).

**Case 2:** The distribution A:2, B:3, C:1.
- Choose 2 balls from the total 6 balls for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \).
- Then choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B: \( \binom{4}{3} \).
- The last ball automatically goes to child C: \( \binom{1}{1} \).

To calculate:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]  (as calculated above)
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \] 
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the number of ways for case 2 is \( 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \).

**Conclusion:** Case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2, happening in 90 ways as opposed to 60.
