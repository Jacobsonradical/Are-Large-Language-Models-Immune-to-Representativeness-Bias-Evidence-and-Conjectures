To answer which case (1 or 2) will occur more frequently when distributing 6 distinguishable balls randomly to children A, B, and C, we need to calculate the number of ways each of the distributions can occur and compare these numbers.

**Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2**
To find the number of distributions, we need to calculate how many ways we can assign 2 distinct balls from the group of 6 to each child. Using the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \( \binom{4}{2} \)
- The last 2 balls automatically go to child C: \( \binom{2}{2} \)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1**
Again using the same combinatorial approach:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: \( \binom{6}{2} \)
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: \( \binom{4}{3} \)
- The last ball automatically goes to child C: \( \binom{1}{1} \)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the numbers:
- Case 1 results in 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 results in 60 possible distributions.

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), **there will be more results of case 1 than case 2**.
Thus, the answer to your question is:

{case: 1}
