To solve this question, we need to compute the probability of each distribution case happening by figuring out the number of ways each distribution can occur, and then compare them.

**For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
- We need to choose 2 balls for each child from the 6 distinct balls.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- For child C, there are \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to choose the remaining 2 balls.

The total number of distributions for Case 1 is therefore: 
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
\]

**For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
- We need to choose 2 balls from 6 for child A, 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball for child C.
- There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 balls for A.
- There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for B.
- There is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to choose the 1 remaining ball for C.

The total number of distributions for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

**Comparison**:
The total number of outcomes favoring Case 1 (90 outcomes) is more than the total number of outcomes for Case 2 (60 outcomes).

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
