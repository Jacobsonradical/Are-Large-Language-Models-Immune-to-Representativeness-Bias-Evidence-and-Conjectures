To find out whether case 1 or case 2 occurs more frequently, let's compute the number of ways each distribution can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We have 6 distinguishable balls and we need to distribute them such that each of A, B, and C gets exactly 2 balls each. We can compute this using the following logic:
- Choose 2 balls for A out of 6. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The computation is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, the distribution is such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1 ball. This can be computed as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A out of 6. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

The computation is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

**Conclusion:**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) results in 90 ways, whereas Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) results in 60 ways. Therefore, case 1 occurs more frequently.

Answer: `{case: 1}`
