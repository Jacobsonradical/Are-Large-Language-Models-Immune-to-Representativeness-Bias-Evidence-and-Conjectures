To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of distinct outcomes for each case. For this, we consider the distinguishable nature of the six balls and the specific distribution of balls to each child as described in the cases.

**Calculation for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
- We choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- From the remaining 4 balls, we choose 2 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C: \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

Calculation:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15\)
- \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\)
- \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

Total outcomes for Case 1:
- \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Calculation for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
- Choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A: \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 to give to child B: \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- The last remaining ball goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

Calculation:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) (same as above).
- \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4\).
- \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

Total outcomes for Case 2:
- \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

**Comparison and Conclusion:**
- Case 1 (90 outcomes) has more possible ways than Case 2 (60 outcomes).
Thus, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results matching the distribution of Case 1 than Case 2.

**Formatted Answer:**
{case: 1}
