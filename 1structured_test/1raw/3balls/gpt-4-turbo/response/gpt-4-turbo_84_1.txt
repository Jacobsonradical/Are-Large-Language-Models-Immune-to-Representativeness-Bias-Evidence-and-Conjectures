To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to compute the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed according to the specifications of each case.

For each case, the number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient. The multinomial coefficient is used when an event is divided into multiple categories, and it is computed as:

\[
\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to distribute, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the number of items in each category.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- Here, we distribute 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C.
- Using the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\text{Ways for Case 1} = \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Here, we distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C.
- Using the multinomial coefficient:
\[
\text{Ways for Case 2} = \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**
Comparing the number of ways:
- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has 90 ways.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has 60 ways.

Since 90 > 60, Case 1 will have more results in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is: {case: 1}
