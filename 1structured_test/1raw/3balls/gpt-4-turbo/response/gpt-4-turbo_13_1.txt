To find the number of ways each case can occur, we need to calculate the number of combinations in which 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed among three children (A, B, C) in accordance with the ratios outlined in each case.

First, let's look at:

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- The first step is to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A. The number of ways to do this is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

Thus, the total number of combinations for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- Finally, the last ball automatically goes to C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

Thus, the total number of combinations for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 occurs in 90 ways.
- Case 2 occurs in 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
