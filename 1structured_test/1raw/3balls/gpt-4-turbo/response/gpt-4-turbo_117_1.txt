To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case and then compare them.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
For this distribution, we must choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A, then choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and finally assign the last 2 balls to child C. The number of ways to do this is calculated as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
- The last 2 automatically go to C: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)

Using the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), we find:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15\)
- \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\)

Multiply these together to get the total number of ways: \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
Here, the steps and calculations are:
- Choose 2 balls for A: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
- The last 1 ball goes to C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\)

Calculating these:
- \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) (as before)
- \(\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4\)

Multiply these together to get the total number of ways: \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

**Conclusion:**
Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, and Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes. Since 90 > 60, case 1 happens more frequently.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
