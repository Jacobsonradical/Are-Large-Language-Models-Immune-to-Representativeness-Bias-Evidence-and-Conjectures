To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case, and determine which one occurs more frequently.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We compute the number of different ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to three children such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. 

- First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
- Finally, assign the remaining 2 balls to child C. There is only \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to do this.

So, the number of ways this can be done is \(\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2}\).

\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1.

- Choose 2 balls for child A. \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
- Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
- Assign the remaining 1 ball to child C. \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

\[
\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{3} \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

Since we have 90 ways for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 (where A, B, and C each gets 2 balls) has more possible outcomes than Case 2 (where A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
