To determine in which case there will be more results, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed to the children according to the two cases you've presented. To do this, we use the concept from combinatorics known as the "multinomial coefficient."

The multinomial coefficient calculates the number of ways to distribute a total of \( n \) objects into \( r \) groups where the groups have specified sizes \( n_1, n_2, ..., n_r \) (where \( \sum_{i=1}^r n_i = n \)). The formula for the multinomial coefficient is:

\[ \binom{n}{n_1, n_2,..., n_r} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times ... \times n_r!} \]

**Case 1** - Child A gets 2 balls, Child B gets 2 balls, and Child C gets 2 balls:
Using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

**Case 2** - Child A gets 2 balls, Child B gets 3 balls, and Child C gets 1 ball:
Using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

Comparing the results from Case 1 and Case 2:
- Case 1 (Equal distribution) results in 90 ways.
- Case 2 (Unequal distribution) results in 60 ways.

Based on the calculations, there are more possible outcomes where each of the three children gets exactly 2 balls (Case 1), compared to the situation in Case 2 where the distribution among the children is uneven.

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
