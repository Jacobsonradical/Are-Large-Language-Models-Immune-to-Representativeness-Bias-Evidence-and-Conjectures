To find out whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the probability of each specific distribution occurring when the balls are distributed at random. Another useful method is to count the number of ways each specific case can occur, reflecting these probabilities.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

The number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls can be found using the multinomial coefficient. The formula for the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

Similarly, calculating for this case where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3, and C receives 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\binom{6}{2,3,1} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Since case 1 yields 90 ways to distribute the balls and case 2 gives 60 ways, case 1 appears more frequently than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
