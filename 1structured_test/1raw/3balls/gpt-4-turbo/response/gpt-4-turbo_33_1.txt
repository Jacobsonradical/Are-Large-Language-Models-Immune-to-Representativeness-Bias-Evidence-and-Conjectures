To determine which case is more probable, we can calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and compare them.

**Case 1: Distribution of A:2, B:2, C:2**
To find the number of ways 6 distinguishable balls can be distributed among A, B, C such that each child receives exactly 2 balls, we first select 2 balls out of the 6 for child A, then select 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} \).
The number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls is \( \binom{4}{2} \).
Finally, the last 2 balls can only go to one child, in only one way: \( \binom{2}{2} \).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
\( \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \) ways.

**Case 2: Distribution of A:2, B:3, C:1**
Similarly, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} \).
The number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} \).
The final ball can only go one way: \( \binom{1}{1} \).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
\( \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \) ways.

**Comparison and Answer:**
Case 1 has 90 ways of distributing the balls, and Case 2 has only 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
