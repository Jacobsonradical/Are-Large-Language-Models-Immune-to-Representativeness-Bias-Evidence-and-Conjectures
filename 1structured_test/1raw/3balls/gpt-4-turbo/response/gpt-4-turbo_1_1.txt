To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways each case (distribution of balls among children A, B, and C) can occur.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
To calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls, we can consider selecting 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to B, and finally, the last 2 balls will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\). Once this is done, the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). The last 2 balls automatically going to C doesn't involve a choice, so this step is counted as \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times 1 = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
This arrangement involves selecting 2 out of the 6 balls for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and finally the last remaining ball will automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to give 2 balls to child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). To give 3 balls to B out of the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\), and giving the last ball to C is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls as in Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times 1 = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparison:**
Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes. Therefore, Case 1 occurs more frequently than Case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
