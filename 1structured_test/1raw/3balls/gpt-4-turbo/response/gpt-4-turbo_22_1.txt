To solve this, we need to calculate the number of ways in which the balls can be distributed to each child according to the specified cases and then compare those numbers.

1. **Calculation for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    - We need to select 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is denoted by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).
    - Next, we choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is denoted by \(\binom{4}{2}\).
    - Finally, there are exactly 2 balls left, all of which will go to child C. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 2 is \(\binom{2}{2}\).

    The total number of distributions for Case 1 is:
    \[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
    \]

2. **Calculation for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    - We select 2 balls for A from 6 balls, so the number of ways is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
    - Next, we choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls. The number of ways to choose 3 balls from 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
    - Finally, there is 1 ball left, which will go to child C. The number of ways to choose 1 ball from 1 is \(\binom{1}{1}\).

    The total number of distributions for Case 2 is:
    \[
    \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
    \]

Since we computed 90 ways for **Case 1** and 60 ways for **Case 2**, it is evident that there will be more results of Case 1 in the game.

Hence, the formatted answer is:
{case: 1}
