To determine which case will occur more frequently, we compute the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare these numbers.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

For Case 1, we distribute 2 balls each to A, B, and C. We calculate the number of ways to do this as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \text{ ways}
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

For Case 2, we distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C:
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The last ball automatically goes to C.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \text{ ways}
\]

**Conclusion:**

Since \(90\) ways for Case 1 is greater than \(60\) ways for Case 2, Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game. Thus, the answer is:
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
