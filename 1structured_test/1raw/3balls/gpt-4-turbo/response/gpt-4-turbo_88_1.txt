To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways that each case can occur by considering all possible distributions of the balls that follow the case's condition.

Each child is distinguishable, and the balls themselves are distinguishable. Letâ€™s calculate how many possible distributions there are for each case:

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
Each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated by choosing 2 balls from 6 for the first child, then 2 balls from the remaining 4 for the second child, and finally the last 2 balls automatically go to the third child. Thus, the number of ways for case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} \]
\[ 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90 \text{ ways} \]

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B 3 balls, and child C 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls here is calculated by choosing 2 balls from 6 for child A, then choosing 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C. Thus, the number of ways for case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60 \text{ ways} \]

**Comparison:**
From the calculations, we have:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 because the number of distributions for case 1 is greater. So, the answer is:
{case: 1}
