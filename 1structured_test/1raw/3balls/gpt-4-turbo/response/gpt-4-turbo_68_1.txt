To compare the two cases, we need to quantify how many different ways each distribution of balls can be achieved. Each ball is distinguishable, so each has a unique place it can be assigned.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We want to count how many ways we can distribute 6 distinct balls such that A, B, and C each get exactly 2 balls. We first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 are automatically assigned to child C. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations (since the order within each child's set of balls does not matter):
\[ \text{Ways for A} = \binom{6}{2}, \text{Ways for B} = \binom{4}{2}, \text{Ways for C} = \binom{2}{2}. \]
Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
We now count the ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. We choose 2 balls for A from the 6, then 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, and the last ball for C:
\[ \text{Ways for A} = \binom{6}{2}, \text{Ways for B} = \binom{4}{3}, \text{Ways for C} = \binom{1}{1}. \]
Thus, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

Comparing the two cases:
- **Case 1** has 90 possible outcomes.
- **Case 2** has 60 possible outcomes.

Conclusion: There are more results of case 1 than case 2, due to the greater number of ways to achieve that particular distribution.
