To find out in which case there will be more results, let's calculate the number of ways we can distribute the balls as described in each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
We distribute 6 distinguishable balls so that each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

Number of ways = \( \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} \)

Where \( 6! \) accounts for the ordering of all 6 balls, and each \( 2! \) represents the ordering among the balls each child receives, which we divide out because these orderings are not distinguished in the counting.

Calculation:
\( 6! = 720 \)
\( 2! = 2 \)
\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Here, we give 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. The number of ways is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Number of ways = \( \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} \)

Where \( 6! \) represents the ordering of all 6 balls, \( 2! \) for A’s balls, \( 3! \) for B’s balls, and \( 1! \) for C’s ball.

Calculation:
\( 2! = 2; 3! = 6; 1! = 1 \)
\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Thus, in many rounds of the game, **Case 1** will result in more outcomes where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2 compared to Case 2 where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1.

Finally, the format:
