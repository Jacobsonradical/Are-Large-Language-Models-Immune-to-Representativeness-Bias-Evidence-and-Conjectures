To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to find out the number of ways each distribution can occur, and compare these numbers.

For **case 1** where A, B, and C each get 2 of the 6 distinct balls:

1. Choose 2 balls to give to A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 2 balls to give to B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. There are 2 balls left, which go to C, and this can happen in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way.

Thus, the total number of ways for this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

For **case 2** where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:

1. Choose 2 balls to give to A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls to give to B from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball goes to C, and this can happen in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way.

Thus, the total number of ways for this distribution is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two totals, the case where each child gets exactly 2 balls (case 1) has 90 possibilities, whereas the case with 2-3-1 distribution (case 2) has 60 possibilities.

Hence, there will be more rounds with the distribution of {A:2, B:2, C:2} (case 1) than rounds with the distribution {A:2, B:3, C:1} (case 2).

The answer in the required format is:
{case: 1}
