To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will have more results over many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur, and compare their quantities.

In each round, every ball can go to any one of the three children, making a total of \(3^6 = 729\) possible outcomes (since each of the 6 balls has 3 choices).

**Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2:**
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). 
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\).
- The number of ways the last 2 balls go to child C is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) (only one way).
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is \(\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1:**
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to go to child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to go to child B, and the last ball goes to child C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\).
- The number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{3}\).
- The number of ways the last ball goes to child C is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is \(\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing these two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways.
- Case 2: 60 ways.

From this analysis, you can see that there are more results possible in case 1 than in case 2 over many rounds of the game due to the greater number of combinations.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
