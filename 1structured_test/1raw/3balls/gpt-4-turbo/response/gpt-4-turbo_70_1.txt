The problem involves distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. We shall compute the number of ways to achieve each of the specified distributions (case 1 and case 2) and then compare the results.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

The number of ways to assign 2 balls out of 6 to child A is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). After assigning 2 balls to child A, 4 balls remain. The number of ways to assign 2 out of these 4 balls to child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). This leaves 2 balls, which must go to child C, and there is exactly \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to assign these balls. Therefore, the number of different ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90. \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

The number of ways to assign 2 balls out of 6 to child A is again \(\binom{6}{2}\). After assigning 2 balls to child A, 4 balls remain. The number of ways to assign 3 out of these 4 balls to child B is \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\). This leaves 1 ball, which must go to child C, and there is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to assign this ball. Therefore, the number of different ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60. \]

Comparing these numbers:
- **Case 1:** 90 ways
- **Case 2:** 60 ways

Since 90 (case 1) is larger than 60 (case 2), there will be more results fitting the distribution of "**A:2, B:2, C:2**".

Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
