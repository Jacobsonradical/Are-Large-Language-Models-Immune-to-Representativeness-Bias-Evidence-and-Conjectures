To solve the query, I will calculate the probability for each case and determine which is more likely to occur over numerous rounds.

In each case, we are looking at how the 6 distinguishable balls are distributed among children A, B, and C with specific counts.

**For case 1**:
- A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls this way can be calculated by first choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 automatically go to C. Using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \) which is the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order, we calculate:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**For case 2**:
- A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Similarly, we choose 2 balls for A from 6, then 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, and the last ball goes to C:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Hence, for the total number of possible outcomes in each round, we have:
90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2.

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more outcomes in case 1 when considering many rounds of the game.


Therefore, the answer to your query is:
{case: 1}
