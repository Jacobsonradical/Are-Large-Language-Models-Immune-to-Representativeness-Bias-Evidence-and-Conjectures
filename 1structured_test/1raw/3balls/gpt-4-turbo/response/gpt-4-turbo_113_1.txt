To determine which case is more probable, let's calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
1. Choose 2 balls from the 6 balls for child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Now choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
1. Choose 2 balls from the 6 balls for child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. Choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Now, comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways of occurring.
- Case 2 has 60 ways of occurring.

Hence, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1, since there are more ways for this case to occur than case 2.
