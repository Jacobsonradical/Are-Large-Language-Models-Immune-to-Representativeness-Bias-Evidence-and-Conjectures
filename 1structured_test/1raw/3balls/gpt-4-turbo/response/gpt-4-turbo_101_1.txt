To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each specific distribution of balls can occur, and then compare these quantities.

**Case 1 --- Distribution A:2, B:2, C:2**
For this distribution, we need to pick:
- 2 balls out of the 6 for child A,
- 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and,
- the last 2 balls automatically go to child C.

We calculate it as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The last 2 balls automatically go to child C, but this still counts as 1 way to pick (\(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)).

So, the number of ways to arrange the balls as in case 1:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2 --- Distribution A:2, B:3, C:1**
For this distribution:
- Pick 2 balls for child A from 6,
- Pick 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4,
- The last 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

We calculate it as follows:
1. Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The last 1 ball automatically goes to child C: \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

So, the number of ways to arrange the balls as in case 2:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Comparison:**
From these computations, there are more possible results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways). Hence, in many rounds of the game, there will be more outcomes of case 1.

Answer:
{case: 1}
