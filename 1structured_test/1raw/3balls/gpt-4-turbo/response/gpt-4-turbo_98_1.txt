To answer this question, let's compute the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case, and then determine which of the two cases (Case 1 or Case 2) will have more results over many rounds of the game.

**Case 1**
Here, children A, B, and C each get 2 balls. Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, we need to choose 2 balls to give to child A, 2 balls to give to child B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After giving 2 balls to A, there are 4 balls left, and the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4 for child B is \(\binom{4}{2}\). The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

Using the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\),
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 4!} = 15,
\]
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2! \times 2!} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[
15 \times 6 = 90.
\]

**Case 2**
Here, children A, B, and C get 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively. Again, using the combination formula, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15 \quad \text{(same as Case 1)},
\]
\[
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3! \times 1!} = 4.
\]
\[
\binom{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Hence, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 because it has more possible arrangements.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
