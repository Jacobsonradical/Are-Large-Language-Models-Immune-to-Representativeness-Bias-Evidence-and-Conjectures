To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of possible ways each distribution can occur. Each scenario requires computing combinations of how balls can be assigned to each child following the distribution pattern described.

### For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)

We can select 2 balls for A out of the 6 in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we select 2 for B in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. Finally, for C, we take the last 2 balls in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways. The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)

We select 2 balls for A out of 6 in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Then, from the remaining 4 balls, we select 3 for B in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. Finally, for C, we select 1 ball from the remaining ball in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways. The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion

Comparing the total possibilities for each case:

- Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) results in 90 ways.
- Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) results in 60 ways.

Therefore, distribution as in case 1 happens more frequently than in case 2. Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
