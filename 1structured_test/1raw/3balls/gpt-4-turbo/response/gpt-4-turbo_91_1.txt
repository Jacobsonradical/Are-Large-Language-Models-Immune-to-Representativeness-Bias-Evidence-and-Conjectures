To determine which case will occur more frequently in the described game, we need to calculate the number of different ways each distribution of balls can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**\
First, we choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A, which can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways (where \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents a combination, the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to order). After assigning 2 balls to A, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. Finally, the last 2 balls go to child C, and this can happen in \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way. Thus, the total number of outcomes for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**\
We first choose 2 balls out of the 6 to give to child A in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways. Then choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways. The last ball, which goes to child C, can be assigned in \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way. Thus, the total number of outcomes for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Since \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 90 > 60 = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3}\), we see that the set of circumstances described in Case 1 will occur more frequently than those in Case 2. Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
