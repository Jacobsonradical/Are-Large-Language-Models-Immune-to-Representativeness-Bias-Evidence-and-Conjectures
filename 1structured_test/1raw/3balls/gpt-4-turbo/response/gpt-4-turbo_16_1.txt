To determine whether there would be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur. The number of different ways we can distribute the balls among A, B, and C such that each child receives a specified number of balls, can be calculated using the concept of multinomial coefficients.

The multinomial coefficient provides the number of ways to deposit \( n \) distinct items into \( k \) distinct groups where the respective groups receive specific numbers of items. It is calculated as:
\[
\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \ldots \times n_k!}
\]
where \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the numbers of items in each of the \( k \) groups and \( n = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k \).

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
Here, all three children receive 2 balls each. The number of ways this can occur is:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
Here, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways this can occur is:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing the two results:
- Case 1 results in \(90\) ways.
- Case 2 results in \(60\) ways.

Since case 1 has more ways the distribution can occur than case 2,
the answer to your question is:
**{case: 1}**
