To solve this, we need to count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case considering the distinguishability of balls:

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
We first choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 balls out of 4 for B, and finally the remaining 2 balls go to C. The number of ways to do this can be calculated as:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
where \(\binom{n}{k}\) denotes a combination and represents the number of ways to choose k objects from n objects without considering the order.
Calculation:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{2} = 6, \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]
\[ \therefore 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \] ways.

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
First choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and finally the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
Calculation:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{3} = 4, \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]
\[ \therefore 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \] ways.

**Comparison:**
Case 1 (90 ways) has more possible outcomes compared to Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

**Answer:** 
{case: 1}
