To determine which case will occur more often, we calculate the number of ways each distribution can happen.

**Case 1** -- A:2, B:2, C:2:
To find the number of ways to split 6 distinguishable balls among A, B, and C such that each child gets exactly 2 balls, we can use the formula for distributing \( n \) distinguishable items into \( k \) groups of sizes \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \):
\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times n_3!}
\]
Here \( n = 6 \), \( n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 2 \). So,
\[
\text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]

**Case 2** -- A:2, B:3, C:1:
Using the same formula for different group sizes:
\[
\text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]

Comparing these two results:
- Case 1 has 90 ways
- Case 2 has 60 ways

Thus, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2 because there are more ways to distribute the balls in the pattern required by Case 1.

Answer:
{case: 1}
