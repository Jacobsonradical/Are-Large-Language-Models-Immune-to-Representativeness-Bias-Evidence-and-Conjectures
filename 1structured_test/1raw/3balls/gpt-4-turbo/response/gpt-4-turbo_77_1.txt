To solve this, we want to calculate the probabilities of both distributions of balls to the children, A, B, and C.

For each child, the balls are distinguishable, and each ball has an equal chance of being given to any of the three children. 

**Computing probabilities for each case:**

1. **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)**:
   - To choose 2 specific balls for each child from the total 6 balls:
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 is: \(\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15\).
   - Then, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls is: \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\).
   - Finally, the number of ways for the remaining 2 balls to go to child C is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\).
   - The total number of ways to achieve this configuration is the product of these, \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

2. **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)**:
   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 is: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).
   - The number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls is: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
   - Finally, the number of ways to choose 1 ball for child C from the remaining one ball is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).
   - The total number of ways to achieve this configuration is \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

**Probability analysis**:
Given that every set of balls is equally probable in distribution, we compare the total ways of distribution:
- Case 1 has 90 possible arrangements.
- Case 2 has 60 possible arrangements.

Comparing the total ways directly, **Case 1** (distribution of 2-2-2) is more likely than **Case 2** (distribution of 2-3-1). Hence, across many rounds of the game, 

**Case 1** (A:2, B:2, C:2) will occur more frequently than **Case 2** (A:2, B:3, C:1).
