To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur and then compare these numbers.

**Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
Each child receives exactly 2 balls.

To compute the number of ways this can occur:
1. Choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to do this.
3. Child C gets the remaining 2 balls, and there is only 1 way to give the last 2 balls to C, so \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\).

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\] ways.

**Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To compute the number of ways this can occur:
1. Choose 2 balls for child A out of the 6. There are \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to do this.
2. Choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4. There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways to do this.
3. Child C will get 1 ball from the remaining, and there are \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to do this.

Thus, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\] ways.

**Comparison:**
Case 1 has 90 ways, while Case 2 has 60 ways.

Thus, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
