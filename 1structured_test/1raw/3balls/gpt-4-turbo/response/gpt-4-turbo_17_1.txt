To solve this, we need to calculate and compare the number of possible ways (combinations) in which each of the cases can occur.

**Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2**
We need to first choose 2 balls for child A from 6 balls, then choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, and finally, the last 2 balls go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is calculated by the combination formula (n choose k) denoted as \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\). 

For A, choose 2 out of 6 = \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).
For B, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 = \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).
The rest go to C, choose 2 out of 2 = \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\).

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1**
Choose 2 balls for A from 6, choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, and 1 ball for C from the remaining 1.

For A, choose 2 out of 6 = \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).
For B, choose 3 out of the remaining 4 = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\).
For C, choose 1 out of the remaining 1 = \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

With these computations, we can see that Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) results in 90 ways, and Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) results in 60 ways.

There will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 since \( 90 > 60 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
