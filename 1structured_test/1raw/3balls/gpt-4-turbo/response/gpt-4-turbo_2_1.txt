To answer the question of which case will arise more often – case 1 where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2, or case 2 where the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1 – we first need to determine the number of unique ways each distribution can occur. We assume each ball is distinguishable, and thus permutations of the same ball to different children count as distinct distributions.

**Finding number of distributions for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
1. Determine how to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. With 4 balls remaining, choose 2 balls for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways.
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) = 1 way.

The total distinct distributions for case 1 are \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}\).
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{2} = 6, and \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]
So, total distinct arrangements = \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Finding number of distributions for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways.
2. From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 for child B. This can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways.
3. The last remaining ball goes to child C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) = 1 way.

The total distinct distributions for case 2 are \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}\).
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{3} = 4, and \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]
So, total distinct arrangements = \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Comparing both:
- Case 1 results in 90 possible distributions.
- Case 2 results in 60 possible distributions.

Therefore, referring to your specified format for the answer:
{case: 1}
