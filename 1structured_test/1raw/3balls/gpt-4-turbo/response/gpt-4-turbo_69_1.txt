To determine which case will result in more outcomes, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case. We can consider each ball as distinct, and each child can receive a specific number of balls according to the case conditions.

**Case 1** — A:2, B:2, C:2:
There are 6 distinguishable balls. We need to decide which 2 of them go to A, then which 2 out of the remaining 4 go to B, and finally, the last 2 must go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for A is computed using combinations, denoted as \( \binom{6}{2} \). Once A has received 2 balls, 4 balls remain. The number of ways to choose 2 from these 4 for B is \( \binom{4}{2} \). Finally, all remaining 2 balls will go to C, and there's only 1 way to choose 2 balls out of 2, which is \( \binom{2}{2} \).

The total number of outcomes for case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2** — A:2, B:3, C:1:
First, choose 2 balls to go to A out of 6, which is \( \binom{6}{2} \). Then, 4 balls remain, and we choose 3 to go to B, which is \( \binom{4}{3} \). Finally, the only remaining ball must go to C, which is \( \binom{1}{1} \).

The total number of outcomes for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the results:
- **Case 1** has 90 ways.
- **Case 2** has 60 ways.

Clearly, there are more possible outcomes in **Case 1** where the distribution is \(A:2, B:2, C:2\) than in **Case 2**. Thus, the answer to the question is:

{case: 1}
