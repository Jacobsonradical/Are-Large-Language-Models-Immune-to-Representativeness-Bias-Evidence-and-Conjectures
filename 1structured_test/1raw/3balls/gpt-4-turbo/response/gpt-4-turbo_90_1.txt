To answer this question, we need to calculate the total number of ways each case can occur. Since each ball is distinguishable and can be given to any of the three children, each ball has 3 choices of children to go to.

**Total possible distributions:**
Each of the 6 distinguishable balls can go to any one of the 3 children, so there is a total of \(3^6\) possible distributions.

**Calculating for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
In this case, each child gets exactly 2 balls. We first choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls to give to child B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this is calculated as follows:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]
Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient and represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) items from \(n\) items without regard to the order. Calculating:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{2} = 6, \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]
So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls according to case 1.

**Calculating for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. We first choose 2 out of the 6 balls for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball automatically goes to child C. 
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15, \binom{4}{3} = 4, \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]
So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls according to case 2.

**Conclusion:**
Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**
{case: 1}
