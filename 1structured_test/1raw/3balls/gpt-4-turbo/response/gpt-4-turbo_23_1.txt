To determine whether case 1 or case 2 will occur more frequently, we will calculate the probability of each case occurring during a single round of the game. These cases deal with the distribution of 6 distinguishable balls among three children A, B, and C. The distribution is not uniform since each child can get any number of balls between 0 and 6, keeping the total always 6.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**
- Each child gets exactly two balls. We need to calculate the number of ways in which 6 distinguishable balls can be assigned such that each child receives exactly 2 balls.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for the first child (A) is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k}$, which results in $\binom{6}{2}$. After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for the second child (B) is $\binom{4}{2}$.
- The remaining 2 balls must go to the third child (C), and there is exactly 1 way to do this: $\binom{2}{2} = 1$.
- Multiplying these together gives the number of arrangements for case 1:
  \[
  \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90.
  \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**
- Child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for A is $\binom{6}{2}$.
- After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls from these 4 for child B is $\binom{4}{3}$.
- The remaining 1 ball goes to child C, and the number of ways to do this is $\binom{1}{1} = 1$.
- Multiplying these gives the number of arrangements for case 2:
  \[
  \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60.
  \]

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur and only 60 ways for case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently.
