To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways that each case can occur and compare them. We want to determine which case will have more results over many rounds of the game.

**Case 1**: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.

**Case 2**: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To find the number of different distributions for each case, we use the formula for distributing distinguishable objects into distinguishable groups, which is given by multinomials. For any distribution a, b, c where a+b+c equals the total number of balls (=6 in our case), the formula is:

\[
\binom{n}{a, b, c} = \frac{n!}{a! \times b! \times c!}
\]

where \( n! \) is the factorial of the total number of balls, and \( a! \), \( b! \), and \( c! \) are the factorials of the number of balls each child receives.

### Calculate for Case 1:
For A, B, and C each getting 2 balls, we have:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 2! \times 2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90
\]
So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls as per Case 1.

### Calculate for Case 2:
For A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball, we have:
\[
\binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60
\]
So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls as per Case 2.

### Conclusion:
Since \( 90 > 60 \), Case 1 produces more possible results than Case 2 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:
   
{case: 1}
