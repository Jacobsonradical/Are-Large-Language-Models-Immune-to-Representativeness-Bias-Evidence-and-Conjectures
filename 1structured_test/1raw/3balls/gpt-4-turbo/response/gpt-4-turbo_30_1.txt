To determine which case will have more results when 6 distinguishable balls are distributed among three children, we need to calculate how many ways each specific distribution (case 1 and case 2) can occur. Each allocation pattern represents a different partition of the 6 balls where order is important due to the distinguishability of the balls.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

Here, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to pick 2 balls out of 6 for the first child (say A) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and we need to pick 2 balls for the second child (say B). This can be done in \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways. Finally, the last 2 balls go to child C automatically, which has exactly \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to occur. Hence, the total number of ways for case 1 can be calculated as:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

Here, child A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to assign 2 balls from 6 to child A is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After that, there are 4 balls left, and choosing 3 balls for child B can be done in \(\binom{4}{3}\) ways, and finally, the last ball goes to child C, which has \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\) way to occur. Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

**Conclusion:**

Since 90 (case 1) is greater than 60 (case 2), there will be more rounds resulting in case 1 where each child receives exactly 2 balls. Thus, the answer is:
{case: 1}
