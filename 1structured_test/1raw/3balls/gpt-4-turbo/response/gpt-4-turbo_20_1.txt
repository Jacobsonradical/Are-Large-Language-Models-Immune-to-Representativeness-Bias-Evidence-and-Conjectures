To find whether case 1 or case 2 occurs more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

**Case 1 -- A:2, B:2, C:2:**
For this case, we must choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then choose 2 of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\). The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{2}\). There are \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) way to give the remaining balls to C.

Total ways for case 1 = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2}\).
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15,
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6,
\binom{2}{2} = 1.
\]
Total ways for case 1 = \(15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90\).

**Case 2 -- A:2, B:3, C:1:**
Here, we have to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.

Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\). Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\). Number of remaining ways to give the last ball to C is \(\binom{1}{1} = 1\).

Total ways for case 2 = \(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1}\).
\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15,
\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4,
\binom{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Total ways for case 2 = \(15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60\).

Now comparing the results, we have 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2. Therefore, case 1 (where each child receives exactly 2 balls) will occur more often. Thus, the answer is:

{case: 1}
