To determine the frequency of the two cases, we first calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur. We then compare these numbers to determine which case is more likely.

**Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, C gets 2 balls**
- We first choose 2 balls for A out of 6, which can be done in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- We then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4, which can be done in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways.
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, which can only be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) = 1 way.

Total number of ways to achieve Case 1:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, C gets 1 ball**
- Choose 2 balls for A out of 6, \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways.
- Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4, \( \binom{4}{3} \) ways.
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C, \( \binom{1}{1} \) = 1 way.

Total number of ways to achieve Case 2:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} \cdot \binom{1}{1} = 15 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 60 \]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 can occur in 90 ways.
- Case 2 can occur in 60 ways.

Since 90 (Case 1) is larger than 60 (Case 2), Case 1 is more likely to occur. Thus, in many rounds of the game, you would expect more outcomes to follow the pattern in Case 1.

Therefore the answer is:
{case: 1}
