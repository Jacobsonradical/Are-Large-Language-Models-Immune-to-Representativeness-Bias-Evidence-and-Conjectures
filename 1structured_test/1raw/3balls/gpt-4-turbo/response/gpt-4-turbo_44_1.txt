To answer the query, let's compute how many ways there are to distribute the balls for each of the two cases.

For general calculation, when distributing \( n \) distinguishable items into groups of sizes \( g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_k \), where \( \sum g_i = n \), the number of such distributions is given by
\[ \frac{n!}{g_1! g_2! \ldots g_k!} \]

**Case 1 -- A:2, B:2, C:2:**
Distributing 6 distinguishable balls so that each child receives exactly 2 balls, the formula becomes:
\[ \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]
Thus, there are 90 possible ways to distribute the balls for this case.

**Case 2 -- A:2, B:3, C:1:**
Distributing 6 distinguishable balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball, the calculation is:
\[ \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]
Thus, there are 60 possible ways to distribute the balls for this case.

Comparing the two results, there are more possible distributions of the balls in **Case 1** where each child gets exactly 2 balls as compared to **Case 2** where the distribution is uneven. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
