To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

However, we need to consider that any of the three children could be the one receiving 3 balls, the one receiving 2 balls, or the one receiving 1 ball. Therefore, we need to multiply this result by the number of permutations of the children, which is \(3!\):

\[ 3! \cdot 60 = 6 \cdot 60 = 360 \]

So, there are 360 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2.

### Conclusion

Since there are 90 ways for Case 1 and 360 ways for Case 2, Case 2 will occur more frequently.

\[ \{\text{case: 2}\} \]
