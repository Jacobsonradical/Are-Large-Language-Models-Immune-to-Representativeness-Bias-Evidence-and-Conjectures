To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, and there is only 1 way to do this:
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating the binomial coefficients:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C, and there is only 1 way to do this:
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating the binomial coefficients:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.

\[ \boxed{\text{case: 1}} \]
