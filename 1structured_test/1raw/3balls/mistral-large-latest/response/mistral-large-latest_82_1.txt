To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we need to distribute the balls such that one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

However, since the balls are distinguishable and the children are distinguishable, we also need to consider the different permutations of the children receiving the balls. There are 3! (or 6) ways to assign which child gets 2 balls, which gets 3 balls, and which gets 1 ball.

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 360 ways

Therefore, Case 2 will occur more frequently.

\[ \text{{case: 2}} \]
