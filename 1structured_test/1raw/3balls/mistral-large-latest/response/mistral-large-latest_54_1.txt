To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 is \( \binom{4}{2} \).

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, which can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating these values:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} \).

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C, which can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating these values:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
