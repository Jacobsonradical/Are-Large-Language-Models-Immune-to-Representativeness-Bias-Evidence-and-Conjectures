To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! = 2 \]
\[ 2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2! = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8 \]

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is also given by the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ 6! = 720 \]
\[ 2! = 2 \]
\[ 3! = 6 \]
\[ 1! = 1 \]

\[ 2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1! = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 12 \]

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two results:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently.
