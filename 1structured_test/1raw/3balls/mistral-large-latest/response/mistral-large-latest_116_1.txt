To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

**Conclusion:**

Since 90 (Case 1) is greater than 60 (Case 2), Case 1 will occur more frequently.

\[ \{\text{case: 1}\} \]
