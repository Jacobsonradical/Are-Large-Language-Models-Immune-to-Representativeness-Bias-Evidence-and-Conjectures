To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is also calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

### Conclusion

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, case 1 will occur more frequently.

\[ \text{{case: 1}} \]
