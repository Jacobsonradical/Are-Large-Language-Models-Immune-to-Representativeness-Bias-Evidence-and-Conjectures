To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in this manner.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is given by the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in this manner.

### Conclusion
Since there are 90 ways for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

\[ \text{{case: 1}} \]
