To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls can be calculated using combinations.

First, choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Next, choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, and there is only 1 way to do this:
\[ \binom{2}{2} = 1 \]

The total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball.

First, choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Next, choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C, and there is only 1 way to do this:
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

The total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Comparison

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

### Answer

\[ \text{{case: 1}} \]
