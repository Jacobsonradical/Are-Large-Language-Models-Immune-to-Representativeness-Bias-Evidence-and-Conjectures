To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 will automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2! \times 4!} \times \frac{4!}{2! \times 2!} \times \frac{2!}{2! \times 0!} \]

\[ = 15 \times 6 \times 1 \]

\[ = 90 \]

However, since the children are distinguishable but the groups of 2 balls are not, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the three groups of 2 balls, which is \(3!\):

\[ \frac{90}{3!} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 1 will automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

\[ = \frac{6!}{2! \times 4!} \times \frac{4!}{3! \times 1!} \times \frac{1!}{1! \times 0!} \]

\[ = 15 \times 4 \times 1 \]

\[ = 60 \]

Since the children are distinguishable but the groups of balls are not, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the three groups (2, 3, and 1 balls), which is \(3!\):

\[ \frac{60}{3!} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

However, we must consider that there are 3 different ways to assign the distributions (A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, C:3, B:1), and (B:2, A:3, C:1), etc. So we multiply by 3:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 15 ways
- Case 2: 30 ways

Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently.

**Answer:**

\[ \{\text{case: 2}\} \]
