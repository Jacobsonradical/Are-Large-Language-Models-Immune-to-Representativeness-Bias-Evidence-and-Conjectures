To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is \( \binom{4}{2} \).

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C, which can be done in \( \binom{2}{2} \) ways.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is \( \binom{6}{2} \).

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C, which can be done in \( \binom{1}{1} \) ways.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times \frac{1!}{1!0!} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

**Answer:**
\[
\{case: 1\}
\]
