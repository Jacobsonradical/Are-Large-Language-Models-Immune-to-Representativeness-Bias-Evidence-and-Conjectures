To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 can be calculated using combinations.

First, we choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B from the remaining 4, and finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

Multiplying these together:

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

However, since the balls are distinguishable but the children are not (in terms of the distribution), we need to divide by the number of permutations of the children, which is \( 3! = 6 \).

So, the number of ways for Case 1 is:

\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

Multiplying these together:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

Since the children are distinguishable in terms of the distribution, we do not need to divide by any permutations.

So, the number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two results:

- Case 1: 15 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, Case 2 will occur more frequently.

\[ \text{{case: 2}} \]
