To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using combinations.

The total number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, 4 balls remain. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{2}\). Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C, which can be done in \(\binom{2}{2}\) ways.

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated as follows:

The total number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is \(\binom{6}{2}\). After choosing 2 balls for A, 4 balls remain. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is \(\binom{4}{3}\). Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C, which can be done in \(\binom{1}{1}\) ways.

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times \frac{1!}{1!0!} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two results:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

\{case: 1\}
