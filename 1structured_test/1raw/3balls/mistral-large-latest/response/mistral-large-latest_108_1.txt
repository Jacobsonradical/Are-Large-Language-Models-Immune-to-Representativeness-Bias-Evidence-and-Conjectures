To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations.

1. Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

1. Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 15 \times 4 = 60
\]

### Comparison

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

### Answer

\[
\{\text{case}: 1\}
\]
