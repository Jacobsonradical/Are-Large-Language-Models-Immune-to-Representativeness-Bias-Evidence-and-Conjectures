To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

Here, each child receives 2 balls. We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(2 \times 1) \times (2 \times 1) \times (2 \times 1)} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Here, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls in this manner.

This can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(2 \times 1) \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) \times 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2.

### Conclusion

Comparing the two results:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

\[ \{\text{case: 1}\} \]
