To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 automatically go to C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 1 automatically goes to C. The number of ways to do this is given by:

\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating each term:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

However, we must also consider the different permutations of the children receiving the balls. For Case 2, there are 3 different ways to assign the distributions (A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, C:3, B:1), and (B:2, A:3, C:1), etc. This means we need to multiply the number of ways by 3! (since there are 3 children and we are distributing the roles of who gets 2, who gets 3, and who gets 1):

\[ 60 \times 3! = 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 360 ways

Therefore, Case 2 will occur more frequently.

\[ \text{{case: 2}} \]
