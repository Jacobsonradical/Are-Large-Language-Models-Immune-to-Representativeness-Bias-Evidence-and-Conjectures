To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 2, 2} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is also given by the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \binom{6}{2, 3, 1} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2.

**Comparison:**

- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.

**Answer:**

\[ \{\text{case: 1}\} \]
