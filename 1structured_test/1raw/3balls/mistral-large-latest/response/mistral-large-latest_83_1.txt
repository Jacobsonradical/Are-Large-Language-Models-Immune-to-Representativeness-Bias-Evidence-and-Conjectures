To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{720}{8} = 90 \]

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of ways} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} \]

Calculating this:

\[ \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 3! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{2 \cdot 6 \cdot 1} = \frac{720}{12} = 60 \]

However, we need to consider that any of the children A, B, or C could be the one receiving 1, 2, or 3 balls. There are 3! (6) ways to permute the roles of A, B, and C.

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two cases:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 360 ways

Clearly, Case 2 will occur more frequently.
