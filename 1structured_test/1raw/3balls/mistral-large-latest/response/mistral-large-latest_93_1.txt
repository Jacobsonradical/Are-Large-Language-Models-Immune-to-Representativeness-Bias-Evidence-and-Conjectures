To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls can be calculated using combinations.

First, choose 2 balls for child A out of 6:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Then, choose 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C:
\[ \binom{2}{2} \]

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.

First, choose 2 balls for child A out of 6:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Then, choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C:
\[ \binom{1}{1} \]

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = \frac{1!}{1!0!} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
