To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child receives 2 balls. We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the combination formula:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C, so there is only 1 way to choose these balls.

Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 1 \]

Calculating these combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to C, so there is only 1 way to choose this ball.

Therefore, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times 1 \]

Calculating these combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two cases:
- Case 1 has 90 ways.
- Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.
