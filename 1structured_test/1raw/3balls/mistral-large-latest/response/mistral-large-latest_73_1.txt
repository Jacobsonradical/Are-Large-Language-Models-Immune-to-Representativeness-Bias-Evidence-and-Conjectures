To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

For this case, we need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations.

First, we choose 2 balls for A out of 6:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Then, we choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{2} \]

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C:
\[ \binom{2}{2} \]

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} \]

Calculating these combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 1 is:
\[ 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90 \]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

For this case, we need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

First, we choose 2 balls for A out of 6:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \]

Then, we choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} \]

Finally, the remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C:
\[ \binom{1}{1} \]

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} \]

Calculating these combinations:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]
\[ \binom{1}{1} = 1 \]

So, the total number of ways for Case 2 is:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60 \]

### Conclusion

Comparing the two results:
- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1.
