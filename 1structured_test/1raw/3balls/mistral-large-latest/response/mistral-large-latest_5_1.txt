To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

### Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations:

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{2}\)
3. Choose 2 balls for C out of the remaining 2: \(\binom{2}{2}\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{2!2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 15 \times 6 \times 1 = 90
\]

### Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

We need to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this can be calculated as follows:

1. Choose 2 balls for A out of 6: \(\binom{6}{2}\)
2. Choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\)
3. Choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1: \(\binom{1}{1}\)

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is:
\[
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{1}{1} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \times \frac{4!}{3!1!} \times \frac{1!}{1!0!} = 15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60
\]

### Comparison

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since 90 is greater than 60, Case 1 will occur more frequently.

### Answer

\[
\text{{case: 1}}
\]
