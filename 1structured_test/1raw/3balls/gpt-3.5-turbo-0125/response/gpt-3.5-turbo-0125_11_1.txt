To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are 6 balls total, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C. This can be calculated using combinations:
6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 2 for B = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Again, there are 6 balls total. We need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C:
6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 3 for B = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
