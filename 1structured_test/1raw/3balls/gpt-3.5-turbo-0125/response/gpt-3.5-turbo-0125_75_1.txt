To answer this question, we need to consider the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and 2 balls for child C.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
