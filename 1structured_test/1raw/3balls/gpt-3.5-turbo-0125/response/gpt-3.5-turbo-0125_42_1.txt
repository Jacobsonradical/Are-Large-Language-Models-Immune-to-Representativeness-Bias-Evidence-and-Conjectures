To determine which case will have more results, we can use combinatorial reasoning.

In case 1, there are 6 balls and we need to distribute them as 2 to each child. We can think of this as choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the remaining 2 for child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90.

In case 2, we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 3 balls to child B, and 1 ball to child C. This is similar to case 1, but with different numbers of balls for each child. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
