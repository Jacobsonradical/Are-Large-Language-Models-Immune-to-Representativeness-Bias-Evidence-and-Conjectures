To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, let's analyze the possibilities for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6 balls in total and we need to distribute them so that each child gets 2 balls.
- This can be calculated as C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 possibilities.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, we need to distribute the 6 balls so that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.
- This can be calculated as C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 possibilities.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 possibilities) than case 2 (60 possibilities) in many rounds of the game.
