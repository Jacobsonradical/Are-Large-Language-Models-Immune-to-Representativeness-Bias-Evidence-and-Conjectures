To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C.
This can be calculated using the combinations formula: C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2:
Similarly, there are 6 balls, but now we need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C.
This can be calculated using the combinations formula: C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
