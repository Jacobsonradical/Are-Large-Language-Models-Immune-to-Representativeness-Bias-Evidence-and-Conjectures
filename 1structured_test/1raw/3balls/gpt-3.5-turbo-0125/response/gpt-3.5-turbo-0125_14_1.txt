To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6 balls and the task is to divide them into groups of 2 for each child. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then choosing 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, with the last 2 going to child C.
- This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6 balls and the task is to divide them into groups of 2, 3, and 1 for each child. This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there are more results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways).
