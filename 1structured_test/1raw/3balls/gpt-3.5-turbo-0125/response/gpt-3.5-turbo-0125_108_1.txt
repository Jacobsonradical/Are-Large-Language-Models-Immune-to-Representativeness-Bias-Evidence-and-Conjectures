To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6 balls and we want to distribute them among the 3 children in the ratio 2:2:2.
The number of ways this can be done is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways this case can occur is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
