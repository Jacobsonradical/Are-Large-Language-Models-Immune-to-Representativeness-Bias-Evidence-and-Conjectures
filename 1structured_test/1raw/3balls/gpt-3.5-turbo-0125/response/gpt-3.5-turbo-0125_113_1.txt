To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur. 

Case 1:
In case 1, each child needs to receive 2 balls. There are a total of 6 balls, so we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:
6! / (2!2!2!) = 90

Case 2:
In case 2, child A needs 2 balls, child B needs 3 balls, and child C needs 1 ball. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:
6! / (2!3!1!) = 60

Therefore, based on the calculations, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
{case: 1}
