To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are 6 balls in total and we need to distribute them in groups of 2 to each of the 3 children. This can be calculated using combinations:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2:
Similarly, for Case 2:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1:
{case: 1}
