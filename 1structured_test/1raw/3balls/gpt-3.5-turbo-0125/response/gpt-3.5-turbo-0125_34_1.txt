To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4C2 = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls go to child C
Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4C3 = 4 ways
- The remaining ball goes to child C
Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
