To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are total 6 balls and 6 ways to choose the first ball, 5 ways to choose the second ball, and so on.
Thus, the total number of ways for case 1 = 6! / (2!2!2!) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, the total number of ways for case 2 = 6! / (2!3!1!) = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
