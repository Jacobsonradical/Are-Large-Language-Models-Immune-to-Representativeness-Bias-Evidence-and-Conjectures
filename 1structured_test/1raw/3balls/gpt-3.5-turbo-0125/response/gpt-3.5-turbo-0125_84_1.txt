To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
There are 6 balls total, and we need to distribute them among three children such that each child gets 2 balls. This can be done in 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

For case 2:
Again, there are 6 total balls, and we need to distribute them such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
