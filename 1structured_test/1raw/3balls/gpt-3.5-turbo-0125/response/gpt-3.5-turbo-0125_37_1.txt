To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6 balls in total, and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A is given by C(6,2) = 15.
- After A has received their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left for B to choose 2 from, giving C(4,2) = 6 ways.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 to occur is 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6 balls in total, and we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A is C(6,2) = 15.
- After A has received their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left for B to choose 3 from, giving C(4,3) = 4 ways.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 to occur is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
