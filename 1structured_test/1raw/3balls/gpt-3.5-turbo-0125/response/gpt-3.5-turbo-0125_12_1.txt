To compute the number of results for each case, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula.

Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2:
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with each receiving 2 balls is:
6!/(2!2!2!) = 90

Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1:
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with A receiving 2 balls, B receiving 3 balls, and C receiving 1 ball is:
6!/(2!3!1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more results for case 1 (90) than for case 2 (60).
