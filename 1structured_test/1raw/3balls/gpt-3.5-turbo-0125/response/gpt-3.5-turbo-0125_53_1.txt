To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to distribute 2 balls to each child. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula, which is (6!)/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 90.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 3 balls to child B, and 1 ball to child C. This can be calculated in a similar way, (6!)/(2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Therefore, case 1 will occur more often than case 2.
