To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can use combinatorial reasoning.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we can choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A in ${6 \choose 2}$ ways. Then, we can choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B in ${4 \choose 2}$ ways. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} = 15 \times 6 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we can choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A in ${6 \choose 2}$ ways. Then, we can choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B in ${4 \choose 3}$ ways. The remaining ball will automatically go to child C. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3} = 15 \times 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
