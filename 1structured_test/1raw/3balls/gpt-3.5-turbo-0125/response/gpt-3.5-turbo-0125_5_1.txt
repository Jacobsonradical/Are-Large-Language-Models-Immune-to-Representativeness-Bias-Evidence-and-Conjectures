To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 for C. This can be calculated using combinations: 
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last one for C. This can be calculated using combinations: 
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
