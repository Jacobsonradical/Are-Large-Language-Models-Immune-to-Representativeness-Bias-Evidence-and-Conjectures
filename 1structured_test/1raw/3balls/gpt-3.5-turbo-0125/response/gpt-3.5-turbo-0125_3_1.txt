To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 balls and we need to distribute them into 3 groups of 2 each.
- The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is calculated by 6! / (2!)^3 = 90 ways.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6 balls and we need to distribute them into groups of 2, 3, and 1.
- The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is calculated by 6! / (2!*3!*1!) = 60 ways.

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, we see that there are more results for Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
