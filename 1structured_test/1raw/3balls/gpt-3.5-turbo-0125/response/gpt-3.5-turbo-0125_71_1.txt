To determine which case will have more results, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, C gets 2 balls
There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will automatically go to C.
The number of ways this can happen is given by the multinomial coefficient:
6! / (2!2!2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, C gets 1 ball
Similarly, we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and the remaining ball goes to C.
The number of ways this can happen is:
6! / (2!3!1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
