To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. To calculate the number of ways for this specific case, we need to choose 2 balls for child A, then choose 2 from the remaining 4 for child B, leaving the remaining 2 for child C. This can be calculated as:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for this case, we need to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C. This can be calculated as:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).
