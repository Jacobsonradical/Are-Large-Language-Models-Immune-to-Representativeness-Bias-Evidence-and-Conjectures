To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur. 

In case 1, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls, the total number of ways this can happen is calculated as follows:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: 4C2 = 6 ways
- The rest of the 2 balls go to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

In case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the total number of ways this can happen is calculated as follows:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: 4C3 = 4 ways
- The rest of the 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways, we see that case 1 occurs more frequently (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
