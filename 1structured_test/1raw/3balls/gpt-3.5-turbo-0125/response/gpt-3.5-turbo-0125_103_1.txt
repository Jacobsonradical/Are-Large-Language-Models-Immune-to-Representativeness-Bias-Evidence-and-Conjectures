To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- Choose 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: C(4, 2) = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls go to C
- Total number of ways = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 out of 6 balls for A: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- Choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B: C(4, 3) = 4 ways
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C
- Total number of ways = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.
