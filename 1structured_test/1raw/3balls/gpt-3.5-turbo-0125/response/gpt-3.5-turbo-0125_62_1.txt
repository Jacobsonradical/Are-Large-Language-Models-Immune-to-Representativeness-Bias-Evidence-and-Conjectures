To determine which case occurs more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.
- Since the balls are distinguishable, there are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways for case 1 to occur. (Dividing by 2!2!2! to account for the identical balls within each child)

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.
- Similarly, there are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.
