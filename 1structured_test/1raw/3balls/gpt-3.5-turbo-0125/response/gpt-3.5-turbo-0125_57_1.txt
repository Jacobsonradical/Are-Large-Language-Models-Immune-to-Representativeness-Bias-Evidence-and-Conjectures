In order to determine which case occurs more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula: 
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
This can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula: 
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, case 1 occurs more often than case 2 in the game.
