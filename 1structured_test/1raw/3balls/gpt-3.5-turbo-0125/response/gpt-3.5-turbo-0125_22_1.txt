To determine which case, 1 or 2, will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
