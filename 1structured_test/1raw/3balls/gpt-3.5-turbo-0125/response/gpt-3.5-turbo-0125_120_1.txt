To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to distribute them among the 3 children.
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, using the multinomial coefficient formula:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
