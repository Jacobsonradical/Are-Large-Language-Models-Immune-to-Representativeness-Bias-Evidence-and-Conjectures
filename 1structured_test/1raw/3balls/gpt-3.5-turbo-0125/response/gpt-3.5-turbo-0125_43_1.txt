To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are 6 balls to distribute among the 3 children, with each child receiving 2 balls. We can calculate this using combinations:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2:
Similarly, there are 6 balls to distribute among the 3 children, with A receiving 2 balls, B receiving 3 balls, and C receiving 1 ball:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
