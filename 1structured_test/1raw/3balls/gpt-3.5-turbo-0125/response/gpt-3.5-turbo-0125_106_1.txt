To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can use combinatorial analysis.

In case 1, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2, we can consider the number of ways to distribute the balls among the children. There are a total of 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to arrange the 6 balls among the children such that each child gets 2 balls.

In case 2, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1, there are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the balls among the children in this scenario.

Therefore, there are more possible results for case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
