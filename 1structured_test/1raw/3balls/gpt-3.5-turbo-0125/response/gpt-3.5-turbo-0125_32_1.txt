To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
- There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.
- After A has chosen 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining for B, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$.
- The remaining 2 balls are automatically given to C.
- Therefore, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is $15 \times 6 = 90$.

For case 2:
- There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.
- After A has chosen 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining for B, so the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is ${4 \choose 3} = 4$.
- The remaining 1 ball is automatically given to C.
- Therefore, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is $15 \times 4 = 60$.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
