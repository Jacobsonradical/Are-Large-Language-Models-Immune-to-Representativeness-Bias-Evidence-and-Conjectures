To determine which case will have more results, we can use the concept of combinations. 

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is 6 choose 2 = 15.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4 for B is 4 choose 2 = 6.
- The remaining 2 balls will go to C automatically.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is 6 choose 2 = 15.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 4 for B is 4 choose 3 = 4.
- The remaining ball will go to C automatically.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two totals, we see that there are more possible results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways).
