To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of possible ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In case 1, there are 6 balls distributed as 2 each to A, B, and C. The total number of ways this can occur is calculated as:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2:
In case 2, there are 6 balls distributed as 2 to A, 3 to B, and 1 to C. The total number of ways this can occur is calculated as:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

{case: 1}
