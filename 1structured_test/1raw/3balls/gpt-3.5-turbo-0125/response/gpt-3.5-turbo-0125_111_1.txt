To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinations.

In case 1, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with each child receiving 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated using the formula for combinations: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

In case 2, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with one child receiving 3 balls and the other two receiving 2 balls each. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated as: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

Therefore, both cases will have an equal number of results in many rounds of the game.
