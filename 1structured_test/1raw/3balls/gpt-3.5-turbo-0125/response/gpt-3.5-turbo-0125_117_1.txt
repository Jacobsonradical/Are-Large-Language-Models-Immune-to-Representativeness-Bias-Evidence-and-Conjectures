To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 where A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls, the number of ways this can happen is calculated by finding the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 balls for C. This can be calculated using combinations:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

In case 2 where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the number of ways this can happen is calculated similarly:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
