To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:2, C:2, we can calculate the number of ways this can happen by considering the number of ways we can choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest 2 for C. This can be calculated using combinations:

${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways

In case 2, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1, we can similarly calculate the number of ways by choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last one for C:

${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
