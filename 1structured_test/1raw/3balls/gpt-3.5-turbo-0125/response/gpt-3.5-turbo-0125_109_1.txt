To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are a total of 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
There are a total of 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
