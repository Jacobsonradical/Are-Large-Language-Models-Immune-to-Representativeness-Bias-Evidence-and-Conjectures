To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 distinguishable balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is 6 choose 2 = 15.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for B out of these 4, which is 4 choose 2 = 6.
- Once A and B have taken their balls, the remaining 2 balls go to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6 choose 2 ways for A to get their 2 balls.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 3 for B out of these 4, which is 4 choose 3 = 4.
- Once A and B have taken their balls, the remaining ball goes to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of 6 * 4 = 24 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (24 ways).
