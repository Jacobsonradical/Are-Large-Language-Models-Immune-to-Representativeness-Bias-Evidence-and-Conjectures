To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children when each child receives 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
In this case, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children in this scenario is: 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game compared to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
