To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are a total of 6 choose 2 ways to choose which 2 balls A gets, then 4 choose 2 ways to choose which 2 balls B gets. The last 2 balls automatically go to C. So the total number of ways for case 1 is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, there are a total of 6 choose 2 ways to choose which 2 balls A gets, then 4 choose 3 ways to choose which 3 balls B gets. The last ball goes to C. So the total number of ways for case 2 is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
