In order to determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 2 balls to each child, we can calculate this as selecting 2 out of 6 balls for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, leaving the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways = ${6 \choose 2} * {4 \choose 2} = 15 * 6 = 90$

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C, we can calculate this as selecting 2 out of 6 balls for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for B, leaving the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways = ${6 \choose 2} * {4 \choose 3} = 15 * 4 = 60$

Comparing the number of ways, we see that Case 1 has more possible results than Case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
{case: 1}
