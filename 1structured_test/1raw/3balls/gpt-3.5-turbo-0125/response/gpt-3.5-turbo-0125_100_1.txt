To determine which case is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1:
In order for A to receive 2 balls, we must choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. This can be done in C(6, 2) = 15 ways.
Once A has received their 2 balls, the remaining 4 balls can be distributed to B and C in C(4, 2) = 6 ways.
So, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

Case 2:
In order for A to receive 2 balls, we must choose 2 out of the 6 balls to give to A. This can be done in C(6, 2) = 15 ways.
Once A has received their 2 balls, the remaining 4 balls can be distributed to B and C in C(4, 3) = 4 ways.
So, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
