To determine which case will have more results, we need to calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we need to distribute 2 balls to each of the 3 children. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient formula: 

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, in this case, we need to distribute 2 balls to one child, 3 balls to another child, and 1 ball to the last child. The number of ways to do this is also given by the multinomial coefficient formula:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
