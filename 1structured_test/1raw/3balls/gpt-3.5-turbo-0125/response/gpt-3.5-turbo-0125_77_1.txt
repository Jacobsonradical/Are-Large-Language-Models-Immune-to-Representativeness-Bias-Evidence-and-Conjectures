To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 will go to C. 
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:
Total ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, there are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
Total ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
