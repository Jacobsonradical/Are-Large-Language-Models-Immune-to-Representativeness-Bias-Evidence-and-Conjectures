To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6!/2!2!2! = 90 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children where each child receives 2 balls.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 6!/2!3!1! = 60 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.

Therefore, case 1 occurs more frequently than case 2.
