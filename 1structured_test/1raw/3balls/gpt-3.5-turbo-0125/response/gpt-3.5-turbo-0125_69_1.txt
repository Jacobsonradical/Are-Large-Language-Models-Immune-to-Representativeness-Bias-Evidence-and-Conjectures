To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

1. Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.
This can be calculated as (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

2. Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Similarly, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.
This can be calculated as (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
