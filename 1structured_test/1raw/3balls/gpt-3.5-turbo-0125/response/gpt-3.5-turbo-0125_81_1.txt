To answer this question, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6 balls and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be calculated as:
${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are 6 balls and we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be calculated as:
${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
