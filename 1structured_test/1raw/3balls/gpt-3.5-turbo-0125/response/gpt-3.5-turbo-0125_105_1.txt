To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In case 1, where A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls, the number of ways this distribution can occur can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2:
In case 2, where A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball, the number of ways this distribution can occur can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more ways for case 1 (90) to occur compared to case 2 (60).
