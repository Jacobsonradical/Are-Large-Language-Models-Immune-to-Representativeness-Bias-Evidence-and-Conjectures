To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

In case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
