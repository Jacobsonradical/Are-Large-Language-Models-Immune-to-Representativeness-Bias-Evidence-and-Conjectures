To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the balls among the children.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the balls among the children.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), we can conclude that case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
