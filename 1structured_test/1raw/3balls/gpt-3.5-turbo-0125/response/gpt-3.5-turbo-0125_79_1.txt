To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the 6 balls evenly among the 3 children.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
There are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the 6 balls according to this distribution.

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
