To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to distribute 2 balls to each of the 3 children. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2,2,2):
(6 choose 2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2,3,1):
(6 choose 2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
