To determine which case will have more results, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls
This can be calculated using combinations:
Number of ways A can get 2 balls out of 6: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
Number of ways B can get 2 balls out of the remaining 4: 4 choose 2 = 6 ways
Once A and B have their balls, C will automatically get the remaining 2 balls.
Total number of ways for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball
Similarly, using combinations:
Number of ways A can get 2 balls out of 6: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
Number of ways B can get 3 balls out of the remaining 4: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
Once A and B have their balls, C will automatically get the remaining 1 ball.
Total number of ways for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
