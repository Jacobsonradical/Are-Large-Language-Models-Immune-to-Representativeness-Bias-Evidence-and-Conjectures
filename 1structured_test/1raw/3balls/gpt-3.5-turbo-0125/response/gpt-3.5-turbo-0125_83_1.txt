To determine which case will appear more often in a large number of rounds, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In this case, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 each (A, B, C). The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is calculated as:
6! / (2!2!2!) = 90 ways

Case 2:
In this case, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups with 2, 3, and 1 ball respectively (A:2, B:3, C:1). The number of ways to do this is again given by the multinomial coefficient:
6! / (2!3!1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, in a large number of rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 ({case: 1}).
