To determine which case will occur more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are ${6 \choose 2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 balls.
After A is assigned 2 balls, there are ${4 \choose 2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls.
The rest of the balls automatically go to child C.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$ ways.

Case 2:
Similarly, there are ${6 \choose 2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 balls.
Then, there are ${4 \choose 3}$ ways to choose 3 balls for child B out of the remaining 4 balls.
The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.
So, the total number of ways for case 2 is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$ ways.

Therefore, case 1 will occur more frequently in the game.
