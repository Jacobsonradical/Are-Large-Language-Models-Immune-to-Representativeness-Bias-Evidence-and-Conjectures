To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we first choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, leaving the last 2 balls for child C. This can be done in 6!/(2!*2!*2!) = 90 ways.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we first choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, leaving the last ball for child C. This can be done in 6!/(2!*3!*1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
