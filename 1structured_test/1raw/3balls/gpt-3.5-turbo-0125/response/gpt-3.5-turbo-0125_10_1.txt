To determine which case is more likely to occur, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur in a round of the game.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.
- However, within group A, there are 2! ways to arrange the 2 balls among the 2 children in group A.
- Similarly, within group B and group C, there are 2! ways to arrange the balls in each group.
- Therefore, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is: 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.
- However, within group A, there are 2! ways to arrange the 2 balls among the 2 children in group A.
- Similarly, within group B, there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 balls among the 3 children in group B.
- Therefore, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is: 6! / (2! * 3!) = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur, we can see that case 1 is more likely to occur with 90 ways compared to case 2 with 60 ways.
