To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the total possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1:
- The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

For case 2:
- The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 compared to case 2.
