To determine which case occurs more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. However, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to divide by the 2! permutations of the balls within each child's possession.
So, the number of ways for case 1 to occur is: 
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, we calculate the number of ways for case 2 to occur:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 occurring in many rounds of the game.
