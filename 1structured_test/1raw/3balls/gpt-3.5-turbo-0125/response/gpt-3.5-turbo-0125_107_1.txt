To determine which case will happen more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4C2 = 6 ways
- The last 2 balls automatically go to child C
Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6C2 = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4C3 = 4 ways
- The last ball automatically goes to child C
Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
