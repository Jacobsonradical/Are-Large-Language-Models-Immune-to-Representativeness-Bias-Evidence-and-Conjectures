To determine which case will have more results in the game, we can calculate the number of possible ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and the remaining 2 for child C. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which is 6C2 = 15. Once we have chosen 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B, which can be done in 4C2 = 6 ways. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6C2 = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for child A. After that, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 3 for child B, which can be done in 4C3 = 4 ways. The remaining ball automatically goes to child C. Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the number of possible ways:
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 {case: 1}.
