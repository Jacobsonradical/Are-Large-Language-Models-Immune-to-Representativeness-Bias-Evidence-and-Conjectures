To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can use combinations.

For case 1: 
There are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. 
This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2:
There are 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90) than case 2 (60).
