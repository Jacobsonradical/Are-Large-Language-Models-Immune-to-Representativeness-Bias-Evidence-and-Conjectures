To determine which case occurs more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$.
- Once A and B have taken their balls, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of $15 \times 6 = 90$ ways for case 1 to occur.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls for A.
- After A has taken their 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining, so the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is ${4 \choose 3} = 4$.
- Once A and B have taken their balls, the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of $15 \times 4 = 60$ ways for case 2 to occur.

Overall, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
