To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probabilities for each case.

Case 1:
There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. 
For child A to get 2 balls, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A, and then the remaining 4 balls can be distributed among the remaining 2 children in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways. 
So, the total number of ways for case 1 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 90$.

Case 2:
Similarly, for child A to get 2 balls, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A. 
For child B to get 3 balls, there are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. 
So, the total number of ways for case 2 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 80$.

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, we see that there are more results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (80 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
