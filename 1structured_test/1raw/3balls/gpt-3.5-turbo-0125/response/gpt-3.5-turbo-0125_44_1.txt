To determine which case occurs more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6 balls total. We need to choose 2 out of 6 for A, then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the remaining 2 for C. This can be calculated as:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are also 6 balls total. We need to choose 2 out of 6 for A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the remaining 1 for C. This can be calculated as:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, case 1 occurs more often than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
