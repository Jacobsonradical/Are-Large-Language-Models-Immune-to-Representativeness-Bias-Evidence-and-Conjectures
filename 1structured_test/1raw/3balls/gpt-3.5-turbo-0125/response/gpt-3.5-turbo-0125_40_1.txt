In order to determine which case will occur more frequently, we can use basic combinatorial principles.

For case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2:
There are a total of 6 balls and we need to distribute 2 balls to each of the 3 children. We can calculate the number of ways to do this using combinations:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1:
Similarly, there are a total of 6 balls and we need to distribute 2, 3, and 1 ball to each of the children. Calculating the combinations:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, based on the calculations above, case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2 will occur more frequently.
