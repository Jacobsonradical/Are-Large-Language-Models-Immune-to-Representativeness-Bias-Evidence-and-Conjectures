To determine which case will occur more often in the game, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are a total of $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways to distribute 2 balls to child A, 2 balls to child B, and 2 balls to child C.

Case 2:
There are a total of $\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways to distribute 2 balls to child A, 3 balls to child B, and 1 ball to child C.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
