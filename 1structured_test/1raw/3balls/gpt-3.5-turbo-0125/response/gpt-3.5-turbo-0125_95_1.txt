To determine which case is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute 2 balls to each of the 3 children.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute 2 balls to one child, 3 balls to another child, and 1 ball to the third child.

Therefore, there are more possible outcomes for case 1 than for case 2.

{case: 1}
