To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Once A has 2 balls, there are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B
- The remaining 2 balls go to C
- Total number of ways for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

For case 2:
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Once A has 2 balls, there are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C
- Total number of ways for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
