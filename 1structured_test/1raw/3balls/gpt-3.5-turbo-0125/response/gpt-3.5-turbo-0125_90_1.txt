To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are 6! ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the 3 children. Since the balls given to A are indistinguishable from each other (same for B and C), we need to divide by the permutations of the balls within A, B, and C.
Number of ways for case 1 = 6!/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, the number of ways for case 2 can be calculated as:
Number of ways for case 2 = 6!/(2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
