To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for Child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for Child B, leaving the last 2 balls for Child C. This can be calculated as:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for Child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for Child B, leaving the last ball for Child C. This can be calculated as:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 will occur more often than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
