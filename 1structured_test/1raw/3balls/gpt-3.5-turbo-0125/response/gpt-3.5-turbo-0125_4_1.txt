To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the total number of possible ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls in total, and we need to distribute them in groups of 2 to each child. We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient formula:
(6 choose 2,2,2) = 6! / (2!*2!*2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Using the same method as above, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case:
(6 choose 2,3,1) = 6! / (2!*3!*1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more possible results for case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
