To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6: $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways
- Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways
- The remaining 2 balls go to C
- Total number of ways for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6: $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways
- Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C
- Total number of ways for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
