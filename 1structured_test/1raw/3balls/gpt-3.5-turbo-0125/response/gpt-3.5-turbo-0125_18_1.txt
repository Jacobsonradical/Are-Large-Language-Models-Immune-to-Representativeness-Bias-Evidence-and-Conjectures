To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the permutations of each case.

Case 1:
There are 3 balls of each color (2 balls each for 3 colors) distributed among 3 children. The number of ways this can be done is equal to the multinomial coefficient C(6,2,2,2) which is calculated as:
C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2:
There are 3 balls of one color, 2 balls of another color, and 1 ball of the third color distributed among 3 children. The number of ways this can be done is equal to the multinomial coefficient C(6,3,2,1) which is calculated as:
C(6,3,2,1) = 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more results for Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).
