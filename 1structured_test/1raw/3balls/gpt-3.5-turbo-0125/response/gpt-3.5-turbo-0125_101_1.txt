To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A is C(6, 2) = 15.
- Once child A has received 2 balls, there are 4 balls left for child B. The number of ways to choose 2 out of these 4 balls for child B is C(4, 2) = 6.
- Therefore, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A is C(6, 2) = 15.
- Once child A has received 2 balls, there are 4 balls left for child B. The number of ways to choose 3 out of these 4 balls for child B is C(4, 3) = 4.
- Therefore, there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the number of ways for case 1 (90 ways) and case 2 (60 ways), we can see that there will be more results of case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
