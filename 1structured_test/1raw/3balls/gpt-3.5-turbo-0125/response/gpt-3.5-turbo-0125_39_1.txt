To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are a total of 6 balls, and we want to distribute them among 3 children with 2 balls each. We can first choose which 2 balls A receives in 6 choose 2 ways, then choose 2 balls for B in 4 choose 2 ways, and the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
6 choose 2 * 4 choose 2 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2:
Similarly, for case 2, we can first choose which 2 balls A receives in 6 choose 2 ways, then choose 3 balls for B in 4 choose 3 ways, and the remaining ball goes to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
6 choose 2 * 4 choose 3 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
