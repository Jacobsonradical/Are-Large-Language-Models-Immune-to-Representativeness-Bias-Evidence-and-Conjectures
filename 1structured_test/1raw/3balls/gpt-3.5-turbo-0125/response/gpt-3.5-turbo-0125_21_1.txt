To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur in a round.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6 balls in total, and we need to choose 2 balls for each child.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 balls for A is C(6,2) = 15.
- After A has chosen their 2 balls, there are 4 remaining balls for B to choose from, so the number of ways for B to choose 2 out of 4 is C(4,2) = 6.
- Once A and B have chosen their balls, the balls for C are determined. Therefore, there is only 1 way for C to receive the remaining 2 balls.
- The total number of ways for case 1 to occur is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Following similar logic as above, the number of ways for A to choose 2 out of 6 balls is C(6,2) = 15.
- B then chooses 3 out of the remaining 4 balls, which gives us C(4,3) = 4 ways.
- Finally, there is only 1 way left for C to receive the single ball.
- The total number of ways for case 2 to occur is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
