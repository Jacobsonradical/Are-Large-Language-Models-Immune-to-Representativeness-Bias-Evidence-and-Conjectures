To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:

There are a total of 6 balls, with 2 going to each child. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls as follows:

6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways

Case 2:

Similarly, for Case 2, we have 6 balls with 2 going to Child A, 3 going to Child B, and 1 going to Child C. Calculating the number of ways to distribute the balls:

6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game, as there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur compared to only 60 ways for case 2.
