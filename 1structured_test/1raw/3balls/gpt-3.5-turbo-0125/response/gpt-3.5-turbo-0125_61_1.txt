To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to consider the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

There are 6 balls in total, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2) = 15 ways. Once A has chosen their 2 balls, there are 4 remaining balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is C(4,2) = 6 ways. Finally, the last 2 balls go to C. Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, there are C(6,2) = 15 ways for A to choose their 2 balls. Then, there are C(4,3) = 4 ways for B to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4. The last ball automatically goes to C. Thus, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
