To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for each child.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 for child A is C(6, 2) = 15.
- After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for B.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 for child B is C(4, 2) = 6.
- The remaining 2 balls are automatically assigned to child C.
- The total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C.
- The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 for child A is C(6, 2) = 15.
- After choosing 2 balls for A, there are 4 balls left, and we need to choose 3 for B.
- The number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 for child B is C(4, 3) = 4.
- The remaining ball is automatically assigned to child C.
- The total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, there are more results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways).
