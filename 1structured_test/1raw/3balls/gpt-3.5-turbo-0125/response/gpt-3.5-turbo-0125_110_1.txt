To determine which case will have more results, let's calculate the total number of possible distributions for each case:

- For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
We can think of this as choosing 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, leaving the last 2 balls for child C.
This can be calculated using combinations:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 possible distributions for case 1.

- For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Similarly, we can choose 2 out of 6 balls for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, leaving the last ball for child C:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 possible distributions for case 2.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 possibilities) compared to case 2 (60 possibilities).
