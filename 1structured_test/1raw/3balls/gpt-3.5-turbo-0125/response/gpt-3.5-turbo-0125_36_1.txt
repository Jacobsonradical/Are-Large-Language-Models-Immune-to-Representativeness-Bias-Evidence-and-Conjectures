To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: C(4, 2) = 6
- Number of ways to distribute the last 2 balls to C: C(2, 2) = 1
- Total number of ways for case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: C(6, 2) = 15
- Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: C(4, 3) = 4
- Number of ways to distribute the last ball to C: C(1, 1) = 1
- Total number of ways for case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
