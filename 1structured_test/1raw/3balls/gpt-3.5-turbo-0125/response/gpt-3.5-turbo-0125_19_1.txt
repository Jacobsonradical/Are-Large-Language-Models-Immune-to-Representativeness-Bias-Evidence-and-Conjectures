To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: 4 choose 2 = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls are for C
Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
- The remaining 1 ball is for C
Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
