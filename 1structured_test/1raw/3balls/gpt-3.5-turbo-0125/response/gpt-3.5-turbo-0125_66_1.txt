To determine which case will occur more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are a total of 6 balls and we need to distribute 2 balls to each child.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is ${6\choose 2} = 15$.
After distributing 2 balls to child A, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is ${4\choose 2} = 6$.
Once child A and child B have received 2 balls each, child C automatically gets the remaining 2 balls.
Therefore, for case 1, there are a total of $15 * 6 = 90$ ways it can occur.

Case 2:
Similarly, there are a total of 6 balls and we need to distribute 2 balls to child A, 3 balls to child B, and 1 ball to child C.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is ${6\choose 2} = 15$.
After distributing 2 balls to child A, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is ${4\choose 3} = 4$.
Once child A and B have received their balls, child C automatically gets the remaining ball.
Therefore, for case 2, there are a total of $15 * 4 = 60$ ways it can occur.

Comparing the number of ways, we find that case 1 will occur more frequently, with 90 possible outcomes compared to 60 for case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
