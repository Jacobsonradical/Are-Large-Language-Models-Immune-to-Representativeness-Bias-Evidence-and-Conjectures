To determine which case will occur more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are a total of $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A. After child A receives 2 balls, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$ ways.

Case 2:
Similarly, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose 2 balls for child A. Then, there are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose 3 balls for child B, leaving 1 ball for child C. The total number of ways for case 2 is $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$ ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
