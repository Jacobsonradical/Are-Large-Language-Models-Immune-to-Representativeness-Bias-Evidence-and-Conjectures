To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to distribute the balls among the children in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:
6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by:
6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
