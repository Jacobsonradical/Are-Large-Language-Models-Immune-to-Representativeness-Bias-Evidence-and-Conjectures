To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probabilities of each case occurring in a single round.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2,2,2) = 6! / (2!2!2!) = 90

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2,3,1) = 6! / (2!3!1!) = 60

Therefore, in a single round of the game, case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has a higher probability of occurring compared to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
