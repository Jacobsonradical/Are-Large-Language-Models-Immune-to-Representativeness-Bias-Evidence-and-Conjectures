To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, let's consider the possible ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 balls and each child gets 2 balls.
- The number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula: 6!/(2!*2!*2!) = 90 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6 balls with different numbers assigned to each child.
- The number of ways to distribute the balls is calculated using the multiple combination formula: C(6,2)*C(4,3) = 90 ways.

Therefore, there are an equal number of possible results for case 1 and case 2 in many rounds of the game.
