To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4 choose 2 = 6 ways
- The distribution for child C is then fixed.
- Total number of ways for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
- The distribution for child C is then fixed.
- Total number of ways for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, we can see that there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
