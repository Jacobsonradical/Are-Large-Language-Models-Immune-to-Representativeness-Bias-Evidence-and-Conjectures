To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
There are 6 balls total, and we need to distribute them as 2 each to A, B, and C.
This can be done in the following way:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

For case 2:
There are 6 balls total, and we need to distribute them as 2 to A, 3 to B, and 1 to C.
This can be done in the following way:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
