To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed as follows:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 2 for B: 4 choose 2 = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls go to C: 1 way
- Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed as follows:
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: 6 choose 2 = 15 ways
- From the remaining 4 balls, choose 3 for B: 4 choose 3 = 4 ways
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C: 1 way
- Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 compared to case 2.
