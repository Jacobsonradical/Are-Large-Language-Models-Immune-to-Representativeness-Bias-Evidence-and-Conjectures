To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can first choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A in $${6 \choose 2}$$ ways, then the remaining 4 balls can be divided equally between B and C in $${4 \choose 2}$$ ways, giving a total of $${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} = 90$$ ways for case 1 to occur.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can first choose 2 balls out of the 6 for child A in $${6 \choose 2}$$ ways, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B in $${4 \choose 3}$$ ways, leaving the last ball for child C. This gives a total of $${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3} = 40$$ ways for case 2 to occur.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) as compared to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
