To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} = 15 \times 6 = 90$ ways to distribute the balls.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3} = 15 \times 4 = 60$ ways to distribute the balls.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
