To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
- The total number of ways of distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways (using multinomial coefficients).
- Therefore, case 1 can occur in 90 ways.

For case 2:
- The total number of ways of distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.
- Therefore, case 2 can occur in 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways, we see that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
