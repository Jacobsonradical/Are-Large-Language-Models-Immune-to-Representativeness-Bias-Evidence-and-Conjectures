In order to determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for A (15 ways).
- After A has chosen 2 balls, there are 4C2 ways to choose 2 balls for B (6 ways).
- The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for A (15 ways).
- After A has chosen 2 balls, there are 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls for B (4 ways).
- The remaining ball will go to C.
- Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the total number of ways each case can happen, we can see that case 1 (90 ways) will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game compared to case 2 (60 ways).
