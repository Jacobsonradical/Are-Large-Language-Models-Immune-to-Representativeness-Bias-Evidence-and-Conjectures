To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1:
- There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C. This can be done in the following way:
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- After choosing balls for A, there are 4 balls left. Choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: C(4, 2) = 6 ways
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C
- Total number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

In case 2:
- There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C. This can be done in the following way:
- Choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- After choosing balls for A, there are 4 balls left. Choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: C(4, 3) = 4 ways
- The remaining 1 ball goes to child C
- Total number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
