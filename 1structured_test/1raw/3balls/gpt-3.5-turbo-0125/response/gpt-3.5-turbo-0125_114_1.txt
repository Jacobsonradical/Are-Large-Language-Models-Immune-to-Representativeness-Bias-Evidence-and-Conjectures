To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, C has 2 balls
There are a total of $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} = 90$ ways to distribute the balls in this case. 
This is because we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining 2 balls are for C.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, C has 1 ball
There are a total of $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{3} = 40$ ways to distribute the balls in this case.
This is because we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the remaining ball is for C.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we see that there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (40 ways).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
