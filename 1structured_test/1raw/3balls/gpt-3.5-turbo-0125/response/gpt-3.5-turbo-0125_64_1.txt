To determine which case occurs more frequently, we can calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6! ways to distribute the balls among the children.
- However, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child.
- This can be calculated as 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6! ways to distribute the balls.
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) with 90 ways compared to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) with 60 ways.
