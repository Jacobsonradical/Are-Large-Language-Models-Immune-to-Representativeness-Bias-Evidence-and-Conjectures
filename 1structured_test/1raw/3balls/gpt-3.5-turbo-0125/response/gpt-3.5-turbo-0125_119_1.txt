To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6 choose 2 ways = 15 ways
- Distribute the remaining 4 balls among the other two children, which can be done in 4!/(2!2!) = 6 ways
- Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6 choose 2 ways = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4 choose 3 ways = 4 ways
- Distribute the remaining ball to child C in 1 way
- Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
