To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A receives 2 balls, B receives 2 balls, and C receives 2 balls.
There are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the 6 balls in this manner.

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
There are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the 6 balls in this manner.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 1 will occur more often than case 2, with a ratio of 90:60 which reduces to 3:2.
