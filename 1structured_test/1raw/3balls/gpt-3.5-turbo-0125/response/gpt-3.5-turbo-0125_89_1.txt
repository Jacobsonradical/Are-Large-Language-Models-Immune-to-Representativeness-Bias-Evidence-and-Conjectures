To calculate which case occurs more often, we can use combinatorics.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
- Then, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways.
- The last 2 balls go to child C automatically.
- So, the total number of ways for case 1 is $\binom{6}{2} * \binom{4}{2} = 90$ ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
- Then, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways.
- The last ball goes to child C automatically.
- So, the total number of ways for case 2 is $\binom{6}{2} * \binom{4}{3} = 40$ ways.

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (40 ways).
