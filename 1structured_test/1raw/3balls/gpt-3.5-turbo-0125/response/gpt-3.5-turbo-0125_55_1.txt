To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children where each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6!/(2!*2!*2!) = 90.

Case 2:
In this case, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this way is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6!/(2!*3!*1!) = 60.

Therefore, there are more results of Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).
