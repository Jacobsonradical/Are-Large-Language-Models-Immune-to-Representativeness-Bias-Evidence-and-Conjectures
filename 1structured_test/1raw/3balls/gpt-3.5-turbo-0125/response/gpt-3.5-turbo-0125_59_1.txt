To determine which case occurs more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
There are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways to distribute the balls in this case. 
This is because there are 6 balls total and we are distributing them to 3 children with 2 balls each, and considering that the balls are distinguishable.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
There are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways to distribute the balls in this case. 
This is because there are 6 balls total and we are distributing them to 3 children with 2, 3, and 1 ball each, and considering that the balls are distinguishable.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), the result of case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
