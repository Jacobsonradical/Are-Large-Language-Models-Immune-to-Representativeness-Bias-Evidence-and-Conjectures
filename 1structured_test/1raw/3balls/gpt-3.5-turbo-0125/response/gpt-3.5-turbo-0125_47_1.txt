To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
There are 6 balls, so the total number of ways to distribute them among 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
There are 6 balls, so the total number of ways to distribute them among 3 children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1, with 90 ways compared to 60 ways for case 2.
