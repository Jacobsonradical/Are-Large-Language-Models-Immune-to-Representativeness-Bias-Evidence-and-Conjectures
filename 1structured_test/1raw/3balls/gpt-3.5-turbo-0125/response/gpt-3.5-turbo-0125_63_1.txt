To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
There are 6 balls, with 2 each going to A, B, and C. This can be calculated as selecting 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 for C. This can be calculated as ${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 2} = 15 \cdot 6 = 90$ ways.

For case 2:
There are 6 balls, with 2 going to A, 3 going to B, and 1 going to C. This can be calculated as selecting 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 1 for C. This can be calculated as ${6 \choose 2} \cdot {4 \choose 3} = 15 \cdot 4 = 60$ ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
