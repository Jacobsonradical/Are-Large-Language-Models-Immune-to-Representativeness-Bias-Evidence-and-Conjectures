To determine which case is more likely to occur, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To distribute 2 balls to each of the 3 children, we can use the multinomial coefficient, which is calculated as follows:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To distribute 2 balls to one child, 3 balls to another child, and 1 ball to the third child, we can again use the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results for case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
