To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are a total of 6 balls and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C.
This can be calculated using combinations:
6C2 * 4C2 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C.
This can be calculated using combinations:
6C2 * 4C3 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
