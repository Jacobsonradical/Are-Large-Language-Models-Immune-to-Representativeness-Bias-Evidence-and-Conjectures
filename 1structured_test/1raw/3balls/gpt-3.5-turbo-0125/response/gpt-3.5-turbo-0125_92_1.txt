To analyze this question, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1, where A:2, B:2, C:2:
There are 6 balls in total, so we need to choose 2 for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. This can be calculated as:
6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 2 for B = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

For case 2, where A:2, B:3, C:1:
Similarly, we need to choose 2 for A, 3 for B, and the remaining 1 for C. This can be calculated as:
6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 3 for B = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
