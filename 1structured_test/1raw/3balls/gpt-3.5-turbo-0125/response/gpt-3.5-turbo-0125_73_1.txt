To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for Child A (2 balls out of 6).
- There are then 4C2 ways to choose 2 balls for Child B (2 balls out of the remaining 4).
- The remaining 2 balls will go to Child C.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is: 6C2 * 4C2 = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for Child A.
- There are then 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls for Child B (3 balls out of the remaining 4).
- The remaining ball will go to Child C.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is: 6C2 * 4C3 = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Since there are 90 ways for case 1 and 60 ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
