To determine which case occurs more often, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1:
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is 6 choose 2 = 15.
- Once A has their 2 balls, the number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B is 4 choose 2 = 6.
- Child C then gets the remaining 2 balls.
- Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

In case 2:
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is 6 choose 2 = 15.
- Once A has their 2 balls, the number of ways to choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B is 4 choose 3 = 4.
- Child C then gets the remaining 1 ball.
- Therefore, there are a total of 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the two, we see that case 1 occurs more frequently with 90 possible outcomes compared to case 2's 60 outcomes.
