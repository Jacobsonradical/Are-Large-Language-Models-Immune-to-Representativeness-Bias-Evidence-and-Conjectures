To determine which case (1 or 2) will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are 6! ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the 3 children.
- Within each distribution, there are (6 choose 2) ways to choose which 2 balls A gets, (4 choose 2) ways for B, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
- So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Similarly, there are 6! ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.
- A must get 2 balls, B must get 3 balls, and C must get 1 ball.
- There are (6 choose 2) ways to choose the balls for A, (4 choose 3) ways for B, and the remaining ball goes to C.
- So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways, we see that there are more results for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways).
