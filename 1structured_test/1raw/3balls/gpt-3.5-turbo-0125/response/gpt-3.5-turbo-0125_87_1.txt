To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1:
- There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.
- After A has received 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining for B, and the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to B is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$.
- Once A and B have received 4 balls, C will automatically receive the remaining 2 balls.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 to occur is 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2:
- There are a total of 6 balls, so the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.
- After A has received 2 balls, there are 4 balls remaining for B, and the number of ways to distribute 3 balls to B is ${4 \choose 3} = 4$.
- Once A and B have received a total of 5 balls, C will automatically receive the remaining 1 ball.
- Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 to occur is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the results, we see that there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
