To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur. 

Case 1:
For case 1, where A, B, and C each receive 2 balls, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls by using the combination formula. 
There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to C. 
Therefore, the number of ways for case 1 to occur is: 
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

Case 2:
For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls similarly. 
Choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. 
Therefore, the number of ways for case 2 to occur is: 
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that case 1 (90 ways) will occur more frequently than case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
