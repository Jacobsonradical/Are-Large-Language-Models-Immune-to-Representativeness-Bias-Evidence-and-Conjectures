To determine which case occurs more frequently, let's calculate the number of ways each case can happen.

In case 1 where A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls:
- First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B. The last 2 balls go to C.
- Number of ways = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

In case 2 where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:
- First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then choose 3 out of the remaining 4 for B. The last ball goes to C.
- Number of ways = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 than case 2.
