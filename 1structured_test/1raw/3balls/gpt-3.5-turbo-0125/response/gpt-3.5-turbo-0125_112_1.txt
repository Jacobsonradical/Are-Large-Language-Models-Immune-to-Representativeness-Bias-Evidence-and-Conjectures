To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- There are a total of 6 distinguishable balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2) = 15.
- After choosing 2 balls for child A, there are 4 balls remaining for child B, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child B is C(4,2) = 6.
- The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

Therefore, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- There are a total of 6 distinguishable balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2) = 15.
- After choosing 2 balls for child A, there are 4 balls remaining for child B, so the number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B is C(4,3) = 4.
- The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

Therefore, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the results, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
