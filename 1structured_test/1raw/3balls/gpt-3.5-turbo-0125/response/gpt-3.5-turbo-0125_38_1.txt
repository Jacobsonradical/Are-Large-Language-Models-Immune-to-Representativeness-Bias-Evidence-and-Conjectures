To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In order for A to have 2 balls, B to have 2 balls, and C to have 2 balls, we can treat this as a combination problem. We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 for C.
This can be calculated as: C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

Case 2:
Similarly, for A to have 2 balls, B to have 3 balls, and C to have 1 ball, we can calculate: C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
