To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
There are 6 balls and we need to distribute them in groups of 2 to each of the 3 children.
So, the number of ways case 1 can occur is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2:
Similarly, the number of ways case 2 can occur is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60

Thus, there are more possible results of case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).
