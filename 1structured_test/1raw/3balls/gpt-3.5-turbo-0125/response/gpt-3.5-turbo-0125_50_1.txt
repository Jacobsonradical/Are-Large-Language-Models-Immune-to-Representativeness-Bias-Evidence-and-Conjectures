To determine which case will have more results, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls in total, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 2 for child B, and 2 for child C.
This can be calculated using combinations: 6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 2 for B * 2 choose 2 for C = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, there are 6 balls in total, and we need to choose 2 for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C.
Using combinations: 6 choose 2 for A * 4 choose 3 for B * 1 choose 1 for C = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 {case: 1}.
