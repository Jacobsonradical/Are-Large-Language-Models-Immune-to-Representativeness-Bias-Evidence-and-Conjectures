To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 for child C. The total number of ways this can occur is given by:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball for child C. The total number of ways this can occur is given by:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
