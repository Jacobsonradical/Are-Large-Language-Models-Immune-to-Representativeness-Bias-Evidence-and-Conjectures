To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1:
In order for child A to receive 2 balls, there are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 balls out of 6. Similarly, there are 15 ways for child B to receive 2 balls and 1 way for child C to receive the remaining 2 balls. Therefore, there are $15 \times 15 \times 1 = 225$ ways for case 1 to occur.

Case 2:
Similarly, there are ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ ways for child A to receive 2 balls. There are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ ways for child B to receive 3 balls, and the remaining ball goes to child C. Therefore, there are $15 \times 4 \times 1 = 60$ ways for case 2 to occur.

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, we can see that case 1 has more results in many rounds of the game.
