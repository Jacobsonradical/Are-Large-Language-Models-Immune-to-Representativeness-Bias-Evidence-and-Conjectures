To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the total number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A receives 2 balls, B receives 2 balls, and C receives 2 balls
There are 6!/(2!*2!*2!) = 90 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball
There are 6!/(2!*3!*1!) = 60 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways) in many rounds of the game.
