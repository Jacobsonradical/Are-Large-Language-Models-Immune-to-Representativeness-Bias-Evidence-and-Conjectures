To answer this question, we need to determine the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We'll use combinatorics to find the number of ways to distribute the balls.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items (balls), r is the number of items in one group (balls for each child), and "!" denotes factorial.

In this case, n = 6 (total balls), and r = 2 (balls for each child). So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 720 / (2 * 24) = 15

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This can be done by finding the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A and B and then finding the number of ways to distribute the remaining ball to C:

1) C(6, 5) (number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A and B) = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 720 / (5 * 6) = 120
2) Then, we find the number of ways to distribute the remaining ball to C: C(5, 1) = 5! / (1!(5-1)!) = 5

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

120 * 5 = 600

Comparing the two cases:

case 1: 15
case 2: 600

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
