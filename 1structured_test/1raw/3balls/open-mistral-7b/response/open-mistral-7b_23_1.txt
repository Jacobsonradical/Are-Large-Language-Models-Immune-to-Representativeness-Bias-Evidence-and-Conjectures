To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among A, B, and C in each case, and then compare those numbers.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be represented as: A(2)B(2)C(2)
There are 6! (720) ways to arrange these balls, but since the order does not matter, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 identical groups of 2 balls each (3! * 2!^3 = 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 48) and multiply by the number of ways to choose 3 children out of 3 (3! = 6) to get the total number of distributions:

Total distributions for case 1 = 6! / (3! * 2!^3) * 6 = 720 / (6 * 2^3) = 720 / 288 = 3

In case 2, the distribution of balls can be represented as: A(2)B(3)C(1)
Again, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 identical groups of 2, 3, and 1 balls each (3! * 2!^2 * 1! = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 24) and multiply by the number of ways to choose 3 children out of 3 (3! = 6) to get the total number of distributions:

Total distributions for case 2 = 6! / (3! * 2!^2 * 1!) * 6 = 720 / (6 * 2^2 * 1) = 720 / 48 = 15

Comparing the total distributions for both cases, we can see that there will be more results of case 2 (15) than case 1 (3) in many rounds of the game.
