To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We'll use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This can be done by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from a pool of 6 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This can be done by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from a pool of 6 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)

Now that we have the number of ways to distribute the balls for both cases, we can compare them and determine which case is more likely to occur.

Let's denote the number of ways for case 1 as N1 and the number of ways for case 2 as N2.

N1 = C(6, 2, 2, 2)
N2 = C(6, 2, 3, 1)

Now, let's compute both values:

N1 = 720 / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / 8 = 90
N2 = 720 / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / 6 = 120

Since N1 = 90 and N2 = 120, both distributions have the same probability of occurring if the game is played many times. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1 or 2, 1}

However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that each distribution is equally likely to occur each round, which may not be the case in practice if there are other factors influencing the distribution of the balls.
