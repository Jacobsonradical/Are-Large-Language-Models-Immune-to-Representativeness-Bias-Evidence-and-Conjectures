To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in each case:

1. Case 1: A receives 2 balls, B receives 2 balls, and C receives 2 balls. This can be done in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

2. Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. This can be done in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) ways.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for each case:

1. Case 1 probability: (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)) / C(9, 6)
2. Case 2 probability: (C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1)) / C(9, 6)

Since the probabilities are the same for both cases, we cannot directly say which case will occur more frequently. However, if we assume that each distribution is an independent event (which is reasonable for this scenario), we can say that the long-term frequency of each case will be proportional to its probability. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that there will be more results of case 1 or case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

This answer is not typically what is expected, as the question is usually asked with the assumption that the cases are not equally likely. In such cases, more advanced probability theories, like generating functions or combinatorial analysis, would be needed to solve the problem.
