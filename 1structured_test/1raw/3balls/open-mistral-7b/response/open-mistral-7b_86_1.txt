To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We'll use the concept of multinomial coefficients.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C so that each child gets at least 2 balls:

1. At least 2 balls for A, B, and C means a minimum of 6-2 = 4 balls shared among them.
2. The remaining 2 balls can be distributed among any of the three children.
3. So, the number of ways to distribute the 2 shared balls is C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3 ways.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in the two cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- This can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- This can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 42 = 630 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur, we can say that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2:
{case: 2, 1}

Therefore, the probability of having more results of case 2 than case 1 is higher.
