To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the distribution can be achieved in 3! (factorial of 3) ways because the order of distribution does not matter. The factorial of 3 is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to 3, so 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the distribution can be achieved in 3! * 2! (factorial of 2 for the 2 identical balls distributed to child B) ways because the order of distribution for children A and C does not matter, and the order of distributing the 2 identical balls to child B does matter. So, the number of ways for case 2 is 6 * 2 = 12.

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 2 than in case 1, we can expect more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1 is the other option, but we found that there are more results for case 2}
