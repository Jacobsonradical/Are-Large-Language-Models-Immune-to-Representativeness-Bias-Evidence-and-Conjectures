To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways (choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from the total 6 balls).

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways (choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from the total 6 balls).

Now let's find the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to the number of ways for case 2:

(C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)) / (C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1))

This simplifies to:

(6*4*1)/(6*4*1 + 6*4*3 + 6*1*2)

This further simplifies to:

1/19

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur than case 2, we can say that there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1}
