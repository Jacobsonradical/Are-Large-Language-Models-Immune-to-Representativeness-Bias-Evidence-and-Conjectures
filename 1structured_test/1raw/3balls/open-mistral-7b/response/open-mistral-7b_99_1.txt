To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6! (720) ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without considering order. However, we need to consider the order since each distribution is unique. The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 to B, and 2 to C is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

So, there are 90 ways for case 1 to occur.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 to B, and 1 to C is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, there are 60 ways for case 2 to occur.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) compared to case 2 (60), we can conclude that:
{case: 1, 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
