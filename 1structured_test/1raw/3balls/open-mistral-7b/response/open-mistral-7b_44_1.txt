To answer this question, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case and compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be represented as C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways, since there are 15 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child.

In case 2, the distribution of balls can be represented as C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 42 * 2 = 1260 ways, since there are 42 ways to choose 3 balls out of 4 for child B.

However, in case 2, we need to subtract the number of times that case 1 occurs, because if we distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C, it can also be considered as 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 0 balls to C. This can be done by considering the distribution of balls when we distribute 0 balls to child A: C(6, 0) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 2) = 1 * 42 * 15 = 630 ways.

So, the actual number of ways for case 2 is 1260 - 630 = 630.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 is 90/3^6 and the probability of case 2 is 630/3^6.

Since the game is repeated many times, the probability of each case occurring in each round is the same. Therefore, the number of times case 1 occurs will be approximately equal to the number of times case 2 occurs, in the long run.

{case: 1, 1}

However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical answer and in practice, due to randomness, the actual number of times each case occurs may not be exactly equal.
