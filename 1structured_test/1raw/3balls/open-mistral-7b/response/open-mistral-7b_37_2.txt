To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be represented as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from the 6 available balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 ways (combinations).

In case 2, the distribution of balls can be represented as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from the 6 available balls. This can be done in 6C2 * C(6,3) * 6C1 ways (combinations).

Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375
Case 2: 6C2 * C(6,3) * 6C1 = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700

Comparing the results, we can see that there are more possibilities for case 1 (3375) than for case 2 (2700). So, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2.
