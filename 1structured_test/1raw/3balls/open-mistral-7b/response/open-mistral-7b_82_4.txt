To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and determine which one has a higher probability.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This case can be achieved in 3! (3 factorial) ways, as the order of distribution does not matter. 3! equals 6.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This case can also be achieved in 3! ways, but there are more ways to distribute the balls in this case since B has one more ball. The number of ways to choose 3 balls from 6 for B, and 1 ball for C, is given by the combination formula C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways of case 1 / Total number of ways
                                    = 6 / (6*6*6)
                                    = 1 / 216

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways of case 2 / Total number of ways
                                    = 20 / (6*6*6)
                                    = 1 / 21

Since the probability of case 2 is higher than that of case 1, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times: more often}
