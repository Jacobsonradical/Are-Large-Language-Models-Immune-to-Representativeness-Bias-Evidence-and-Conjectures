To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1, the balls are distributed among A, B, and C as 2, 2, 2. This can be achieved in 3! (factorial of 3) ways:
1. A gets first two balls, then B gets the next two, and finally C gets the last two.
2. A gets first two balls, then C gets the next two, and finally B gets the last two.
3. B gets first two balls, then A gets the next two, and finally C gets the last two.
4. B gets first two balls, then C gets the next two, and finally A gets the last two.
5. C gets first two balls, then A gets the next two, and finally B gets the last two.
6. C gets first two balls, then B gets the next two, and finally A gets the last two.

So, there are 6 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

In case 2, the balls are distributed as 2, 3, 1. This can be achieved in 3! * 2! (factorial of 3 times factorial of 2) ways:
1. A gets first two balls, then B gets the next three balls.
2. A gets first two balls, then C gets the next three balls.
3. B gets first two balls, then A gets the next three balls.
4. B gets first two balls, then C gets the next three balls.
5. C gets first two balls, then A gets the next three balls.
6. C gets first two balls, then B gets the next three balls.

For the remaining three balls to be distributed among B and C, there are C(3, 1) = 3 ways to do it. So, there are 6 * 3 = 18 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
