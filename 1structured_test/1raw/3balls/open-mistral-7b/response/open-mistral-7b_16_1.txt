To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in each case:

1. In case 1, we have 3 choices for distributing 2 balls to A, then 3 choices for distributing 2 balls to B, and finally 3 choices for distributing 2 balls to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 3C2 * 3C2 * 3C2 = 288 ways.

2. In case 2, we have 3 choices for distributing 2 balls to A, 6 choices for distributing 3 balls to B, and 3 choices for distributing 1 ball to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 3C2 * 6C3 * 3C1 = 288 * 20 * 3 = 2160 ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case. Since the distribution is random, we assume that each distribution is equally likely.

1. The probability of case 1 is the number of ways for case 1 divided by the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children. So, the probability of case 1 is 288 ways / (3C2 * 3C2 * 3C2 + 3C2 * 6C3 * 3C1) = 288 / (288 + 2160) = 288 / 2448 ≈ 0.117.

2. The probability of case 2 is the number of ways for case 2 divided by the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children. So, the probability of case 2 is 2160 ways / (288 + 2160) = 2160 / 2448 ≈ 0.873.

Since the probability of case 2 (0.873) is greater than the probability of case 1 (0.117), we can conclude that, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that, in the long run, you will see more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in the game.
