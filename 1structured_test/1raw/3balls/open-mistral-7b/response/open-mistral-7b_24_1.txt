To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children in each case.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be done in 6! (factorial of 6) ways, as we need to choose 2 balls for each child from 6 available balls. However, since the order of distribution doesn't matter (AB is the same as BA), we need to divide by the number of permutations of 3 children (3! = 6). So, the number of ways for Case 1 is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 120 ways.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 1!) = 180 ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is (6! / (3! * 3!)) = 120 ways.

The probability of Case 1 is the number of ways for Case 1 divided by the total number of ways: 120 / 120 = 1.
The probability of Case 2 is the number of ways for Case 2 divided by the total number of ways: 180 / 120 = 1.5.

As both probabilities are equal to 1, it means that in the long run (many rounds), the game will result in an equal number of Case 1 and Case 2 results. However, in a single round, the outcome can be either Case 1 or Case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

However, if you meant to ask which case will occur more frequently in a single round, the answer would be different. Since both cases have the same probability, there is no guarantee that either case will occur more frequently in a single round. The probability of either case is 1/2.

Sorry for the confusion, I misunderstood the question at first.
