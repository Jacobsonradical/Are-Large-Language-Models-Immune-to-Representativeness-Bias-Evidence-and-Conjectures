To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in each case and then compare those numbers.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r1, r2, r3) = n! / (r1! * r2! * r3!)

where n = 6 (total balls), r1 = 2 (balls for A), r2 = 2 (balls for B), and r3 = 2 (balls for C).

So, for case 1, the number of ways is:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we expect to see more results of this case in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that, in the long run, you will see more instances of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
