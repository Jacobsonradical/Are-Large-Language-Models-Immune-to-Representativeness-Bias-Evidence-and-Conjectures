To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This means that we are looking for ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups, each containing 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items in each group.

Here, n = 6 (total balls) and k = 2 (balls in each group). So, the number of ways for case 1 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This means that we are looking for ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups, with 2 balls in the first group, 3 balls in the second group, and 1 ball in the third group. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient formula: C(n, k1, k2, ..., kt) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kt!), where n is the total number of items, and ki is the number of items in the ith group.

Here, n = 6 (total balls), k1 = 2 (balls in A's group), k2 = 3 (balls in B's group), and k3 = 1 (ball in C's group). So, the number of ways for case 2 is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 ways.

Comparing the two, there are more ways for case 2 (20) than for case 1 (15). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of occurrences: more}
