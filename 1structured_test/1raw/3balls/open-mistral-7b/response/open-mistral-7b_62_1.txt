To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare those numbers.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the children can distribute the balls in 3! (3 factorial) ways because the order does not matter. The formula for 3! is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the children can distribute the balls in 2! * 3! ways because first, the balls for child A and B can be distributed in 2! ways (2 * 1 = 2), and then the remaining ball for child C can be distributed in 3! ways. Multiplying these two numbers gives us the total number of ways for case 2: 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's find the ratio of the number of ways in case 1 to the number of ways in case 2: 6 (case 1) / 12 (case 2) = 0.5.

Since this ratio is less than 1, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

Answer: There will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
