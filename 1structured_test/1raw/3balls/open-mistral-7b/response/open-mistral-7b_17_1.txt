To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then determine which one has more possibilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6! (720) ways to distribute the balls among the three children in total. Since we want to distribute the balls in a specific way (2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C), we need to count the number of ways that can be achieved. This can be done by multiplying the number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for each child:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (2! * 4!))
                                                          = (720 / (2 * 24)) * (720 / (2 * 24)) * (720 / (2 * 24))
                                                          = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated similarly:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (6! / (1! * 5!))
                                                          = (720 / (2 * 24)) * (20 * 20) * (6)
                                                          = 15 * 400 * 6 = 28800

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, we can see that case 2 has more possibilities than case 1.

{case: 2, 1 implies fewer possibilities, so 2 implies more possibilities}
