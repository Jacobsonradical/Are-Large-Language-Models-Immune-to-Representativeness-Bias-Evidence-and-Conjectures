To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This distribution can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. The total number of ways is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This distribution can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) ways. The total number of ways is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways).

{case: 1, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you will observe the distribution of balls as in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
