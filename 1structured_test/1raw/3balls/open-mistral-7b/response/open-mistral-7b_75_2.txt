To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) can be achieved in 3! (3 factorial) ways because the distribution of balls to each child does not matter (order doesn't matter). So, there are 3! ways to distribute the balls in this case.

3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) can also be achieved in 3! ways, but since A and B have more balls than C, we need to consider how many ways we can choose 3 balls for A and B together and then distribute the remaining ball to C. We can do this using combinations, which is a way to choose items without considering the order.

The number of ways to choose 3 balls from 5 (for A and B) is C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10 ways

Now, we can distribute the remaining ball to C in 3! ways (order doesn't matter). So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

10 * 3! = 10 * 6 = 60 ways

So, there are more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1} indicates that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
