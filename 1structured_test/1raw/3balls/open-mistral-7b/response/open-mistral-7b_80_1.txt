To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare those numbers. We will use the concept of combinations, which is a way of counting arrangements without considering the order.

In case 1, we are distributing 6 balls among three children with each having 2 balls. This can be achieved in the following way:
- Choose 2 balls for child A from 6 (C(6,2)), then choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 (C(4,2)), and finally choose 2 balls for child C from the remaining 2 (C(2,2)).
- Or, we can choose 2 balls for child B first, then 2 balls for child A, and finally 2 balls for child C. This is the same distribution, but we are considering the order, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 3! (3 factorial) to avoid double-counting.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) / 3!

Similarly, in case 2, we can distribute the balls as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for child A from 6, then choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4, and finally choose 1 ball for child C from the remaining 1.
- Or, we can choose 2 balls for child A first, then 1 ball for child C, and finally 3 balls for child B. This is the same distribution, but we are considering the order, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 3!

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,1) * C(1,1) / 3!

Now we can compare the two numbers to see which distribution is more likely to occur. Let's calculate the values:

For case 1:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) / 3! = (15 * 6) / 6 = 90

For case 2:
C(6,2) * C(4,1) * C(1,1) / 3! = (15 * 4) / 6 = 60

Since 90 is greater than 60, it means that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

Answer: In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
