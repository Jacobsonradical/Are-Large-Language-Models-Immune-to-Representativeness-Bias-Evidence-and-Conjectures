To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use the concept of combinations from combinatorics.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1:
- The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A is C(6, 2) = 15
- The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to B is also C(6, 2) = 15
- The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to C is also C(6, 2) = 15
- To find the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1, we multiply the number of ways for each child: Total cases 1 = 15 * 15 * 15 = 33,750

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2:
- The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A is C(6, 2) = 15
- The number of ways to distribute 3 balls to B is C(6, 3) = 20
- The number of ways to distribute 1 ball to C is C(6, 1) = 6
- To find the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we multiply the number of ways for each child: Total cases 2 = 15 * 20 * 6 = 27,300

Comparing the total number of ways for both cases, we can see that there are more results of case 1 (33,750) than case 2 (27,300).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you will see more results of children A, B, and C having 2 balls each, than having 2 balls for A and B, and 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.
