To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n+k-1, k-1) = (n+k-1)! / [(k-1)! * (n-1)!]

For our problem, n = 6 (total balls) and k = 3 (children).

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) * C(3, 1) = 28 * 3 = 84

Now, let's assume that each distribution is equally likely in many rounds of the game. In this case, the probability of observing case 1 is 28/112 (since there are 28 ways out of a total of 112 possible distributions) and the probability of observing case 2 is 84/112.

Since the probabilities of both cases are positive, there is no guarantee that one case will occur more frequently than the other in the long run. However, based on the given probabilities, case 2 is more likely to occur than case 1.

{case: 2, 1 or 2 cannot be used here since we are comparing the probability of case 1 to the probability of case 2}
