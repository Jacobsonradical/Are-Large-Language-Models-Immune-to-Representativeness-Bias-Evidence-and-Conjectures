To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. Since there are 6 balls in total and each child gets at least 1 ball, there are C(6, 3) = 20 ways to distribute the balls among the children with this distribution.

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and C(2, 1) ways to choose 1 ball for child C. So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the product of these three values:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

P(case 1) = Number of ways in case 1 / Total possible ways = 20 / C(6, 3) = 20 / 20 = 1
P(case 2) = Number of ways in case 2 / Total possible ways = 120 / C(6, 3) = 120 / 20 = 6

Since the game is played many times, the probability that it results in a specific case is the probability of that case multiplied by the number of rounds. If we assume that each round is independent, the overall probability of getting a specific case over many rounds is the product of the probability of getting that case in a single round and the number of rounds.

So, the overall probability of getting case 1 over many rounds is 1 * Number of rounds and the overall probability of getting case 2 over many rounds is 6 * Number of rounds.

Since the number of rounds is large, we can expect that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2, because the probability of case 1 is always 1 and the probability of case 2 is less than 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
