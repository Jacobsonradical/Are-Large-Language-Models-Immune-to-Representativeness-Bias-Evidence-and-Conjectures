To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) = 8!/(3!5!) = 56 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) = 8!/(3!5!) = 56 ways.

Since both cases have the same number of ways, we cannot definitively say that one case will occur more often than the other in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

However, it's important to note that this answer is based on the assumption that each distribution is equally likely. In a real-world situation, there might be factors influencing the distribution that are not accounted for in this analysis. For example, if the children have different preferences for the balls or different abilities to pick them up, the distribution might not be completely random.
