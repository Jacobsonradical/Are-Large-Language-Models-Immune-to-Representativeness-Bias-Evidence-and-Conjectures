To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the distribution of balls can be achieved in 6!/([2!] * [2!] * [2!]) = 720/48 = 15 ways, since the order of distribution among children does not matter.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the distribution of balls can be achieved in 6!/([2!] * [3!] * [1!]) = 720/120 = 6 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we see that case 1 has a higher number of possibilities (15) than case 2 (6). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer:
{case: 1, 1}
