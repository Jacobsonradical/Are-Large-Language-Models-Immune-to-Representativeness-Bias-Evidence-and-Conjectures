To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (6) ways to distribute the balls among the three children.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 ways to distribute the balls.

The probability of case 1 is 6/C(6, 3) = 6/20 = 3/10
The probability of case 2 is 15/C(6, 3) = 15/20 = 3/4

Since the probability of each case occurring is independent in each round, we can compare the probabilities to determine which case is more likely to occur. In this case, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is more likely to occur than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in the long run, case 2 will occur more often than case 1.
