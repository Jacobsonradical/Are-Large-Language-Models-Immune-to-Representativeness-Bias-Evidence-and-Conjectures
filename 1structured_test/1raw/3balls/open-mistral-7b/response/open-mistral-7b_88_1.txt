To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 42 * 2 = 1260 ways

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways
                                  = 90 / (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) + C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1))
                                  = 90 / (15 * 6 * 1 + 15 * 42 * 2)
                                  = 90 / 945
                                  ≈ 0.096

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways
                                  = 1260 / (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) + C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1))
                                  = 1260 / 945
                                  ≈ 1.32

Since the probability of Case 2 is approximately 1.32, which is greater than 1, this means that the probability of having more rounds like Case 2 than Case 1 is not possible. Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
