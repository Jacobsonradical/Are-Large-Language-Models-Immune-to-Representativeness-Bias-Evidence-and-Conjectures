To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3 ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and 3 ways to choose 2 balls for child C. Since the order doesn't matter (distinguishable balls), we multiply these possibilities: 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways for A, 3! = 6 ways for B, 3! = 6 ways for C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3 ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 4 ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and 3 ways to choose 1 ball for child C. The total number of ways for case 2 is 3 * C(6, 3) * 3 = 3 * 20 * 3 = 180.

Since there are more ways for case 1 (216) than for case 2 (180), we can expect there to be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

This means that in the long run, you are more likely to see the distribution of balls as in case 1 than in case 2.
