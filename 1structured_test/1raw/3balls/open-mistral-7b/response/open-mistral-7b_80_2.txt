To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways, where C(n, r) is the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) ways.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for each case:

Probability of Case 1 = (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)) / (C(9, 3))
Probability of Case 2 = (C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)) / (C(9, 3))

Since the probabilities for both cases are equal, we can say that there will be an equal number of results for both cases in the long run.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 2,  equal number of occurrences}
