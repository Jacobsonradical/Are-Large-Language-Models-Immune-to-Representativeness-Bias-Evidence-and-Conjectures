To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare those numbers.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into three groups (A, B, and C) with specific numbers of balls in each group. This is a multinomial coefficient problem. The multinomial coefficient for the distribution A:x, B:y, C:z is given by:

C(n; x, y, z) = n! / (x! * y! * z!)

where n is the total number of balls, and x, y, and z are the numbers of balls in groups A, B, and C, respectively.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 ways

Now, we compare the number of ways for both cases. There are more ways for case 2 to occur (20) than for case 1 (15).

{case: 2, 1 for case 1}

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
