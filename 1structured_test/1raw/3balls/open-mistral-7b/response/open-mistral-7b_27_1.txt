To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then find the ratio of these numbers.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the balls among the children, as the order doesn't matter. The formula for 3! is 3*2*1 = 6.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have 3 choices for the child who gets 1 ball (let's say C), then 3 choices for the child who gets 3 balls (let's say B), and finally 6 choices for distributing the 2 balls between A and the remaining 2 balls. So, there are 3*3*6 = 108 ways to arrange the balls in this case.

Now, we can calculate the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to the number of ways for case 2:

Ratio = Ways for case 1 / Ways for case 2
             = 6 / 108
             = 1 / 18

Since the ratio is less than 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
