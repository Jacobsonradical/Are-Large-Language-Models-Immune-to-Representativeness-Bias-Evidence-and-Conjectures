To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a combination problem where order doesn't matter, so we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group.

In this case, n = 6 (total balls), and k = 2 (balls for each child A, B, and C). So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!))
= 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Now, let's find the number of ways for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). The formula for combinations is still the same, but the number of balls for child B changed. So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (6! / (1!(6-1)!))
= 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700

Comparing the two results, we can see that there are more ways for case 1 (3375) than for case 2 (2700). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

In other words, in more rounds of the game, the result of distributing balls as in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely than the result of distributing balls as in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
