To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each case occurs:

1. Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

   So, there are C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 180 ways to have case 1.

2. Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) ways.

   So, there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways to have case 2.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

1. Probability of case 1 = Number of ways to have case 1 / Total number of ways to distribute the balls

   Total number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6,3) = 20. So, the probability of case 1 is 180 / 20 = 9.

2. Probability of case 2 = Number of ways to have case 2 / Total number of ways to distribute the balls

   Total number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6,3) = 20. So, the probability of case 2 is 60 / 20 = 3.

Since the probability of case 1 is greater than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
