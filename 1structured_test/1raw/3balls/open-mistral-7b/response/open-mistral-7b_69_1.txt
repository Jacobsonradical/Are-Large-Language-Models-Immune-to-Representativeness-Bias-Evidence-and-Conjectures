To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then determine which distribution has a higher probability of occurring.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This distribution can be achieved in C(6,2) × C(4,2) × C(2,2) ways, where C(n,r) represents the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This distribution can be achieved in C(6,2) × C(4,3) × C(1,1) ways.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for both cases:

Probability of Case 1 = (C(6,2) × C(4,2) × C(2,2)) / C(9,6)
Probability of Case 2 = (C(6,2) × C(4,3) × C(1,1)) / C(9,6)

The denominators in both expressions are the same, so we only need to calculate the numerators:

Probability of Case 1 ≈ 720 / 84
Probability of Case 2 ≈ 720 / 126

Now, we simply compare the probabilities:

Probability of Case 1 > Probability of Case 2

Since the probability of Case 1 is greater than that of Case 2, we can conclude that there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

Final answer: There will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
