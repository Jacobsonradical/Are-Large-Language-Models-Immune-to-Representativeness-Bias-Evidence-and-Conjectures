To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) ways, where 6! is the total number of arrangements of 6 balls, and 2! is the number of arrangements of 2 balls.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways in Case 1 / Total number of ways
                                 = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) / (6! / (3! * 3! * 1!))
                                 = (3! * 2!) / (3! * 2! * 2!)
                                 = 1

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways in Case 2 / Total number of ways
                                 = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) / (6! / (3! * 3! * 1!))
                                 = 3! * 1! / (3! * 2! * 1!)
                                 = 1 / 2

Since the game is repeated many times, the probability of each case occurring in each round is the same. Therefore, the expected number of times Case 1 occurs is equal to the number of rounds, and the expected number of times Case 2 occurs is half the number of rounds.

If the number of rounds is even, the expected number of times Case 2 occurs is greater than the number of times Case 1 occurs. If the number of rounds is odd, the expected number of times Case 1 occurs is greater than the number of times Case 2 occurs.

In summary, the answer is:
{case: It depends on the number of rounds, 1 or 2}
