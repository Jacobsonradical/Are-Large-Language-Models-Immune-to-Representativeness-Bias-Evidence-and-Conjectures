To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the balls are distributed equally among the three children. This can be done in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 6 ways, since each child gets 2 balls and the order doesn't matter.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the balls are not distributed equally. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C, which can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120 ways.

Comparing the two, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 2 (120) than in case 1 (6). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This is because in case 2, there are more ways to choose the number of balls for each child, since A and B get more balls than C. This increases the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case.
