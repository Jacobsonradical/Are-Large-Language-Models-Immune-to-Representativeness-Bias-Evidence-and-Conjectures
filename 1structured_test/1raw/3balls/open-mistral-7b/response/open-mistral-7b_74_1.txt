To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(6+3-1,3) = C(8,3) = 56.

The probability of case 1 is [C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)] / C(8,3).
The probability of case 2 is [C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1)] / C(8,3).

Since the total number of possible distributions is constant for both cases, the probability of having more results of case 1 than case 2 is equivalent to the probability of having more results of case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that, in the long run, there will be more rounds where the balls are distributed according to case 1 than case 2.
