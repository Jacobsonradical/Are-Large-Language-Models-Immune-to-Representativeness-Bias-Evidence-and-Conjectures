To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n items among r groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n + r - 1, n, r - 1, ..., r - 1)

where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of groups.

In our case, n = 6 (balls), and r = 3 (children). The multinomial coefficients for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) are:

Case 1: C(6 + 3 - 1, 6, 3, 3, 3) = C(8, 6, 3, 3, 3)
Case 2: C(6 + 3 - 1, 6, 3, 3, 2) = C(8, 6, 3, 3, 2)

Using a calculator or combinatorics software, we find that the number of ways to distribute the balls for case 1 is 56, and for case 2 is 84.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times more frequent: 1}

In other words, in many rounds of the game, you will observe the distribution in case 2 more frequently than case 1.
