To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them.

Let's first calculate the probabilities for both cases:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in 6! (factorial of 6) ways, but we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 children with 3 sets of 2 balls each. So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

Number of ways for case 1 = (6! / (3! * 2! * 2!))

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be achieved in different ways. First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively. This can be calculated as:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 1 * 2 = 30

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways for case 1 / Total possible outcomes
Total possible outcomes = C(6, 3) = 20

Probability of case 1 = (6! / (3! * 2! * 2!)) / 20

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways for case 2 / Total possible outcomes
Total possible outcomes = C(6, 3) = 20

Probability of case 2 = 30 / 20

Since both probabilities are positive values, we cannot say that one case will definitely occur more often than the other. However, we can calculate the expected number of occurrences for each case by multiplying the probability of each case by the total number of rounds.

Expected number of occurrences for case 1 = Probability of case 1 * Total rounds
Expected number of occurrences for case 2 = Probability of case 2 * Total rounds

So, if you run the game many times, the expected number of times that case 1 occurs is not necessarily more than the expected number of times that case 2 occurs.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: Neither, 0}

This answer may seem counterintuitive, but it is due to the symmetric nature of the problem. In other words, the number of ways to distribute the balls among the children is the same for case 1 and case 2, even though the outcomes look different.
