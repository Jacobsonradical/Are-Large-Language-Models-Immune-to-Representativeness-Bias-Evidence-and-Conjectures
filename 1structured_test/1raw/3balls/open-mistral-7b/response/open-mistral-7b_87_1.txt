To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In this case, we're interested in finding the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children so that the distribution matches either case 1 or case 2.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can think of this as choosing 2 balls for child A and assigning the remaining 4 balls to the remaining 2 children (B and C) in some way. This can be done in C(6, 2) ways (combinations of choosing 2 items from a set of 6), which is 15 ways. Then, we need to choose 2 balls for child B and 2 balls for child C from the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in C(4, 2) ways (combinations of choosing 2 items from a set of 4), which is 6 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can think of this as choosing 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball for child C. This can be done in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) ways, which is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two, we see that there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 to occur (60 ways). Therefore, the answer is {case: 1, 1}. In the long run, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
