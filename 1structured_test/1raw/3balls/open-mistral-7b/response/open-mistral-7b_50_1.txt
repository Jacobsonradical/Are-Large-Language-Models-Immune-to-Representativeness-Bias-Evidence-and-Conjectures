To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have three choices for the first ball (A, B, or C), two choices for the second ball in the same group, and one choice for the remaining two balls in the other two groups. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 3C2 * 2C2 * C2 = 720.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have three choices for the first two balls in group A, C(3,2) = 3 ways, then three choices for the first ball in group B, three choices for the second and third balls in group B, and one choice for the ball in group C. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 3! * 3! * 1 = 216.

Now, let's compare the number of ways for both cases:

1. Number of ways for case 1: 720
2. Number of ways for case 2: 216

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 than in case 2, we can conclude that {case: 1, 1} (i.e., there will be more results of case 1).
