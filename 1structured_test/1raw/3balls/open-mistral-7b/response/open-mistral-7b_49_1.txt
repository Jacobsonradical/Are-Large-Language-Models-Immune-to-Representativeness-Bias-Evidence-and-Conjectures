To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n + k-1, k-1, k-1, ..., k-1) = n! / (k-1)!^3

where n is the total number of balls (6), k is the number of children (3), and "!" denotes factorial.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have k choices for each child (A, B, or C), and we choose 2 balls for each child. So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6 + 3-1, 3-1, 3-1, 3-1) = 6! / (2!)^3 = 20

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have the same number of choices for each child, but now we choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. The number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6 + 3-1, 3-1, 3-1, 2, 1) = 6! / (2!)^2 * 3! = 126

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1 (126 > 20), we expect to see more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that there will be more occurrences of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
