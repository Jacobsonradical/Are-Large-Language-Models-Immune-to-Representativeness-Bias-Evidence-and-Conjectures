To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, there are 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to B, and 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to C. So, there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 possible ways to achieve case 1.

In case 2, there are 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to A, C(6, 3) = 20 ways to distribute 3 balls to B, and 1 way to distribute 1 ball to C. So, there are 3 * 20 * 1 = 60 possible ways to achieve case 2.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(6+2-1, 2-1) = C(8, 1) = 8 possible distributions. Since there are 27 ways to achieve case 1 and 60 ways to achieve case 2, the probability of case 1 is 27/8 and the probability of case 2 is 60/8.

To find out which case is more likely to occur, we can compare their probabilities:

27/8 < 60/8

Since 27/8 < 60/8, case 2 is more likely to occur than case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you are more likely to see the distribution of balls as in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
