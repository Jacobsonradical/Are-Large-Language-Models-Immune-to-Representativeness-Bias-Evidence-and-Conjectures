To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into three groups (A, B, and C) with the given distributions in each case. This is a problem of combinatorics, specifically combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we are looking for the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from a total of 6 balls. This can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) for each group, where C(n,r) represents the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we are looking for the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from a total of 6 balls.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(6,3) * C(6,1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700.

Since there are more ways for case 1 (3375) than for case 2 (2700), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1, 1}
