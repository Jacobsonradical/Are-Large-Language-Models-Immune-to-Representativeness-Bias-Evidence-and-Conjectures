To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n distinct objects into k nonempty groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n + k - 1, n, k - 1) = n! / [(k - 1)! (n - k)!]

Where:
- n is the number of objects
- k is the number of groups

In our case, the objects are the 6 balls, and the groups are the children A, B, and C.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have:
- n = 6
- k = 3

The number of ways for this case is:
C(6 + 3 - 1, 6, 3 - 1) = C(8, 5) = 56

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:
- n = 6
- k = 3

The number of ways for this case is:
C(6 + 3 - 1, 6, 3 - 1) = C(8, 5) = 56

Since the number of ways for both cases is the same (56), we cannot determine which case will occur more often just based on these calculations. However, in a large number of rounds, statistical fluctuations might lead to one case appearing more frequently than the other. But without further information, we cannot make a definitive statement.

So, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

This means that neither case will occur more frequently than the other in the long run. But remember, the result may vary in specific sets of games due to randomness.
