To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):

This is a combination problem, and can be solved using the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

Here, n = 6 (total balls) and r = 2 (balls for each child). So, the number of ways to distribute balls in case 1 is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):

This can be thought as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from the total 6 balls. So, the number of ways to distribute balls in case 2 is C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (6! / (1!(6-1)!)) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 900.

Now, we can find the probability of each case:

P(case 1) = Number of ways in case 1 / Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children
         = 3375 / (C(6, 3) * Total children!)
         = 3375 / (120 * 6!)
         = 5 / 252

P(case 2) = Number of ways in case 2 / Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children
         = 900 / (C(6, 3) * Total children!)
         = 900 / (120 * 6!)
         = 5 / 36

Since the probability of each case is the same (5/36), we cannot say for sure that there will be more results of one case over the other in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1 or 2, neither}
