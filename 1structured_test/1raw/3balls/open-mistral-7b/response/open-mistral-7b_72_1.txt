To answer this question, we need to understand the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be represented as choosing 2 balls for each of the three children in 6C2 (combinations of 6 items taken 2 at a time) ways. So, the number of ways for case 1 is (6C2)^3 = 1296.

In case 2, there are 3 ways to choose 2 balls for A and 2 balls for B, which is 6C2 * 6C1 = 720. Then, there are 6C1 ways to choose 1 ball for C, so the number of ways for case 2 is 720 * 6 = 4320.

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, case 2 occurs more frequently than case 1. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 is less frequent}
