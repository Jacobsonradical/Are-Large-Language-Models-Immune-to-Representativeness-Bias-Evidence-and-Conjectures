To answer this question, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to distribute the balls among the children: (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2, 2). So, the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways
                 = 6 / 6!
                 = 6 / 720
                 = 1/120

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3! ways to distribute the balls among A and C, and then 3! ways to distribute the 3 balls among B:

P(case 2) = Number of ways for case 2 * Number of ways for B
                  = (2! * 1!) * (3!)
                  = (2 * 1) * (6)
                  = 12

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

P(case 1) < P(case 2)

Since the probability of case 2 is greater, we expect that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This means that, on average, you will observe case 2 more often than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
