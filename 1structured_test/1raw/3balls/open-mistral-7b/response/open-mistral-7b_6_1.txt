To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. Let's denote the number of balls given to child A, B, and C in a round as x, y, and z respectively, where x + y + z = 6 and x, y, z â‰¥ 0.

For case 1: x = y = z = 2
For case 2: x = 2, y = 3, z = 1

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the star-and-bar method or Stirling numbers of the second kind. The formula is S(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)!k!], where n is the total number of items (balls), k is the number of items to be divided into groups (children), and ! denotes factorial.

So, the total number of possible distributions is S(6, 3).

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of case 1 = (number of ways for case 1) / (total number of ways) = (1) / S(6, 3)

Probability of case 2 = (number of ways for case 2) / (total number of ways) = (number of ways for A has 2 balls and C has 1 ball) * (number of ways for B has 3 balls) / (total number of ways)

Number of ways for A has 2 balls and C has 1 ball = S(4, 2)
Number of ways for B has 3 balls = S(3, 3)

Probability of case 2 = (S(4, 2) * S(3, 3)) / S(6, 3)

Since S(6, 3) is the same for both cases, the probability of case 1 and case 2 will be directly proportional to their respective ways of distribution. That is, the probability of case 1 is less than the probability of case 2.

However, without knowing the exact value of S(6, 3), we cannot determine the exact ratio of occurrences of one case over the other. To find the exact ratio, we would need to compute the numerical values of S(6, 3), S(4, 2), and S(3, 3).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times less than case 1 is not known}
