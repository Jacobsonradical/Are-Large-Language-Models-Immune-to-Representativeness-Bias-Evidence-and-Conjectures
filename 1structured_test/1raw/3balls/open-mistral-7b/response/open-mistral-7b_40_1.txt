To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have 6 choices for the first ball, 5 choices for the second, 4 for the third, 3 for the fourth, 2 for the fifth, and only 1 choice left for the sixth ball. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 1) * C(1, 1) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have 6 choices for the first ball, 5 choices for the second, 4 for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth (since B now has 3 balls), and 1 choice left for the sixth ball. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 1) * C(5, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(3, 3) * C(2, 1) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 60 * 2 = 12960.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, we can expect more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1 indicates fewer results, but in this case, we have more results of case 2.}
