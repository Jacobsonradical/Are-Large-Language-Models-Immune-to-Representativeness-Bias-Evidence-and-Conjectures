To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Let's denote the number of ways case 1 occurs as W1 and the number of ways case 2 occurs as W2.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is uniform among the three children, so each child gets 2 balls in 6C3 ways:
W1 = 6C3 = 20

In case 2, there are more balls given to child A and fewer to child C, so the number of ways this can happen is given by the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A and 3 balls for B from 6, and then subtracting the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A and 2 balls for B (since this would result in case 1):

W2 = (6C2 * 4C3) - (6C2 * 3C2)
   = (15 * 45) - (15 * 9)
   = 1365 - 405
   = 960

Since the total number of rounds is the sum of the ways case 1 and case 2 can occur, the probability of getting case 1 is W1/T and the probability of getting case 2 is W2/T, where T is the total number of ways to distribute the balls.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the number of ways to choose 6 balls from 18 (since there are 18 ways to assign each ball to one of the three children), which is given by 18C6:

T = 18C6 = 1140

So, the probability of getting case 1 is 20/1140 and the probability of getting case 2 is 960/1140.

Since the probability of getting case 1 is less than 0.5, and since the probabilities must sum to 1, it follows that the probability of getting case 2 is greater than 0.5. Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer:
{case: 2, 1}
