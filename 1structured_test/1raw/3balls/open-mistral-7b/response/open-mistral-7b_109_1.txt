To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) ways, where 6! is the total number of ways to arrange 6 objects, and 2! is the number of ways to arrange 2 objects.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) ways.

Now let's calculate the probability of each case:

Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways to distribute the balls
                                 = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) /((6!)/(3! * 3! * 1!))
                                 = (3! * 3! * 1!) / (3! * 3! * 1!)
                                 = 1

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways to distribute the balls
                                 = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) /((6!)/(3! * 3! * 1!))
                                 = 3! * 1! / 3! * 1!
                                 = 3

Since the probability of Case 1 is 1 and the probability of Case 2 is 3, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This means that, on average, you would see 3 times more instances of Case 2 than Case 1, but since we are talking about probabilities, it is still possible to get more instances of Case 1 in a specific set of many rounds.
