To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then determine which one occurs more frequently.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This distribution can be achieved in 3! (factorial) ways since the order of distribution among the children does not matter. The calculation is as follows:

Number of ways for Case 1 = 3! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
                                     = 6 / (2 * 2 * 2)
                                     = 1

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This distribution can also be achieved in 3! ways, but since there are more balls for child B, we need to consider the possible order of the excess ball for child B:

Number of ways for excess ball position 1 = 3! / (2! * 1! * 1!)
Number of ways for excess ball position 2 = 3! / (1! * 2! * 1!)

Adding both ways for Case 2:
Number of ways for Case 2 = Number of ways for excess ball position 1 + Number of ways for excess ball position 2
                                     = (3! / (2! * 1! * 1!)) + (3! / (1! * 2! * 1!))
                                     = 6 + 6
                                     = 12

Now, we can compare the two cases:

For Case 1, there is only one way to distribute the balls.
For Case 2, there are 12 ways to distribute the balls.

Since there are more ways for Case 2 to occur than for Case 1, we can say that, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.

{case: 2}
