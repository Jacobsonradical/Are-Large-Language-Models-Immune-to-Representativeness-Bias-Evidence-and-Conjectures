To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then find the ratio of these two numbers. We will use stars and bars to count the number of ways to distribute the balls.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) can be represented as **** | ** | **. The '|' separates the balls among the three children, and the '*' represent places where the separators can be placed. The number of separators is 2, so there are 5 stars and 2 bars.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the number of ways to arrange 5 stars and 2 bars, which is given by the binomial coefficient C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 21.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) can be represented as **** | *** | *. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the number of ways to arrange 5 stars and 3 bars, which is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 56.

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to the number of ways for case 2:

Ratio = Number of ways for case 1 / Number of ways for case 2 = 21 / 56

Since the ratio is less than 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
