To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and determine which one has more possibilities.

There are 6! (720) ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without considering the order. However, since the distribution is identical for permutations of the same set of balls, we can divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 children (3!) to find the number of distinct distributions:

1. Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
   - Number of ways to arrange 3 children: 3! = 6
   - Number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child having 2 balls: (6 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) / 6 = 15 * 15 * 15 / 6 = 1050
   - Total number of distinct distributions for case 1: 1050 * 6 = 6300

2. Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
   - Number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with children A, B, and C having 2, 3, and 1 balls, respectively: (6 choose 2) * (6 choose 3) * (6 choose 1) = 15 * 120 * 6 = 10800
   - Total number of distinct distributions for case 2: 10800 * 1 = 10800

Comparing the total number of distinct distributions for both cases, we can see that case 2 has more possibilities (10800) than case 1 (6300).

{case: 2, 1}

The answer is that there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
