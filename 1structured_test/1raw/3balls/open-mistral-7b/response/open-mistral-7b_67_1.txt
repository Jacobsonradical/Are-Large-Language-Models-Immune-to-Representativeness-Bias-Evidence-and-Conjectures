To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be represented as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from a total of 6. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen.

So, for Case 1, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This can be represented as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from a total of 6.

So, for Case 2, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (6! / (1!(6-1)!)) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700 ways.

Comparing the two, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in Case 2 (2700) than in Case 1 (3375). However, since we're interested in finding out if there will be more results of one case or the other in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of getting a specific distribution in each round is the number of ways that distribution can occur divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls. The total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the sum of the ways for each case, which is 3375 + 2700 = 6075 ways.

So, the probability of getting a result of Case 1 is 3375/6075, and the probability of getting a result of Case 2 is 2700/6075. Since the probability of getting a result of Case 2 (0.4444) is greater than the probability of getting a result of Case 1 (0.5556), it's more likely that you'll see more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that, in the long run, you're more likely to see the distribution of balls as specified in Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
