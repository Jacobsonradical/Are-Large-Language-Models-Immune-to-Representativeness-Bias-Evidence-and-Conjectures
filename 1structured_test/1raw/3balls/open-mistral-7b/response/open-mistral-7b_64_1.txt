To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be achieved by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. This can be done in 6C2 ways for each child, and since all children are independent, we multiply these possibilities:

Number of ways for case 1 = 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we can choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. The number of ways to do this is:

Number of ways for case 2 = 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur than for case 2, it is more likely that the distribution will be case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that in the long run, you will see the distribution of balls as specified in case 1 more frequently than case 2.
