To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. There are 6! (720) ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. We need to count the number of ways to have 2 balls for each child. This can be done using combinations, C(6,2) for each child, which gives us 15 ways for each child. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 33,750 ways.

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. Again, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls to A and C is C(6,2) * C(4,1) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways. The number of ways to distribute 3 balls to B is C(6,3) = 20 ways. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 60 * 20 = 1200 ways.

Now, let's compare the probabilities of both cases:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways
                                   = 33,750 / 216,760
                                   ≈ 0.155

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways
                                   = 1200 / 216,760
                                   ≈ 0.0055

Since the probability of case 1 is much larger than the probability of case 2, we expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

This answer assumes that each distribution is equally likely, which could be the case if the children are randomly selecting balls without any bias. However, if the children have different preferences or strategies, the actual distribution may not follow these probabilities.
