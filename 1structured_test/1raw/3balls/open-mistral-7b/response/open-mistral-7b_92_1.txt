To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of Case 1 = [C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)] / [C(15,6)]
Probability of Case 2 = [C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)] / [C(15,6)]

Since the probabilities are equal for both cases, they will occur with the same frequency in the long run. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, probability is the same as case 2, 1}

However, it's important to note that in a finite number of rounds, the actual distribution may deviate from the expected probability due to the random nature of the distribution. For a large number of rounds, the actual distribution should approach the expected probability.
