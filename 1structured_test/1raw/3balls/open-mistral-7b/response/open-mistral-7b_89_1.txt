To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare those counts. We'll use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls.

In both cases, we have 6 balls to distribute among 3 children. The total number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and the remaining C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for C. Multiplying these counts gives us the total number of ways for case 1, which is (C(6, 2))^3 = 15^3 = 33,750.

Similarly, for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(6, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 ball for C. Multiplying these counts gives us the total number of ways for case 2, which is (C(6, 2)) * (C(6, 3)) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 27,300.

Now, let's compare the counts for both cases:

* Case 1: 33,750
* Case 2: 27,300

Since the number of ways for case 1 is greater than the number of ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, {case: 1, 1} is the answer.
