To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case and then compare them. We will use the concept of multinomial coefficients to calculate the number of ways.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to arrange 6 identical balls into 3 non-identical groups (A:2, B:2, C:2) is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for group A, 2 balls for group B, and 2 balls for group C.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups (A:2, B:3, C:1) is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 3, 1).

Now let's compute the multinomial coefficients for both cases:

Case 1: C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2: C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 30

It can be seen that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (30) than in case 1 (15).

{case: 2, 1}

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
