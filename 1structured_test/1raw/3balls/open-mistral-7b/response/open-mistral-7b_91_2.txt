To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n items into r non-empty boxes is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, S(n, r). However, in this case, the balls are distinguishable, so we can use the multinomial coefficient instead.

The multinomial coefficient C(n; a_1, a_2, ..., a_r) gives the number of ways to distribute n items into r non-empty boxes, where a_i represents the number of items in the i-th box. In this case, n = 6 (balls), r = 3 (children), and a_1 = 2, a_2 = 2, and a_3 = 2 for case 1, and a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3, and a_3 = 1 for case 2.

Using the multinomial coefficient, we can calculate the number of ways for each case:

case 1: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 180
case 2: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

In both cases, we get 180 as the number of ways to distribute the balls. Since both cases have the same number of occurrences, we cannot say that one case will occur more often than the other in the long run.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

However, it's important to note that in a finite number of rounds, one case might occur more often by chance. But in the infinitely long run, both cases should occur approximately the same number of times.
