In this question, we are asked to determine if there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game where 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children A, B, and C.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1:
- We need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
- So, the number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2:
- We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways.
- So, the number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120.

Now, let's compare the number of ways for both cases:
- In many rounds of the game, the probability of getting case 1 is the number of ways for case 1 divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls: 90/(15*6*1 + 15*4*2) = 90/960 = 1/10.
- Similarly, the probability of getting case 2 is the number of ways for case 2 divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls: 120/(15*6*1 + 15*4*2) = 120/960 = 2/15.

Since the probability of getting case 2 (2/15) is higher than the probability of getting case 1 (1/10), we can expect more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
