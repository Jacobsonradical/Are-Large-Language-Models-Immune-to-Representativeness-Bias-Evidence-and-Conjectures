To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We will use combinations to count the number of ways to distribute the balls.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(6, 2) ways for B, and the remaining C(6, 2) ways for C. Since the order does not matter, we multiply these counts:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 26,885 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(6, 3) ways for B, and C(6, 1) ways for C. Again, since the order does not matter, we multiply these counts:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 27,300 ways

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more ways for case 2 to occur (27,300) than for case 1 (26,885). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

In other words, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than of case 1.
