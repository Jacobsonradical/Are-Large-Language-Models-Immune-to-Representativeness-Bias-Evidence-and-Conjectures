To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into three groups (A, B, C) with specific numbers of balls in each group. This is a multinomial coefficient problem.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 42 * 2 = 2520 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Answer: {2, 1}
