To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

There are a total of C(18, 6) ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children. In case 1, there are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = 720.

Similarly, in case 2, there are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(6, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) = 1260.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, we expect to see more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case 2, 1}
