To answer this question, we need to understand the number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children in each case, and then calculate the probability of each case occurring.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in a group. Here, n = 6 and k = 2 for each group, so there are C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case occurring. The total number of ways to distribute the balls in any case is given by C(6, 6) = 6! / (6!0!) = 720.

So, the probability of case 1 occurring is 3375 / 720, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 2700 / 720.

Since both probabilities are greater than 0 and less than 1, we can't say for sure which case will occur more often in the long run. However, to find out if one probability is greater than the other, we can compare their ratios:

3375 / 2700 = 5/4

This ratio is greater than 1, which means that, on average, case 1 will occur more often than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that, in the long run, we expect to see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
