To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in a specific way is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of items in each group.

For case 1: C(6; 2, 2, 2)
For case 2: C(6; 2, 3, 1)

Let's calculate these values:

Case 1: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 120 ways
Case 2: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 120 ways

Since the probability of each distribution is proportional to the number of ways it can occur, and both cases have the same number of ways, we cannot say with certainty that there will be more results of one case over the other in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}
