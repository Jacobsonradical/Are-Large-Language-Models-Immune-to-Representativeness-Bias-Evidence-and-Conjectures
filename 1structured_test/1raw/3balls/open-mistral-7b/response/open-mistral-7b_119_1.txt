To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then determine which case has more possibilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this case is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from a total of 6 balls. This can be calculated using combinations: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) * (2! / (2!(2-2)!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This time, we have to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. The number of ways to do that is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) * (2! / (1!(2-1)!)) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120 ways.

Now we can compare the number of ways for each case:

- Case 1: 90 ways
- Case 2: 120 ways

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has more results than Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.

Final answer: {case: 2, 1}
This means that in more rounds of the game, you will see more results of case 2 than case 1.
