To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be done in 6! (factorial of 6) ways, as the order doesn't matter. However, since there are 3 identical groups of 2 balls, we need to divide by the number of ways to choose 3 groups out of 3, which is 3C3 = 1. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 6! / (3C3) = 20 ways.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be done in 6! ways. But now, there are 2 groups of 2 balls and 1 group of 1 ball, so we need to divide by the number of ways to choose 2 groups out of 3, which is 3C2 = 3. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 6! / (3C2) = 30 ways.

Comparing the two cases, there are more results of case 2 (30) than case 1 (20).

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times more frequent: 15}
