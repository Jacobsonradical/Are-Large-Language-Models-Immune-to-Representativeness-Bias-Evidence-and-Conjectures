To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. So the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) / C(9,6)

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways. So the probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) / C(9,6)

Now, let's calculate these probabilities:

P(case 1) = 15 * 6 * 1 / 84 = 90 / 84 = 1
P(case 2) = 15 * 4 * 2 / 84 = 60 / 84 = 0.75

Since the probability of case 1 is 1 (meaning it will definitely occur), and the probability of case 2 is less than 1, we can say that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
