To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient C(n+k-1, k-1, k-1, ..., 1) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of groups. In this case, n = 6 and k = 3.

For case 1, we have 3 sets of 2 balls each, which can be arranged in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways. The total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 1!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2, we have 2 sets of 2 balls and 1 set of 1 ball, which can be arranged in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(1, 1) ways. The total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (1! / (1! * 1!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Since both cases have the same number of ways to occur, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}

However, this answer might not hold if we consider the order of distribution, as the two cases are indistinguishable if we don't consider the order. To account for the order, we would need to consider permutations, which is a more complex problem. In this case, without considering the order, we can conclude that there will be an equal number of results for both cases.
