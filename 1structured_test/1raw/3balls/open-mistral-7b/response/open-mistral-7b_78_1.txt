To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This is equivalent to arranging 6 objects (balls) in 3 distinct groups of 2, 2, and 2. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 120 ways.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This is equivalent to arranging 6 objects in 3 distinct groups of 2, 3, and 1. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180 ways.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we can expect to see more results of this case in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that in the long run, you are more likely to see the distribution with 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C than the distribution with an equal number of balls for each child.
