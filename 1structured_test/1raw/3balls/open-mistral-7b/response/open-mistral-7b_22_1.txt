To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways case 1 can occur. We can distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2, 2, and 2 in 3! (3 factorial) ways (since the order does not matter):

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

Now, let's calculate the number of ways case 2 can occur. We can distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2, 3, and 1 in 2! * 3! ways (since the order does not matter for the first two groups, and the order of the last group does not matter):

2! * 3! = (2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1) = 12

Now, let's compare the number of ways each case can occur:

case 1: 6
case 2: 12

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Final answer: {case: 2}
