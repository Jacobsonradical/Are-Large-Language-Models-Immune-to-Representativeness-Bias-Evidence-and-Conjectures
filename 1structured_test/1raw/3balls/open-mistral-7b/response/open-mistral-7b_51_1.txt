To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 3! (factorial) ways because the order in which the balls are given to each child does not matter. So, the number of ways for case 1 is 3! = 6.

Next, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) ways, where C(n,r) is the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items. The first C(6,2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6, the second C(4,3) represents the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4, and the last C(1,1) represents the number of ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1. So, the number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Now, comparing the number of ways for case 1 (6) and case 2 (60), it is clear that there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 is not the correct answer}
