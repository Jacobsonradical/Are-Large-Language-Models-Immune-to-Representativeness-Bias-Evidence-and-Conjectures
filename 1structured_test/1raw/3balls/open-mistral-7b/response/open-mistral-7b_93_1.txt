To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(9, 3), where n is the total number of balls (6) and r is the number of children (3).

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This can be done using the combination formula for three separate sets: C(6, 2) for A's balls, C(4, 2) for B's balls, and C(2, 2) for C's balls. Multiplying these together gives us the total number of ways for case 1:

Total ways for case 1 = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
                                     = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) * (2! / (2!(2-2)!))
                                     = (720 / (2*24)) * (24 / (2*2)) * (2)
                                     = 720 * 2 * 1
                                     = 1440

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This can be done similarly, but we need to consider that A and B have 4 balls between them, which can be distributed in C(6, 4) ways:

Total ways for case 2 = C(6, 4) * C(3, 3) * C(1, 1)
                                     = (6! / (4!(6-4)!)) * (3! / (3!(3-3)!)) * (1!)
                                     = (15,120 / (4*24)) * (6 / (3*1)) * (1)
                                     = (15,120 * 2) / 24
                                     = 300

Since there are an infinite number of rounds in the game, we can say that the probability of getting case 1 or case 2 in a single round is the number of ways for that case divided by the total number of ways. The expected number of times each case occurs over an infinite number of rounds is the probability of that case times one.

So to find out which case occurs more frequently, we simply compare the expected number of times each case occurs:

Expected times for case 1 = (1440) / (C(9, 3))
                                     = 1440 / 84
                                     ≈ 17.05

Expected times for case 2 = (300) / (C(9, 3))
                                     = 300 / 84
                                     ≈ 3.57

Since the expected number of times case 1 occurs is approximately 17.05, and the expected number of times case 2 occurs is approximately 3.57, we can say that case 1 is more likely to occur than case 2 in the long run.

Answer: {case 1, 1}
