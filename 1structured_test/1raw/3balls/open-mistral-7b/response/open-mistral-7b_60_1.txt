To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be achieved in 3! (3 factorial) ways since the order of distribution does not matter (AABBCC, AABBCC, AABCC, ABBCCA, ABBCCA, ABBCCA, etc.). 3! equals 6.

In case 2, there are more ways to distribute the balls. The distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 can occur in 2! (2 factorial) ways for children A and C (AA, AC) and 3! ways for children B (BBB). Multiplying these results gives us 2 * 6 = 12 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more outcomes for case 2 (12) than for case 1 (6).

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
