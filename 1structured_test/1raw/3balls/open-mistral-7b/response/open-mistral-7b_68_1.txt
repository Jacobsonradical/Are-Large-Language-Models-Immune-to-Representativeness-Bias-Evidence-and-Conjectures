To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls into the three children's sets according to each case, and then compare these counts.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for A
C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose 2 balls for B
C(2,2) = 1 way to choose 2 balls for C

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we have C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways:

C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls for A
C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose 3 balls for B
C(2,1) = 2 ways to choose 1 ball for C

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 * 2 = 120 ways.

Comparing the two numbers, the distribution with 3 balls for child B (case 2) has more possible outcomes than the distribution with 2 balls for each child (case 1). Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2, 1}

This means that, in more rounds of the game, we will observe the distribution of balls as in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
