To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are three children, and each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(n; r1, r2, r3) = n! / (r1! * r2! * r3!), where n is the total number of balls and r1, r2, r3 are the number of balls for children A, B, and C, respectively.

In this case, n = 6, r1 = 2, r2 = 2, and r3 = 2.

So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 ways.

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (20 ways) than in case 1 (15 ways).

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, the result of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is more likely to occur than the result of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
