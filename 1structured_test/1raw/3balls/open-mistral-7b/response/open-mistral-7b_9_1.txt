To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child getting 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with the given distribution is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 42 * 2 = 2520

Now, to find the probability of each case, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes. The total possible outcomes for each round is C(6, 6) = 6! / (6-6)! = 720.

For case 1, the probability is 90/720 = 1/8
For case 2, the probability is 2520/720 = 5/3

Since the probability of case 2 (5/3) is greater than the probability of case 1 (1/8), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in the long run, the probability of observing the distribution of balls as in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of observing the distribution as in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
