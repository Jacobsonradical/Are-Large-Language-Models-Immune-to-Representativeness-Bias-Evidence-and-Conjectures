To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be achieved in 3! (3 factorial) ways because the order in which the balls are distributed among the children does not matter. So, there are 3! ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C.

To calculate 3!, we multiply 3 by 2, then by 1: 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.

In case 2, there are more ways to distribute the balls because C gets only 1 ball. So, there are 2! ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 2 balls to B, and then 1 way to distribute the remaining ball to C.

To calculate 2!, we multiply 2 by 1: 2! = 2 * 1 = 2 ways.

Now, we multiply the number of ways for case 2 by the number of ways C can get the last ball: 2 * 1 = 2 ways.

So, there are a total of 6 * 2 = 12 ways to achieve case 2.

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, we see that there are more ways to get the result of case 2 (12 ways) than the result of case 1 (6 ways).

Therefore, {case: 2, 1} indicates that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
