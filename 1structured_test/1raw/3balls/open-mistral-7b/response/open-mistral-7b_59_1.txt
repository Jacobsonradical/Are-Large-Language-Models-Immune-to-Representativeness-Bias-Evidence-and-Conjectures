To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution (case 1 and case 2) can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls among the children is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in 6! (factorial of 6) ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C, and then arranging them within each group. However, since the order of balls within each group does not matter, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 2 balls, which is 2! for each group. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

(6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 720 / 8 = 90 ways

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in 6! ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C, but now we divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 balls in B's group (3!) and the number of ways to arrange the single ball with C (1!). So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

(6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60 ways

Now, to find out which case occurs more often, we simply compare the number of ways for each case. In this case, case 1 occurs more often than case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1,  number of occurrences: more frequent}
