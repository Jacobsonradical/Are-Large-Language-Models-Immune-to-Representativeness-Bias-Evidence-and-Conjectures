To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be done in 3! (3 factorial) ways, as the order of distribution does not matter. The formula for 3! is 3*2*1 = 6.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This can be done in 3! ways as well, but we need to consider that there are more ways to distribute 3 balls to B and 1 ball to C than the other way around. So, we have 2*2*1 ways to distribute 3 to B and 1 to C, and 3*2*1 ways to distribute 3 to C and 1 to B. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 2*2*1 + 3*2*1 = 12.

Now, let's compare the number of ways for both cases:

1. Case 1: 6 ways
2. Case 2: 12 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2, 1 is less frequent}
