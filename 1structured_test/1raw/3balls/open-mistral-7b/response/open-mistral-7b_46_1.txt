To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case happening and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child getting 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with the given distribution is given by:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case happening in a round of the game:

P(case 1) = C(6, 2, 2, 2) / C(6, 6) = (6! * 2! * 2! * 2!) / (6! * 1!) = 1/6

P(case 2) = C(6, 2, 3, 1) / C(6, 6) = (6! * 2! * 3! * 1!) / (6! * 1!) = 1/12

Since each case has an equal chance of happening in a single round, we can't say which case will occur more frequently in a single round. However, if we consider many rounds of the game, we can expect more results of case 1 because the probability of case 1 is higher:

P(case 1 occurs in n rounds) = (P(case 1))^n

P(case 2 occurs in n rounds) = (P(case 2))^n

Since P(case 1) > P(case 2), we can expect more results of case 1 in the long run.

{case: 1, 1}

In conclusion, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
