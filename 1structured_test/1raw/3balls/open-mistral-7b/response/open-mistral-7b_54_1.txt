To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways.
C(6,2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of 6, which is 15.
C(4,2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of 4 (remaining balls for A), which is 6.
C(2,2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of 2 (remaining balls for C), which is 1.
So, the total number of ways to achieve case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways.
C(6,2) is the same as in case 1.
C(4,3) represents the number of ways to choose 3 balls from a set of 4, which is 4.
C(2,1) represents the number of ways to choose 1 ball from a set of 2, which is 2.
So, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is 15 * 4 * 2 = 120.

Now, let's compare the probabilities of both cases. The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of case 1 is 90/total_outcomes and the probability of case 2 is 120/total_outcomes.

Since the total number of possible outcomes is the same for both cases (C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120), the probabilities can be directly compared. The probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 indicates case 1, 2 indicates case 2}
