To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways (where C(n,r) represents the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items).

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) ways.

Since both cases have the same number of ways to achieve A:2 distribution, we can compare the number of ways for B:2,B:3, and C:2,C:1 distributions.

The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 2 balls to B is less than the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 3 balls to B, as the latter has more possibilities for distribution. Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 2 balls to C is less than the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 1 ball to C.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring is greater than the probability of case 1 occurring.

However, without specific information about the number of rounds in the game, we cannot definitively say that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 over many rounds.
