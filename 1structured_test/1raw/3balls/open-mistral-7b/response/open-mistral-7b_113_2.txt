To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in 6! (factorial of 6) ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C, without considering the order. However, since the order does not matter, we can divide this number by the number of ways to arrange 6 objects in 3 sets of 2, which is 3! (factorial of 3). So, the number of ways for case 1 is (6! / (3! * 2!)).

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. Again, this can occur in 6! ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. However, the order does not matter, so we divide by the number of ways to arrange 6 objects in 3 sets, which is 3!. So, the number of ways for case 2 is (6! / 3!).

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to the number of ways for case 2:

(6! / (3! * 2!)) / (6! / 3!) = (2 * 3!) / (3!) = 2 * 6 = 12

Since the number of ways for each case is a multiple of the number of ways for case 2, there will be an equal number of results for both cases in the long run. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}

However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical answer based on the assumption that each distribution is equally likely in a large number of rounds, which might not necessarily be the case in a real-world scenario.
