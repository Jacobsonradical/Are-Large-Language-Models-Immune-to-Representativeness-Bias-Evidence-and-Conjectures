To answer this question, we'll use combinatorics. In both cases, we have 6 balls to distribute among three children. Let's first find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is equivalent to distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 balls each. This can be done in C(6,3) ways, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which is given by the formula C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

So, for case 1, the number of ways is C(6,3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This is equivalent to distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2, 3, and 1 ball each. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) ways, where C(4,3) is the number of combinations of 4 items taken 3 at a time.

So, for case 2, the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (3!(4-3)!)) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Now, to find out which case has more results, we simply compare the number of ways for each case:

- Case 1: 20 ways
- Case 2: 60 ways

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we expect to see more results of this case in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case 2, 1}
