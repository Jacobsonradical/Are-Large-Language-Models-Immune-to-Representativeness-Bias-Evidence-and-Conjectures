To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and determine which one has a higher probability.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a combination problem with repetition allowed (since the balls are distinguishable). The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2), the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is C(6,2), and the number of ways to choose 2 balls for C is also C(6,2). To find the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1, we multiply these three values:

C(6,2) * C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This is also a combination problem, but with repetition allowed. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2), the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is C(6,3), and the number of ways to choose 1 ball for C is C(6,1). To find the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we multiply these three values:

C(6,2) * C(6,3) * C(6,1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 900

Now, we can compare the number of ways for each case:

* Case 1: 3375 ways
* Case 2: 900 ways

Since the game is repeated many times, and the probability of an event is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, the probability of observing case 1 in a single round is 3375/7200 (since 7200 is the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without repetition), which simplifies to 11/24.

Since the probability of observing case 1 is greater than 1/2, we expect that, in the long run, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1, 1}
