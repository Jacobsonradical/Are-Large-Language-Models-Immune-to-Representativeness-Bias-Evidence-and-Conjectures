To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to distribute the balls among the children, which is 6 ways (since A, B, and C can be permuted in 6 different orders).

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3! ways to distribute the balls to children A and C, and 3! ways to distribute the balls to children B, A, and C in that order. So, there are 2 * 3! = 18 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Now, to find out which case is more likely, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes (ways to distribute the balls in each case) by the total number of possible outcomes (total ways to distribute the balls among the three children).

The total number of ways to distribute the balls among the three children is 6! (6 factorial), which is equivalent to C(6, 3) = 20 (since there are 6 balls and 3 children).

So, the probability of case 1 is 6/20 = 0.3, and the probability of case 2 is 18/20 = 0.9.

Since the probability of case 2 (0.9) is greater than the probability of case 1 (0.3), it is more likely that the balls will be distributed according to case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 would occur less frequently}
