To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways for each case.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) can be achieved in the following ways:
1. Choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C from the 6 balls in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 720 ways.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) can be achieved in the following ways:
1. Choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C from the 6 balls in 6C2 * C(6,3) * 6C1 = 1440 ways.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we would expect to see more results of this case in many rounds of the game.
