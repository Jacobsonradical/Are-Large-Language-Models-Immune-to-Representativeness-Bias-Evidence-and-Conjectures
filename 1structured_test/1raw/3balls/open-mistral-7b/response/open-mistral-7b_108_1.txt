To answer this question, we need to find the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among A, B, and C in each case and then compare them. We will use the concept of multinomial coefficients for this.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are C(6, 2) ways to distribute 2 balls to A, C(6, 2) ways to distribute 2 balls to B, and C(6, 2) ways to distribute 2 balls to C. Using the multinomial coefficient formula, which is given by C(n, r_1, r_2, ..., r_k) = n! / (r_1! * r_2! * ... * r_k!), we can calculate the total number of ways as:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (2! * 4!))

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6, 2) ways to distribute 2 balls to A, C(6, 3) ways to distribute 3 balls to B, and C(6, 1) ways to distribute 1 ball to C. The total number of ways is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (6! / (1! * 5!))

Now, let's compare the two total numbers:

(6! / (2! * 4!))^3 = (720^3) / (2^3 * 24^3) = 2,304,000

(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = (720) * (6) * (6) = 21,600

As you can see, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is much larger than in case 2.

{case: 1, 1}

The answer is that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game. This is because the distribution in case 1 (2 balls to each child) has more possible arrangements than case 2 (2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C).
