To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the distribution of balls can be achieved in 6! (factorial of 6) ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C in any order. However, since the order does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 identical sets of 2 balls each, which is 3!. So, the number of ways for case 1 is (6! / (3! * 3!)).

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the distribution can be achieved in 6! ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. Again, since the order does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 sets of balls with different numbers, which is 3! * 2!. So, the number of ways for case 2 is (6! / (3! * 2!)).

Now, let's compare the two cases:

The probability of case 1 occurring is the number of ways it can occur divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls, which is the sum of the number of ways for both cases. So, the probability of case 1 is (number of ways for case 1) / (number of ways for case 1 + number of ways for case 2).

Using the calculations above, we find that the probability of case 1 is approximately 0.289 and the probability of case 2 is approximately 0.711. Since the sum of the probabilities for both cases is 1, it means that in the long run, we would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in the long run, there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
