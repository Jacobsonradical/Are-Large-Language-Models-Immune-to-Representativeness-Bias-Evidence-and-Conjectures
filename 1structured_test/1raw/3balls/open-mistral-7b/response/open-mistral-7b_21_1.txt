To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the balls can be distributed in 3! (3 factorial) ways: A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved by choosing 2 balls for child A from 6, 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4, and 2 balls for child C from the remaining 2. This can be calculated as C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

In case 2, the balls can be distributed in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is the sum of the ways in case 1 and case 2, which is 90 + 60 = 150 ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

The probability of case 1 is the number of ways it can happen divided by the total number of ways, which is 90/150.

The probability of case 2 is the number of ways it can happen divided by the total number of ways, which is 60/150.

Since both probabilities are less than 1, we can compare them directly. We can see that the probability of case 1 (90/150) is greater than the probability of case 2 (60/150).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that in the long run, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
