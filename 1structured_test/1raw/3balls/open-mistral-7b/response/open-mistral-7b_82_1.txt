To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3 choices for the first child (A), then 3 choices for the second child (B), and finally 3 choices for the third child (C). So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 3C1 * 3C1 * 3C1 = 27.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3 choices for the first child (A), then 4 choices for the second child (B), and finally 3 choices for the third child (C). So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 3C1 * 4C2 * 3C1 = 72.

Since there are more ways for case 2 (72) than for case 1 (27), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in the long run, you're more likely to see the distribution of balls as in case 2 than in case 1.
