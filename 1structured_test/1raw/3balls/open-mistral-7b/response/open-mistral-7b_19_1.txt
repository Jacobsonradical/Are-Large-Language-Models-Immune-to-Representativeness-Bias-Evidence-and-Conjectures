To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use the concept of multinomial coefficients, which count the number of ways to distribute a fixed number of items into multiple categories.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) = 56.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- Choose 2 balls for B: C(4, 2) = 6 ways
- Choose 2 balls for C: C(2, 2) = 1 way
- Multiply these choices to find the total number of ways for case 1: 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Similarly, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
- Choose 3 balls for B: C(4, 3) = 4 ways
- Choose 1 ball for C: C(2, 1) = 2 ways
- Multiply these choices to find the total number of ways for case 2: 15 × 4 × 2 = 240

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 (240) than case 1 (90), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This might seem counterintuitive, but it is the result of the combinatorics involved. In fact, as the number of balls increases, the difference between the two cases also increases.
