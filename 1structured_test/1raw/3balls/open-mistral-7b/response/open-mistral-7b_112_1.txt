To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of items (balls) and r is the number of children. In this case, n = 6 and r = 3.

1. For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) = 56 ways.

2. For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6+3-1, 3) = C(8, 3) times the number of ways to choose 1 ball from 6 for child C. This is given by C(6, 1) = 6 ways. Therefore, there are 56 * 6 = 336 ways for case 2.

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

- The total number of possible distributions is C(6+3-1, 3) = 56.
- The probability of case 1 is 56 ways of case 1 / 56 total ways = 1.
- The probability of case 2 is 336 ways of case 2 / 56 total ways = 6.

Since the probability of case 2 (6) is greater than the probability of case 1 (1), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1} is incorrect because it suggests that there will be more results of case 1, but based on our calculations, case 2 is more likely to occur. The correct answer is:
{case: 2, 2}
