To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we are distributing 6 balls among three children such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. This can be done using combinations. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for each child is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we are distributing 6 balls among three children such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since there are an infinite number of rounds, we want to find the ratio of the number of times case 1 occurs to the number of times case 2 occurs. This ratio is the number of ways case 1 can occur divided by the number of ways case 2 can occur, which is 3375 / 60 = 56.25.

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a round, we can't definitively say that there will be more results of one case over the other. Therefore, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

This answer might seem counter-intuitive, but it's due to the fact that we're looking at an infinite number of rounds, and the probabilities of each case occurring in a single round don't necessarily translate into the number of times each case occurs over an infinite number of rounds.
