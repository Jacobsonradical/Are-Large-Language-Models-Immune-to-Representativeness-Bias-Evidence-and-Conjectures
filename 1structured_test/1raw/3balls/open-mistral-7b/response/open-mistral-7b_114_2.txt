To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to find the number of ways to distribute the balls.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6! (factorial of 6) ways to arrange the balls, but we need to divide by 3! (factorial of 3) because the arrangement of balls within each group does not matter. So, the number of ways for Case 1 is 6! / (3! * 2!) = 720 / (6 * 2) = 36 ways.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6! ways to arrange the balls, but we need to divide by 2! and 3! because the arrangement of balls within each group does not matter. So, the number of ways for Case 2 is 6! / (2! * 3!) = 720 / (2 * 6) = 60 ways.

Since there are more ways for Case 2 to occur than for Case 1 (60 > 36), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of occurrences}
