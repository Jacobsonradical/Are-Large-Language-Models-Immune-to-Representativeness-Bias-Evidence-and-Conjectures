To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the balls among the children, which equals 6 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3! ways to arrange the balls among the children for A and C, but for B, there are 4 choices for the 3rd ball (since one ball is already placed). So, the number of ways for case 2 is (3! * 4) = 24 ways.

Comparing the two, case 2 has more possible outcomes (24) than case 1 (6).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
