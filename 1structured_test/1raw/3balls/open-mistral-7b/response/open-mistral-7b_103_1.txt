To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and compare them.

In case 1, there are 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 2 balls to B, which is C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 = 225. Then, there are also 3 ways to distribute the remaining 2 balls to C, so there are 225 * C(6,2) = 225 * 15 = 3375 possible distributions for case 1.

In case 2, there are 3 ways to distribute 2 balls to A and 3 balls to B, which is C(6,2) * C(6,3) = 15 * 20 = 300. Then, there is 1 way to distribute the remaining 1 ball to C, so there are 300 * C(6,1) = 300 * 6 = 1800 possible distributions for case 2.

So, the probability of case 1 is 225 * 15 / (225 * 15 + 300 * 6) = 225 * 15 / 9900 ≈ 0.0226 or 2.26%

The probability of case 2 is 300 * 6 / (225 * 15 + 300 * 6) = 300 * 6 / 9900 ≈ 0.0303 or 3.03%

Since both probabilities are relatively small, we cannot say with certainty that one case is more likely than the other. However, if we were to make a guess based on these probabilities, we might lean slightly towards case 1 being more likely, but it is still a very close call.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: neither, 0}

However, to answer the question in the required format, we can say:
{case: 1, 1}

This is because, based on the probabilities, case 1 has a slightly higher probability of occurring, but it is not a significant enough difference to make a definitive statement. So, we can consider both cases to be equally likely and assign a probability of 1 to each.
