To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to find the probabilities for both scenarios and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This means that the distribution of balls is uniform among the children. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child getting 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n = 6 (total balls) and r = 2 (balls per child). So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This means that there are more balls for child B than for children A and C combined. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with this distribution is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(0, 1) = 15 * 44 * 1 = 660.

Now, let's compare the probabilities for both cases:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways to distribute in case 1 / Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children
                                     = 90 / (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) + C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(0, 1))
                                     ≈ 90 / (455 * 1 + 660)
                                     ≈ 90 / 1115

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways to distribute in case 2 / Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children
                                     = 660 / (C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) + C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(0, 1))
                                     ≈ 660 / 1115

Since the probabilities for both cases are approximately equal, it is not possible to say with certainty that one case will occur more frequently than the other in many rounds of the game.

However, if we want to make an educated guess based on the probabilities, we can see that the probability of case 2 is slightly higher (approximately 1.5 times higher), which suggests that case 2 may occur more often than case 1 in many rounds.

{case: 2, 1 or 2}

Note that this is just an approximation, and the actual results may vary depending on the specific sequence of rounds in the game.
