To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and determine which one has more possibilities.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C from a total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 1296 ways.

In case 2, the distribution of balls is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from a total of 6 balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 2016 ways.

So, there are more results of case 2 (2016) than case 1 (1296) in the game.

Answer: {case: 2, 1}

This means that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 (where child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball) than case 1 (where each child gets 2 balls).
