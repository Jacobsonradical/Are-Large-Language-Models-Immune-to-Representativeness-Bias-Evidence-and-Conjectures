To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children so that each child gets at least 1 ball. This ensures that there are always three valid distributions (one for each case). The number of ways to do this is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, S(6, 3), which can be computed using the formula S(n, k) = 1/k! * sum from i=0 to k-1 of (-1)^i * (k choose i) * (n-i)!^k.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2!^2 * 2!^2 * 2!) = 15.

case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2!^2 * 3! * 1!) = 15.

Since there are always 3 valid distributions and both cases have 15 ways to distribute the balls, there will be an equal number of results for case 1 and case 2 in the long run.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 2,  equal number of times}
