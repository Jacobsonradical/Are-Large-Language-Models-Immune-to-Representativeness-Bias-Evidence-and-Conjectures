To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This distribution can be achieved in 6!/(2!2!2!) ways, where 6! is the total number of arrangements of 6 balls, and 2! is the number of arrangements of 2 balls in each group.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This distribution can be achieved in 6!/(2!3!1!) ways, similarly to case 1.

Now, let's find the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to the number of ways for case 2:

(6!/(2!2!2!)) / (6!/(2!3!1!))

Using the formula for factorials, we can simplify this to:

(15) / (2)

So, the number of ways for case 1 is 15 times the number of ways for case 2. Since there are more ways for case 1, we can expect to see more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
