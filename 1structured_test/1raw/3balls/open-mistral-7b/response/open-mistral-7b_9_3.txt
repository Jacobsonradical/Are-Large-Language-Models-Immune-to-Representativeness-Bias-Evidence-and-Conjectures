To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare those numbers. We will use combinatorics for this calculation.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls from a set of 6 for child A, 2 balls for child B, and 2 balls for child C.

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
                     = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2)
                     = 15

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by C(6, 2, 3, 1), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
                     = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1)
                     = 60

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (60) than for case 1 (15), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
