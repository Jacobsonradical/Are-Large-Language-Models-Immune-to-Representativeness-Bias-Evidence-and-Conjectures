To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to distribute the balls among the three children, as the order does not matter. This is because we can think of it as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and the remaining 2 for C. So, the number of ways for case 1 is 3! = 6.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3! ways to distribute the 2 balls to A and B, and then only 1 way to give the remaining ball to C. However, there are 2! ways to distribute the 3 balls to B, so we need to account for both possibilities: B gets 2 balls first, or B gets 1 ball first. Therefore, the number of ways for case 2 is 3! * 2! + 3! = 6 * 2 + 6 = 24.

Comparing the two, we see that there are more ways for case 2 to occur (24) than for case 1 (6). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, we are more likely to see the distribution of balls as described in case 2 than in case 1.
