To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them. We will use the stars-and-bars method, which is a combinatorics technique for counting arrangements.

1. In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have three groups with 2, 2, and 2 balls respectively. The total number of balls is 6, and we need to place 3 dividers between these 6 items. Using the stars-and-bars method, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the following formula:

   C(n + k - 1, k - 1) = number of distributions

   where n is the total number of items (balls), k is the number of groups, and C(n, k) represents the binomial coefficient.

   So, for case 1, C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28 ways.

2. In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have three groups with 2, 3, and 1 balls respectively. Again, using the stars-and-bars method, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by:

   C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28 ways

Since case 1 and case 2 have the same number of ways to distribute the balls (28), there will be an equal number of results for both cases in many rounds of the game.

The final answer is:
{case: 1 and 2, 2}
