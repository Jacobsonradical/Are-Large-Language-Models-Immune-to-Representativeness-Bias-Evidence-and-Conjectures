To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This can be done using combinations: C(6,2) for each child, where C(n,r) is the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is: C(6,2) * C(6,2) * C(6,2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). We can use the same method:

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is: C(6,2) * C(6,3) * C(6,1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2730

Now, we can compare the number of ways for both cases to see which one occurs more frequently. In this case, there are more ways for the distribution in case 1 than in case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you are likely to see the distribution of balls as A:2, B:2, C:2 than A:2, B:3, C:1.
