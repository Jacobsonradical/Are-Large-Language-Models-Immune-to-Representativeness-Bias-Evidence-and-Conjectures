To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then determine which one has more possibilities.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is a combination problem with 6 items taken 3 at a time, which can be calculated using the formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

Here, n = 6 (total balls), k = 3 (number of children), and we want the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 to B, and 2 to C. This can be done in two steps:

1. Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children without considering the distribution within each child. This can be calculated as C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 ways.
2. Now, since we know that each child gets 2 balls, we can distribute these 2 balls within each child in 6 different ways (since the order matters). So, the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls in the desired manner is 20 * 6^3 = 23040.

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This can be done in the same way as before, but we should note that this time, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:

1. Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children without considering the distribution within each child. This can be calculated as C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 ways.
2. Distribute the 2 balls to A in 6 ways, the 3 balls to B in C(6, 3) = 20 ways, and the 1 ball to C in 6 ways. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls in the desired manner is 20 * 6 * 6 = 7200.

Comparing the two cases, we find that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), as 7200 > 23040.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, the result will be closer to case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than to case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
