To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is equal among all three children: A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in 3! (factorial of 3) ways by permuting the children. So, the number of ways for case 1 is 3! = 6.

In case 2, the distribution is not equal, with A having 2 balls, B having 3, and C having 1. To find the number of ways this can occur, we need to consider how many ways we can give 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C without considering the order (since the balls are distinguishable). This can be calculated using combinations: C(6, 2) (choosing 2 balls out of 6) for A, C(6, 3) (choosing 3 balls out of 6) for B, and C(6, 1) (choosing 1 ball out of 6) for C.

The total number of ways for case 2 is then C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (6! / (1! * 5!)) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800.

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways for case 2 to occur (1800) than for case 1 (6). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer assumes that the balls are distributed at random in each round, and that no ball is lost or added between rounds. If these assumptions are not accurate, the number of occurrences of each case may change.
