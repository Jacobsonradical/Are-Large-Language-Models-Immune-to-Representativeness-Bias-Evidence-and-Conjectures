To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in each case:

1. Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): This is a permutation of 6 items taken 3 at a time, with three sets of 2 items each. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items in each set. In this case, n = 6 and r = 2, so there are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to distribute the balls in this way.

2. Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): This is a permutation of 6 items taken 3 at a time, with two sets of 2 items and one set of 1 item. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 6 * 2 = 180 ways to distribute the balls in this way.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case. The probability of a particular distribution is the number of ways to achieve that distribution divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls among the children.

1. Case 1 probability: 15 ways / (total ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children) = 15 / C(6, 3) = 15 / 20 = 0.75

2. Case 2 probability: 180 ways / (total ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children) = 180 / C(6, 3) = 180 / 20 = 9

Since the probability of an event occurring multiple times is the square of the probability of the event occurring once, the expected number of times we would see Case 2 in many rounds is 9^2 = 81.

Since the expected number of times we would see Case 1 is 0.75 * total rounds, we can compare these expected numbers to determine which case is more likely to occur. However, since we do not know the total number of rounds, we cannot definitively say which case will occur more often.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: uncertain, 0}

This answer indicates that without more information, we cannot definitively say whether Case 1 or Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
