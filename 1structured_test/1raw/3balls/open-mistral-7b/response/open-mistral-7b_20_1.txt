To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We will use the concept of combinations to calculate the number of ways for each case.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 6 ways, because we can arrange the balls for A, B, and C in 6 different ways (AAABBB, AABBBC, AABBCB, AABCCA, ABACAB, ABACBA).

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) ways, where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. The total number of ways here is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, multiplied by the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 4 for B, which is (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = 15 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (15) than for case 1 (6), we can say that there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
