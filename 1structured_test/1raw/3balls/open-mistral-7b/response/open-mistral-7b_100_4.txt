To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them. In each round, there are 6 distinguishable balls to be distributed among three children.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we are looking for ways to arrange 3 groups of 2 balls each. This can be done using the combinations formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!))

Now, let's calculate this:

(720) * (720) * (720) = 362,880 ways

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have 3 groups with 2, 3, and 1 ball respectively. The number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (6! / (1!(6-1)!))

Now, let's calculate this:

(720) * (20) * 6 = 28,800 ways

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, we have:

362,880 (case 1) > 28,800 (case 2)

Since the number of ways for case 1 is greater than that of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}
