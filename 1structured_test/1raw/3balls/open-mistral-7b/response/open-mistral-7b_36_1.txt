To answer this question, we need to determine the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children in case 1:

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can think of it as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and then the remaining 2 for C. So, the number of ways for this case is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among the three children in case 2:

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can think of it as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and then the remaining 1 for C. So, the number of ways for this case is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Since the game is played multiple times, we want to find the ratio of the number of times case 1 occurs to the number of times case 2 occurs. So, the answer is:

{case: 90, case 2: 60}

To find the ratio, divide the number of times case 1 occurs by the number of times case 2 occurs:

Ratio = 90 / 60
= 3/2

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be 3/2 as many results of case 1 as there are of case 2.
