To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C from a set of 6 balls.

The multinomial coefficient C(n, r1, r2, ..., rk) is defined as:

C(n, r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of items in each group. In this case, n = 6, r1 = r2 = r3 = 2.

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)
= 15

Now let's consider case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 3, 1).

So, the number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
= (6 * 5) / (2 * 3)
= 20

Comparing the numbers of ways for both cases, we see that there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you are more likely to see the distribution of balls as in case 2 than in case 1.
