To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. Let's find the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in 6! (factorial of 6) ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C, and then arranging the balls within each group. However, since the order does not matter within each group, we can divide by the number of ways to arrange 2 balls (2!). So, the number of ways for Case 1 is:

Number of ways for Case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
                                         = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2)
                                         = 720 / 8
                                         = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be achieved in 6! ways by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C, and then arranging the balls within each group. Again, since the order does not matter within each group, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 2 balls for A and 3 balls for B. So, the number of ways for Case 2 is:

Number of ways for Case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
                                         = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1)
                                         = 720 / 12
                                         = 60

Now, let's compare the number of ways for both cases:

We have:
- Number of ways for Case 1 = 90
- Number of ways for Case 2 = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 to occur (90) than for Case 2 (60), we can say that there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1, 1}
