To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can distribute the 6 balls in 6!/3!3! = 20 ways (since we have 6 choices for the first ball for A, 5 choices for the second ball for A, and so on).

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can distribute the balls in 6!/2!3! = 30 ways (since we have 6 choices for the first ball for A, 5 choices for the second ball for A, 4 choices for the first ball for B, and so on).

There are more ways for the balls to be distributed in case 2 (30 ways) than in case 1 (20 ways). Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that, in the long run, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
