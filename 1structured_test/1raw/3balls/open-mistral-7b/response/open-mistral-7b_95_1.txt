To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each child gets at least 2 balls (case 1). This can be done by considering the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child from a total of 6 balls, which is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball (case 2). This can be done by choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from a total of 6 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has 90 ways and case 2 has 60 ways. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
