To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We will use the concept of permutations in combinatorics.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2, which means we are choosing 2 balls from a set of 6 for both children A and B, and then choosing the remaining 2 balls for child C. This can be calculated as:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 4060 ways

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1, which means we are choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. This can be calculated as:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2730 ways

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more ways for case 1 to occur (4060) than for case 2 (2730). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}
