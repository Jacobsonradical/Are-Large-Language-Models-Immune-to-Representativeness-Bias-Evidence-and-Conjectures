To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2, which means there are 6C3 ways to distribute the balls among the three children (6 choose 3 = 20).

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1, which means there are 6C2 ways to distribute 2 balls to A and B, and 6C1 way to distribute 1 ball to C (20 * 15 * 1 = 300).

Since there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in each round, and there are 2 possible outcomes (case 1 or case 2), the total number of rounds is 60 * 2 = 120.

The probability of case 1 is the number of ways to achieve this distribution divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls in a round:

P(case 1) = 20 / 60 = 1/3

The probability of case 2 is the number of ways to achieve this distribution divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls in a round:

P(case 2) = 300 / 60 = 5

Since the probability of an event occurring multiple times is the probability of the event multiplied by the number of trials, the expected number of times case 1 occurs is P(case 1) * 120 = (1/3) * 120 = 40.

Similarly, the expected number of times case 2 occurs is P(case 2) * 120 = 5 * 120 = 600.

Therefore, case 2 is expected to occur more times than case 1.

{case: 2, 1 or 2}

This answer indicates that, on average, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game. However, it's important to note that this is an expectation based on probability, and actual results may vary due to randomness.
