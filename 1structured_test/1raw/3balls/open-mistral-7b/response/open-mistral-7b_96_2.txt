To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be thought of as choosing 2 balls from a set of 6 for child A, then choosing another 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B, and finally choosing the remaining 2 balls for child C. This can be calculated using combinations (C(n, r)) as follows:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Similarly, for case 2, the distribution can be thought of as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B from the remaining 5, and 1 ball for C from the remaining 2.

C(6, 2) * C(5, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 10 * 2 = 300 ways

So, the probability of case 1 occurring is 90/total_ways and the probability of case 2 occurring is 300/total_ways.

Since the total number of ways to distribute the balls in each round is the sum of the ways in both cases, we have:

total_ways = 90 + 300 = 390

Now, if we compare the probabilities, we find that the probability of case 1 occurring is less than that of case 2:

P(case 1) = 90/390 = 1/4
P(case 2) = 300/390 â‰ˆ 0.7692

Since the probability of case 2 is greater than that of case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
