To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the Stirling number of the second kind (S(6,3)), which is 220.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6,2,2,2), which is (6!)/(2!2!2!2!) = 180.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6,2,3,1), which is (6!)/(2!3!1!) = 360.

So, the probability of case 1 occurring is 180/220 and the probability of case 2 occurring is 360/220.

Since the probabilities of both cases are positive, we cannot say definitively that one case will occur more often than the other in the long run. However, the probability of case 2 occurring is higher than that of case 1, so it is more likely that you will see more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that in the long run, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is expected to occur more frequently than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
