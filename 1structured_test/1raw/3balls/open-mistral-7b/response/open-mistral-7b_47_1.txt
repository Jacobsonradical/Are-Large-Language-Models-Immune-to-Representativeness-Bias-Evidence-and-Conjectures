To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n identical items into r non-identical groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n + r - 1, r - 1, n1, n2, ..., nr)

where n is the total number of items, r is the number of groups, and n1, n2, ..., nr are the number of items in each group.

In this case, we have n = 6 (balls), r = 3 (children), and n1 = 2, n2 = 2, and n3 = 2 for case 1, and n1 = 2, n2 = 3, and n3 = 1 for case 2.

Let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1:
C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1, 2, 2, 2) = C(8, 2, 2, 2)

Case 2:
C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1, 2, 3, 1) = C(8, 2, 3, 1)

Now, let's calculate the multinomial coefficients using the formula:

C(8, 2, 2, 2) = 8! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 5670

C(8, 2, 3, 1) = 8! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 2016

Since there are equally likely outcomes in each round, we can assume that the frequency of each case in many rounds will roughly correspond to the number of ways each case can occur. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

{case: 1, 1}

This means that in many rounds of the game, you will see more results of distributing the balls as A:2, B:2, C:2 than A:2, B:3, C:1.
