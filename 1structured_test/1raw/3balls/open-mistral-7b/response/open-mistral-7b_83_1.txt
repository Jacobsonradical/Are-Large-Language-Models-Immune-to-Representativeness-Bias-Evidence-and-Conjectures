To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without considering the order is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2) = 15
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is also C(6,2) = 15
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for C is also C(6,2) = 15
- So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 15 * 15 = 33,750

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2) = 15
- The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is C(6,3) = 20
- The number of ways to choose 1 ball for C is C(6,1) = 6
- So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 20 * 6 = 36,000

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (36,000) than for case 1 (33,750), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

{case: 2, 1 is less frequent}
