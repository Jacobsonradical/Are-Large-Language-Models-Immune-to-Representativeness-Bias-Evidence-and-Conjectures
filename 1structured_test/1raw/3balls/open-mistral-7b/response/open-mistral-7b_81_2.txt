To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare those numbers. We will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.
- So, the number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways.
- So, the number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (2! / (2! * 1!)) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 2 (120) to occur than for case 1 (90), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

{case: 2, 1 indicates less frequent, 2 indicates more frequent, 1 or 2}
