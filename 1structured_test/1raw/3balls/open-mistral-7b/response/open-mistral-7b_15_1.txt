To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (each getting 2 balls) is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items in each group.

In this case, n = 6 (balls) and r = 2 (balls per child). So, the number of ways for case 1 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15 ways.

For case 2, we have two groups with 2 and 3 balls, so the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = (15) * (4) = 60 ways.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game:
{case: 2, 1}

The reasoning behind this is that distributing the balls among three children in such a way that each child gets an equal number of balls (2 in this case) results in fewer possibilities than if one child gets more balls (3 in this case) while the other two get less (1 and 2 in this case).
