To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.
C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls from 6
C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose 2 balls from 4 remaining balls
C(2,2) = 1 way to choose 2 balls from 2 remaining balls
Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) ways
C(6,2) = 15 ways to choose 2 balls from 6
C(4,3) = 4 ways to choose 3 balls from 4 remaining balls
C(1,1) = 1 way to choose 1 ball from 1 remaining ball
Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90) than case 2 (60), we can conclude that there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
