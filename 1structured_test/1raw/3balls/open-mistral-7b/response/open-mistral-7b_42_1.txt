To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 6! (factorial of 6) ways, but since the order doesn't matter (it's a distribution), we divide by the factorial of the number of identical items in each case (which is 2 for each child). So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

C1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 6! ways, but since we have 3 different numbers of balls, we don't need to divide by factorials:

C2 = 6!

Now, let's compare the two:

C1 / C2 = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) / 6!

After simplifying the expression, we get:

C1 / C2 = 1 / 6

Since 1/6 is less than 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
