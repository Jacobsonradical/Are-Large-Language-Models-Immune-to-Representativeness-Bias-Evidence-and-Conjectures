To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. The probability of a particular distribution of balls between the three children is the number of ways to distribute the balls multiplied by the probability of choosing that distribution.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6! (720) ways to distribute the balls, and only one way that results in A having 2 balls, B having 2 balls, and C having 2 balls. So, the probability of case 1 is 1/720.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6! (720) ways to distribute the balls. However, there are 3 ways to distribute the balls to result in A having 2 balls, B having 3 balls, and C having 1 ball. So, the probability of case 2 is 3/720.

Since the number of favorable outcomes for case 1 is 1 and the number of favorable outcomes for case 2 is 3, and the probability of each case is calculated based on the total number of ways to distribute the balls, the overall probability of getting case 1 is less than the overall probability of getting case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times more likely}

This means that, in the long run, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is expected to occur more times than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
