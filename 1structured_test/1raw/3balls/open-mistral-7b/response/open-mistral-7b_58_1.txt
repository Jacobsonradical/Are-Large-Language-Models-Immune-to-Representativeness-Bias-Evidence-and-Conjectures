To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. We will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 1 (equally):

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children when each child gets 2 balls is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group.

So, for case 1, the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C as A:2, B:2, C:2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!))
                                      = (720) * (15) * (15)
                                      = 432,000

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in case 2 (not equally):

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C as A:2, B:3, C:1 is given by the stars-and-bars method:

There are 5 places where we can put the dividers, and we have 6 balls to distribute:

Number of ways = C(7, 5) * 6! / (5!(6-5)!)
                         = (7! / (5!(7-5)!)) * 6! / (5!(6-5)!)
                         = (5,040) * (720)
                         = 362,880

So, there are 432,000 ways for case 1 and 362,880 ways for case 2.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

The probability of each outcome is the number of ways it can occur divided by the total number of outcomes.

In this case, the total number of outcomes is the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, which is given by the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group.

So, the total number of outcomes is:

C(6, 3) = (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) = 20

The probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = 432,000 / 20 = 21,600

The probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = 362,880 / 20 = 18,144

Since the probability of case 1 is greater than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
