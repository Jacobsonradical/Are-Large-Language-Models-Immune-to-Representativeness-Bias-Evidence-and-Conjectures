To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 3! (6) ways to distribute the balls among the three children, since the order does not matter.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * 1 = 15 * 1 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways in case 1 / Total number of ways
                                 = 6 / (C(6,2) * 3!)
                                 = 6 / (15 * 6)
                                 = 1 / 5

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways in case 2 / Total number of ways
                                 = 15 / (C(6,2) * 3!)
                                 = 15 / (15 * 6)
                                 = 1 / 6

Since the number of rounds is large, we can expect the frequency of each case to be proportional to their probabilities. Therefore, in many rounds, we would expect to see more results of case 1 (which has a probability of 1/5) than of case 2 (which has a probability of 1/6).

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}
