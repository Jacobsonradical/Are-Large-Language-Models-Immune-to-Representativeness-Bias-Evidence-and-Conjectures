To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) ways, where 6! is the total number of permutations of 6 balls, and 2! is the number of permutations of 2 balls.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) ways.

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of Case 1 = (Number of ways in Case 1) / (Total number of ways to distribute the balls)
Total number of ways to distribute the balls = 6! / (3! * 1!) = 20

So, the probability of Case 1 is 20 / 20 = 1

Probability of Case 2 = (Number of ways in Case 2) / (Total number of ways to distribute the balls)

Calculate the number of ways in Case 2:
Number of ways in Case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 120

So, the probability of Case 2 is 120 / 20 = 6

Since the probability of Case 1 is 1 and the probability of Case 2 is 6, the number of rounds where Case 1 occurs is expected to be less than the number of rounds where Case 2 occurs.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
