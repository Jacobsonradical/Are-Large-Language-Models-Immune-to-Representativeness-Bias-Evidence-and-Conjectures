To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare the probabilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

This distribution can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. In this case, there are 6 balls, and we're choosing 2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C.

So, the number of ways for case 1 is: C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

This distribution can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways.

So, the number of ways for case 2 is: C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120 ways

Now, let's find the probability of each case:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways

Total number of ways to distribute the balls among the three children is the sum of the ways for both cases:

Total number of ways = Number of ways for case 1 + Number of ways for case 2
                            = 90 + 120
                            = 210 ways

So, the probability of case 1 is 90/210 = 1/2

Probability of case 2 = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways
                            = 120/210 = 2/3

Since the total number of ways is the same for both cases, the probability of getting case 1 is equal to the probability of getting case 2. Therefore, the game will result in case 1 and case 2 an equal number of times when played many times.

{case: 1, 2}

This answer indicates that, on average, the game will result in both cases the same number of times when played many times.
