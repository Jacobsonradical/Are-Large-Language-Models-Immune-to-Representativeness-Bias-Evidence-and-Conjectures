To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, we have three possibilities for distributing the 6 balls among the three children: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 720 ways.

In case 2, there are six ways to distribute 2 balls to A and B, and then one way to distribute the remaining 4 balls to C. So, the number of ways for case 2 is 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C1 = 720 * 6 = 4320 ways.

There are more occurrences of case 2 than case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, 1 is less frequent}
