To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

First, let's consider case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways (since choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 balls out of 4 for B, and 2 balls out of 2 for C is the same as distributing 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C). The probability of this case is:

P(case 1) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) / C(9, 6)

Now, let's consider case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) ways. The probability of this case is:

P(case 2) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) / C(9, 6)

Since the probabilities are the same for both cases, they will occur with equal frequency in the long run. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1 or 2, 1}

However, it's important to note that this is the theoretical probability. In practice, randomness might lead to more or fewer occurrences of each case than what the probability suggests.
