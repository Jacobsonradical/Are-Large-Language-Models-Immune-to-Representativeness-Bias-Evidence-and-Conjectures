To answer this question, we need to find out the probability of each case and then compare them.

In each round, the distribution of balls can be thought of as choosing 6 items from a set of 9 (0 through 8) without replacement, where the first three items represent the balls given to child A, the next three represent those given to child B, and the last one represents those given to child C.

There are a total of C(9, 6) = 84 ways to distribute the balls.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to find C(9, 6) ways where we have exactly 2 items less than 6 in the first three choices (representing A's balls), exactly 2 items less than 6 in the next three choices (representing B's balls), and exactly 2 items less than 6 in the last three choices (representing C's balls). This can be calculated as:

C(6, 2) * C(3, 2) * C(3, 2) = 15 * 3 * 3 = 135

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to find C(9, 6) ways where we have exactly 2 items less than 6 in the first three choices, exactly 3 items less than 6 in the next three choices, and exactly 1 item less than 6 in the last three choices. This can be calculated as:

C(6, 2) * C(3, 3) * C(3, 1) = 15 * 1 * 3 = 45

Now, we compare the probabilities of both cases:

P(case 1) = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways = 135 / 84
P(case 2) = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways = 45 / 84

Since P(case 1) > P(case 2), we can say that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
