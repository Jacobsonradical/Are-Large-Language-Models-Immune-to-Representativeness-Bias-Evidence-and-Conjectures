To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be thought of as choosing 2 balls for each child without regard to order (since the balls are indistinguishable), which is a combination problem. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in such a way that each child gets 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group.

So, for case 1, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

In case 2, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur than for case 2 to occur, we can expect more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
