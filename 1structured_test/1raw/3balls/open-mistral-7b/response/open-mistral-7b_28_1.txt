To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children in each case:

1. Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 3C2 * 3C2 * 3C2 = 288 ways.
2. Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 3C2 * 3C3 * 3C1 = 162 ways.

Now, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children without any restrictions. This can be done in 3C6 = 720 ways.

The probability of case 1 is the number of ways to achieve case 1 divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls, which is 288/720 = 1/3.

The probability of case 2 is the number of ways to achieve case 2 divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls, which is 162/720 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 (1/3) is greater than the probability of case 2 (1/4), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 1, 1}

This answer means that in more than half of the rounds, the balls will be distributed according to case 1.
