To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them. In each round, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to do this is given by the combinations formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items taken at a time. So, for case 1, we have n = 6 and r = 2 for all three children, so the number of ways this can occur is C(6, 2)^3 = 1296.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to do this is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (1296) * (48) * 1 = 633,600.

There are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1, so we can say that {case: 2, 1} is not the correct answer. The correct answer is {case: 2, 2}.

However, this answer assumes that the game is played an infinite number of times. If we're interested in the number of times each case will occur in a finite number of games, that would require additional information, such as the total number of games being played.
