To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. We will use the concept of stars and bars to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls.

In both cases, there are 6 balls and 3 children. The stars represent the balls, and the bars separate the balls given to each child.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be represented as ****|**|**|, where the first 4 stars represent the balls for A, the next bar separates them, and the last 2 stars represent the balls for C. Now, we have 2 stars and 2 bars left for B. We can distribute these using the stars and bars method, which gives us C(5,2) = 10 ways to distribute the 2 stars and 2 bars for B. So, there are 10 ways for case 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This can be represented as ****|***|**, where the first 4 stars represent the balls for A, the next 3 stars represent the balls for B, and the last 2 stars represent the ball for C. Now, we have 2 stars and 1 bar left for C. Again, we can distribute these using the stars and bars method, which gives us C(3,1) = 3 ways to distribute the 2 stars and 1 bar for C. So, there are 30 ways for case 2 (10 ways for the first 4 stars and 3 ways for the last 2 stars).

Since there are more ways for case 2 than for case 1, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of ways: 30 > 10}

There will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
