To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways (where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time). This is because we can choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C in 6C2, 4C2, and 2C2 ways, respectively, and then arrange these balls among the children. So, the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) / C(9, 6)

Similarly, in case 2, the distribution can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) ways. So, the probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) / C(9, 6)

Now, we will compare the probabilities of both cases:

P(case 1) / P(case 2) = (C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)) / (C(4, 3))

Using the formula for combinations, we get:

P(case 1) / P(case 2) = (4! / (2! * 2!)) / (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (2 * 2) / 3

Since P(case 1) > P(case 2), we can expect more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
