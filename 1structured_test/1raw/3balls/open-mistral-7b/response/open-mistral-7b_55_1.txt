To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In this scenario, we are looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C so that they have the given numbers of balls in each case.

For case 1, we have A:2, B:2, C:2, which means we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C. This can be done in 6C2 (combinations of 6 items taken 2 at a time) ways:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)
               = 720 / (2 * 24)
               = 15

For case 2, we have A:2, B:3, C:1, which means we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C. This can be done in 6C2 * 5C3 * 3C1 ways:

C(6, 2) * C(5, 3) * C(3, 1) = 15 * 120 * 6
                                         = 10800

Since we are interested in the ratio of the number of outcomes for case 1 to the number of outcomes for case 2, we can divide the number of outcomes for case 1 by the number of outcomes for case 2:

Ratio = Number of outcomes for case 1 / Number of outcomes for case 2
            = 15 / 10800
            = 0.0014

Since the ratio is significantly less than 1, we can conclude that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
