To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them.

In case 1, we can distribute the 6 balls in 3! (3 factorial) ways among the three children:

Number of ways for case 1 = 3! = 6

In case 2, there are two ways to distribute the balls between A and B: either A gets 2 and B gets 3, or A gets 3 and B gets 2. Then, there is only one way to distribute the remaining ball to C. So, for each way of distributing the balls between A and B, there is one way to distribute the ball to C.

Number of ways for case 2 = 2 * 1 = 2

Since case 1 has more ways to distribute the balls than case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
