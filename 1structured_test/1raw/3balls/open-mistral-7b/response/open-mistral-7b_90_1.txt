To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n distinct items into k nonempty groups is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n + k - 1, n - 1, k - 1) = (n + k - 1)! / [(n - 1)! (k - 1)!]

In our case, n = 6 (balls) and k = 3 (children). We'll calculate the number of ways for each case:

case 1:
C(8, 2, 2) = (8! / [(2!)(2!)]) = 28

case 2:
C(8, 2, 1) = (8! / [(2!)(1!)]) = 56

Comparing the results, case 2 has more possibilities than case 1.

{case: 2, number of times expected to occur > number of times expected to occur for case 1}
