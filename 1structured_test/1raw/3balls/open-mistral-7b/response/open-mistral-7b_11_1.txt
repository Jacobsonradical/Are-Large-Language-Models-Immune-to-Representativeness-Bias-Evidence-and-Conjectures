To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r), where n is the number of items (balls), and r is the number of children. In this case, n = 6 and r = 3.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C is C(6,2) * C(5,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150.

So, the probability of case 1 is 90/C(11,3) and the probability of case 2 is 150/C(11,3). However, C(11,3) = 165 is a common factor for both probabilities. Therefore, the ratio of the probabilities of the two cases is 90/150 = 3/5.

Since the probability of each case is a fraction, we cannot say definitively that one case will occur more frequently than the other in the long run. However, based on the ratio of their probabilities, we can say that case 1 is less likely to occur than case 2. Therefore, we would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1 over many rounds of the game.

To answer the question in the given format:
{case: 2, 1}

This means that we expect case 2 to occur more frequently than case 1. However, it's important to note that this is based on probability theory and does not guarantee that this will always be the case in every single round of the game.
