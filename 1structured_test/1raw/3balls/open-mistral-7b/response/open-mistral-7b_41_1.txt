To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, we have three possibilities for distributing the 6 balls among A, B, and C, each getting 2 balls:

1. A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) ways, which equals 15.

In case 2, we have six possibilities for distributing the 6 balls among A, B, and C, each getting the specified number of balls:

1. A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) ways, which equals 120.

However, since we are counting the case where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, and the case where A gets 2 balls, C gets 3 balls, and B gets 1 ball as two different distributions, we need to divide the number of ways by 2:

1. A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be done in 120 / 2 = 60 ways.

Now, let's find the total number of ways to distribute the balls in all possible ways, i.e., without any restrictions on the number of balls each child gets:

1. There are 720 ways to distribute the 6 balls among 3 children.

The probability of getting case 1 in one round is 15/720, and the probability of getting case 2 is 60/720. Since we are interested in finding which case occurs more frequently, we can simply compare these probabilities:

1. The probability of getting case 1 is less than the probability of getting case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

Note that the actual frequency of each case may vary depending on the specific set of rounds, but based on probability, we can expect to see more results of case 2.
