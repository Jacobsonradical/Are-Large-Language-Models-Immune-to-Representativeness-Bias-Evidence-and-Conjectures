To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then determine which case has a higher probability of occurring. We'll use combinations to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6! (720) ways to distribute the balls in total. To find the number of ways to distribute the balls with 2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child. This can be done using combinations:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15

So, there are 15 ways for case 1 to occur.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls for this case can be calculated in a similar manner:

C(6, 2) = 15 (ways to choose 2 balls for A)
C(6, 3) = 20 (ways to choose 3 balls for B)
C(6, 1) = 6 (ways to choose 1 ball for C)

Now, we multiply these values to find the total number of ways for case 2 to occur:

Ways for case 2 = C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 27,360

Now, to find the probability of each case, we divide the number of ways each case can occur by the total number of ways to distribute the balls:

P(case 1) = 15 / 720 ≈ 0.0208
P(case 2) = 27,360 / 720 ≈ 0.3819

Since the probability of case 2 is greater than that of case 1, we can expect to see more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer indicates that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
