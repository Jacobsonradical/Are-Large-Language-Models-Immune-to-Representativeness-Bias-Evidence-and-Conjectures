To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This can be solved using combinations:

C(6, 2) (choose 2 balls for A) * C(4, 2) (choose 2 balls for B) * C(2, 2) (choose 2 balls for C) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Similarly, for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 42 * 2 = 2520 ways

Now, to find out if there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we can compare the number of ways each case can occur. In this case, there are 2520 more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2, number of times more frequent: 2520}
