To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child getting 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items (balls), r is the number of items taken at a time (balls given to one child), and "!" denotes factorial.

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each child getting 2 balls is C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) * (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) * (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball is given by the combination formula C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / [2!(6-2)!]) * (4! / [3!(4-3)!]) * (1! / [1!(1-1)!]) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 120.

Now, let's find the probability of each case. The probability of an event is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(6, 3) = (6! / [3!(6-3)!]) = 20.

So, the probability of case 1 is 3375/20 = 168.75 and the probability of case 2 is 120/20 = 6.

Since the probability of an event cannot be greater than 1, we can see that the probability of case 1 is significantly higher than the probability of case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1, 1}

This means that in the long run, we would expect case 1 to occur more frequently than case 2.
