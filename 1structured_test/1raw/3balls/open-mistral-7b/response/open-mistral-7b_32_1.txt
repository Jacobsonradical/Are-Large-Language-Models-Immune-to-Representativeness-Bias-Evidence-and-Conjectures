To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring in one round of the game and then compare them.

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each child gets exactly 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items in each group.

For case 1, we have three groups with 2 items each: C(6, 2) = 15 ways.

For case 2, we have two groups with 2 items each and one group with 1 item: C(6, 2) * C(3, 1) = 15 * 3 = 45 ways.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, the probability of case 2 occurring is higher. However, we cannot determine with certainty whether the number of occurrences of case 1 or case 2 will be greater in many rounds without knowing the specifics of how many rounds are being played.

So, the answer is not definitive. It depends on the number of rounds played. If the game is played many times, there will likely be more results of case 2 than case 1. But without knowing the exact number of rounds, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
