To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is symmetrical: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in 3! (3 factorial) ways by permuting the children. So, there are 3! = 6 ways to get case 1.

In case 2, there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve this configuration. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A and C(6,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B. Since each of these choices will have one ball left for C, there are a total of C(6,2) * C(6,3) = 15 * 20 = 300 ways to get case 2.

Comparing the two, we see that there are 6 ways to get case 1 and 300 ways to get case 2. Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2, 1}

This means that in more rounds of the game, you would expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1.
