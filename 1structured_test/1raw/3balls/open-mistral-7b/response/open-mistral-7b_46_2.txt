To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare the ratios. In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n items into r non-empty boxes is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of items in each box. In our case, n = 6 (balls), and r1 = r2 = r3 = 2 (distribtions for A, B, and C in case 1), or r1 = 2, r2 = 3, r3 = 1 (distribtions for A, B, and C in case 2).

Using the multinomial coefficient formula, we get:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 ways for case 1
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 ways for case 2

Now, the ratio of the number of ways for case 1 to case 2 is:

Ratio = Number of ways for case 1 / Number of ways for case 2 = 15 / 20 = 3/4

Since the ratio is less than 1 (3/4), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This means that, in the long run, you will observe more rounds with distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 than A:2, B:2, C:2.
