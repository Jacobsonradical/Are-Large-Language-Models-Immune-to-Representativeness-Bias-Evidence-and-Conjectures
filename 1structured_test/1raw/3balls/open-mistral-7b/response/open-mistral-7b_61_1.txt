To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare those numbers. In this case, we're looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that they have the specified numbers of balls.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. The total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) ways. The total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(2,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (2! / (1! * 1!)) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1 to occur (120 > 90), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
