To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls among A, B, and C can be thought of as choosing 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and then the remaining 2 balls for C. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 720 * 720 * 1 = 504,000 ways.

In case 2, the distribution can be thought of as choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and then the remaining 1 ball for C. This can be done in 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 720 * 20 * 6 = 720,960 ways.

Comparing the two, we see that there are more ways for case 2 to occur (720,960) than for case 1 (504,000). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

{case: 2, 1 is not the correct answer in this context}
