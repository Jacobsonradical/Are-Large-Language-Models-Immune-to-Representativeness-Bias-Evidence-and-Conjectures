To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children such that each child gets a specific number of balls is given by the multinomial coefficient.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this way is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2), where C(n, r_1, r_2, ..., r_k) represents the number of ways to distribute n items into k nonempty boxes, with r_i items in the i-th box.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this way is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 3, 1).

Now, let's calculate these coefficients:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)
                      = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2)
                      = 120

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)
                      = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1)
                      = 60

Since there are three children, each distribution can occur in a round of the game. Therefore, the number of times each case can occur is just the number of ways to distribute the balls in that way.

In summary, the number of times case 1 occurs is 120, and the number of times case 2 occurs is 60.

Since 120 is larger than 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}
