To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

In case 1, the distribution of balls is symmetric, meaning each child gets 2 balls. So, the number of ways this distribution can occur is the number of ways to distribute 6 identical balls into 3 non-empty boxes. This is a problem of partitioning a set, which can be solved using the Stirling numbers of the second kind. However, in this case, we can also solve it directly by considering the order in which the children receive the balls. There are 3! (3 factorial = 6) ways to do this. Since the distribution is symmetric, we divide by 3! to avoid counting the same distribution multiple times.

In case 2, the distribution is not symmetric. Child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3, and child C gets 1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this way is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 3 for child B, and 1 for child C. This can be calculated using combinatorics: C(6, 2) (6 choose 2) for child A, C(4, 3) (4 choose 3) for child B, and C(3, 1) (3 choose 1) for child C.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Probability of case 1 = (number of ways case 1 can occur) / (total number of ways to distribute the balls)
                               = (3!) / (C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(3, 1))
                               = 6 / (60 * 4)
                               = 1 / 24

Probability of case 2 = (number of ways case 2 can occur) / (total number of ways to distribute the balls)
                               = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(3, 1) / 3!
                               = 15 * 4 * 1 / 6
                               = 10

Since the total number of ways to distribute the balls is the sum of the ways for both cases, we need to calculate it:

Total ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(3, 1) + 3!
                  = 15 * 4 * 1 + 6
                  = 120 + 6
                  = 126

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

Probability of case 1 < Probability of case 2

Since the probability of case 2 is larger, we expect to see more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer indicates that, in the long run, we should expect to see more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game.
