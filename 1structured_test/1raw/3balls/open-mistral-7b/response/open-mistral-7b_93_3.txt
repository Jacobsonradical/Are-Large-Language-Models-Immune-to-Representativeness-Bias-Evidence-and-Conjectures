To answer this question, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and determine which one has more possibilities.

In case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls.

In case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can distribute the balls in the following ways:
1. A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball (one way)
2. A gets 1 ball, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 2 balls (3C2 * 6C1 = 15 ways)
3. A gets 0 balls, B gets 4 balls, and C gets 2 balls (C(6,4) * C(3,2) = 180 ways)

So, in total, there are 1 + 15 + 180 = 201 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Since there is only one way to distribute the balls in case 1 and 201 ways in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
