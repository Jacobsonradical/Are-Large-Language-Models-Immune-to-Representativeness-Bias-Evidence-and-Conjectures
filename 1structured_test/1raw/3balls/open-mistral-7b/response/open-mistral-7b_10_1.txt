To answer this question, we need to find the probability of each case and then compare them. We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is a case of 3 partitions of 6 balls where each partition has 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This is a case of 3 partitions of 6 balls where the first partition has 2 balls, the second has 3 balls, and the third has 1 ball. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120.

Now, let's compare the probabilities of both cases. The probability of each case is the number of ways it can occur divided by the total number of ways to distribute the balls among the three children. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination C(9, 6) = 84.

Probability of case 1 = 90 / 84
Probability of case 2 = 120 / 84

Since both probabilities are less than 1, we can say that the probability of case 1 is less than the probability of case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we will observe more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that in the long run, case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more often than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
