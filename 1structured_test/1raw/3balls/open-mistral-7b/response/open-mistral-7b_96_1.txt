To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the distribution can be achieved in 3! (factorial of 3) ways, as the order of distribution does not matter. The factorial of 3 is 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the distribution can also be achieved in 3! ways. However, there are more ways to distribute 3 balls to B and 1 ball to C than to distribute 2 balls to B and 2 balls to C. This is because there are more choices for the last ball going to B than to C. The number of ways to distribute 3 balls to B and 1 ball to C is C(6,3) * C(3,1) = 20 * 3 = 60, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

So, the ratio of the number of occurrences of case 1 to case 2 is 6 (from case 1) / 60 (from case 2) = 1/10.

Since the game is repeated many times, the probability of case 1 occurring in a single round is 1/10. Therefore, the expected number of times case 1 occurs in n rounds is n * (1/10) = n/10.

Similarly, the expected number of times case 2 occurs in n rounds is also n.

Since the expected number of times case 1 occurs is less than the expected number of times case 2 occurs, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

{case: 2, 1}

This answer means that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
