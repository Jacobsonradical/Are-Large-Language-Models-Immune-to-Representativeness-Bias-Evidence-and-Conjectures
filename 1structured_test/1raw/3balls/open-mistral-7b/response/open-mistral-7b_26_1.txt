To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and then compare them. We'll use combinatorics for this.

First, let's find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (2 balls for each child). This can be done using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

In this case, n = 6 (total balls), and k = 2 (balls per child). So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 720 / (2 * 24) = 15

Now, let's find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (2 balls for A, 3 for B, and 1 for C). This can be done by multiplying the number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 for A, 3 balls from 6 for B, and 1 ball from 6 for C:

C(6, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(6, 1) = 15 * 20 * 6 = 2700

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, we can expect more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
