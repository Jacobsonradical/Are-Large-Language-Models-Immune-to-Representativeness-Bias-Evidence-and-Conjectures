To answer this question, we need to find out the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and then compare them. We'll use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is a case of distributing 6 balls into 3 boxes with 2 balls in each box. We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways this can be done: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This is a case of distributing 6 balls into 3 boxes with 2 balls in A, 3 balls in B, and 1 ball in C. We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways this can be done: C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, we have:

{case: 2, number of ways: 120}
{case: 1, number of ways: 90}

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur, we can say that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
