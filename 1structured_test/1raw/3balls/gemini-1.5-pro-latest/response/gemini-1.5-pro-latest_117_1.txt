Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2) to pick 2 balls for child A = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2) to pick 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B = 6 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C (2C2 = 1 way).
    4. **Account for ordering of children:** Since the children are distinct, we multiply by 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways to arrange the children (ABC, ACB, BAC, etc.).

    **Total favorable arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    1. **Choose balls for the child with 3 balls:** There are 3 ways to choose which child gets 3 balls.
    2. **Choose 3 balls for that child:** There are 6C3 ways to pick 3 balls for that child = 20 ways. 
    3. **Choose 2 balls for the child with 2 balls:** There are 3C2 ways to pick 2 balls from the remaining 3 = 3 ways.
    4. **The remaining ball goes to the last child:**  (1C1 = 1 way).

    **Total favorable arrangements for Case 2:** 3 * 20 * 3 * 1 = 180

**Comparison**

There are more favorable arrangements for Case 1 (540) than for Case 2 (180).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see the 2-2-2 distribution (Case 1) occur more often than the 2-3-1 distribution (Case 2). This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
