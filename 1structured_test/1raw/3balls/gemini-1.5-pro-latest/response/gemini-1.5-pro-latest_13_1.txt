Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those possibilities.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:**  The remaining 2 balls go to C (only 1 way).

   *Total ways for Case 1:* 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** There are 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** There are 1C1 ways (1 choose 1), which is 1.

   *Total ways for Case 2:* 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
