Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2) to do this, which equals 15.
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are ⁴C₂ ways, which equals 6.
    3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C.**

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **The remaining ball goes to C.**

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

Since there are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60), Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
