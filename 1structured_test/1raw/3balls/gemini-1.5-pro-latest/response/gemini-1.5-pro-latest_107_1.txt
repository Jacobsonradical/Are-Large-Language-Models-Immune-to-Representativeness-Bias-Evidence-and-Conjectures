Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more likely to occur randomly.  This is a combinatorics problem.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). Since we have 6 balls, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    2. **Choose balls for B:**  Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    * **Total favorable outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining ball automatically goes to child C. 

    * **Total favorable outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

* Case 1 has 90 favorable outcomes.
* Case 2 has 60 favorable outcomes.

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1, it's more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
