Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** Now 4 balls remain, and we choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C (only 1 way to do this).

    *Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90*

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining ball automatically goes to child C (1 way).

    *Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60*

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) compared to the distribution in Case 2.
