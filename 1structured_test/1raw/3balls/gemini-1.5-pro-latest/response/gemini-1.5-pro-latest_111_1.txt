Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children for each case and compare which case has more possible arrangements. This is a classic combinatorics problem.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more ways to distribute the balls in that configuration.
