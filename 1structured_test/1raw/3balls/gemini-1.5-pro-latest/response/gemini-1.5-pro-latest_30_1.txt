Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter.  We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do those numbers compare?

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Step 1: Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** Now 4 balls remain, and we need to choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways. 
    * **Step 3: Choose balls for C:**  The remaining 2 balls go to child C (only 1 way to do this).
    * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * **Step 3: Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C (1 way).
    * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Over many rounds, you'll see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more possible combinations that lead to that distribution.
