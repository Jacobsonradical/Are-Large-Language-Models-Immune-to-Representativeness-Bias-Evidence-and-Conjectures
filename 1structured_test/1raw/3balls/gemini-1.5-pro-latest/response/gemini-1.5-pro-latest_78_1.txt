Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3‚Å∂ = 729

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways 
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C.

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and 60 for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.
