Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways to pick 2 balls for child A.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways to pick 2 balls for child B from the remaining.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C (2C2 = 1).
    4. **Account for order of children:** Since A, B, and C are distinct, we multiply by 3! = 6 (the number of ways to order 3 things).

    Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    1. **Choose balls for the child getting 3:** 3 ways (A gets 3, B gets 3, or C gets 3).
    2. **Choose the 3 balls:** 6C3 (6 choose 3) = 20 ways to pick 3 balls for that child.
    3. **Choose 2 balls for the child getting 2:** 3C2 (3 choose 2) = 3 ways. 
    4. **The last ball goes to the remaining child automatically.**

    Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: 3 * 20 * 3 = 180

**Comparison**

There are more favorable arrangements for Case 1 (540) than Case 2 (180).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

You will see more results of case 1 (2-2-2 distribution) in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
