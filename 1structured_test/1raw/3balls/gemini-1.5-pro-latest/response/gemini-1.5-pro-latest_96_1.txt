Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children, and how many of those ways correspond to each case.  The case with more possible ways to achieve it is more likely.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). Since we have 6 balls, there are a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways, which is 6!/(2!4!) = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** After assigning balls to A, we have 4 balls left. We need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 4!/(2!2!) = 6 ways.
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    So, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways to get the arrangement A:2, B:2, C:2.

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4!/(3!1!) = 4 ways.
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C.

    So, there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways to get the arrangement A:2, B:3, C:1.

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls to get case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
