Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C, so only 1 way.

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball goes to C, so only 1 way.

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways for Case 2,  Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
