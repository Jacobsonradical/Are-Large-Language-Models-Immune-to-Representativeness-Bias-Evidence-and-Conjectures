Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6C2 = 15).
2. **Choose balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, there are 4 left.  We have 4C2 ways to choose 2 for child B (4C2 = 6).
3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

**Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for A (6C2 = 15).
2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls for B (4C3 = 4).
3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C.

**Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2.  

**{case: 1}** 

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is because there are more possible combinations that lead to an even distribution of the balls.
