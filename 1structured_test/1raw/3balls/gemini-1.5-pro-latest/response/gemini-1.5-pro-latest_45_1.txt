Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within their group doesn't matter.  We need to calculate the number of combinations for each case and compare.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. **Choosing balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.

2. **Choosing balls for B:** Now 4 balls remain, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.

3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

**Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. **Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15 ways.

2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4 ways.

3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C.

**Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more combinations for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60). 

**Answer:** {case: 1} 

**Therefore, in many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child receives 2 balls.**
