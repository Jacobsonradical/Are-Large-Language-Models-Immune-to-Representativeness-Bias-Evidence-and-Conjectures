Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare which case has more possibilities. 

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:**  After giving 2 balls to A, there are 4 left, and we need to choose 2 for B (4C2 = 6).
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   **Total possibilities for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls for B (4C3 = 4).
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C.

   **Total possibilities for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2, **Case 1 is more likely**.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
