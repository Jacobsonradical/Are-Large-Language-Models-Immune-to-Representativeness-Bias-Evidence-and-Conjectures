Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter.  (A getting ball 1 and then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 and then ball 1).

**Calculating the Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 Arrangements:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Then, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  Child C automatically gets the remaining 2 balls.

    Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 Arrangements:**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * Child C automatically gets the remaining ball.

    Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the arrangement in Case 1.

**{case: 1}**
