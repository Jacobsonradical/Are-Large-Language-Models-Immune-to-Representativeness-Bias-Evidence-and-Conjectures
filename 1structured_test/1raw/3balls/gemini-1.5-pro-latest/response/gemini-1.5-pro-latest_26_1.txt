Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls that result in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

* **Step 1: Choose balls for A:**  There are 6C2 (6 choose 2) ways to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This is 6!/(2!4!) = 15.
* **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, there are 4 left. We have 4C2 (4 choose 2) ways to pick 2 for child B. This is 4!/(2!2!) = 6.
* **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

**Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

* **Step 1: Choose balls for A:** 6C2 ways to pick 2 balls for A, which is 15 (as calculated before).
* **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** 4C3 ways to pick 3 balls for B. This is 4!/(3!1!) = 4.
* **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining 1 ball goes to C.

**Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls that result in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer:** {case: 1}
