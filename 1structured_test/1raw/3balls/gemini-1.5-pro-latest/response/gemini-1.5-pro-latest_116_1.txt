Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to achieve each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:**  1 way

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** 1 way

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
