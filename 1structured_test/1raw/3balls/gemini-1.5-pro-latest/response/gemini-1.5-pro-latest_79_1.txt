Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter.  We need to figure out:

* How many total ways are there to distribute the balls?
* How many ways are there to get each case?

**Calculations**

* **Total Ways to Distribute:** Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  From the remaining 4 balls, there are ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
    3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

    So, for Case 1, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    3. **The remaining ball goes to C.**

    So, for Case 2, there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls resulting in Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
