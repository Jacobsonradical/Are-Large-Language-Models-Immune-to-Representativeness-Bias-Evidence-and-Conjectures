Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter.  We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case and compare.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C2 = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.**

   Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C3 = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.**

   Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

* **Comparing the Cases:**

   There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve that outcome.
