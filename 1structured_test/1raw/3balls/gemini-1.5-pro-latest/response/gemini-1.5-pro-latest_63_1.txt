Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  Therefore, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions of the balls.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways to pick 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C (2C2 = 1).

    *Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90*

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C (1C1 = 1).

    *Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60*

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to result in Case 1 (90) than Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
