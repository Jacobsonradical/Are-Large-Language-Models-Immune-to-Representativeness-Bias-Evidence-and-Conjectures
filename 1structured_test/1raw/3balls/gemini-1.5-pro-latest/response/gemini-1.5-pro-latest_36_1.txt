Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  **Choose balls for A:**  6 choose 2 (6C2) = 15 ways
    *  **Choose balls for B (from the remaining):** 4 choose 2 (4C2) = 6 ways
    *  **C gets the rest:** Only 1 way to give the last 2 balls to C. 
    *  **Total for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Choose balls for A:** 6 choose 2 (6C2) = 15 ways
    * **Choose balls for B:** 4 choose 3 (4C3) = 4 ways
    * **C gets the rest:** Only 1 way left.
    * **Total for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

**Comparison**

There are more ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
