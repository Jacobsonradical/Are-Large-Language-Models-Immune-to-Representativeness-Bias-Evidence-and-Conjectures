Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 
    *  Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more possible combinations for Case 1 (90) than Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) compared to the distribution in Case 2.
