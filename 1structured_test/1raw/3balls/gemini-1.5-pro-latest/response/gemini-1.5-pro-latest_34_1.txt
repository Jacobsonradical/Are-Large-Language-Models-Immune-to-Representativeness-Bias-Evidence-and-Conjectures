Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This is because the order in which a child receives the balls doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

    * **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**

    * **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible combinations for Case 1 and 60 possible combinations for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you would expect to see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.
