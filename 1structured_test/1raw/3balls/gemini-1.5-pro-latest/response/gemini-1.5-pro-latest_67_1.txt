Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when randomly distributing 6 balls among 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of possible arrangements is 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    * After assigning 2 balls to A, we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B. This is ⁴C₂, which is 6 ways.
    *  The last 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    *  Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The last ball goes to child C.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

* **Probability of Each Case:**
    * Case 1: (Favorable Arrangements for Case 1) / (Total Possible Arrangements) = 90 / 729 
    * Case 2: (Favorable Arrangements for Case 2) / (Total Possible Arrangements) = 60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Since 90 > 60, there are more favorable arrangements for Case 1. 

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results with a 2-2-2 distribution of balls.
