Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children within each group (A, B, or C) doesn't matter.  For example, giving Ball 1 then Ball 2 to child A is the same as giving Ball 2 then Ball 1 to child A.

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are  3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 Arrangements (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

    1. **Choose balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways. 
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 Arrangements (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways.
    3. **Balls for C:**  The remaining ball goes to child C.

    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible arrangements for Case 1 and 60 possible arrangements for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
