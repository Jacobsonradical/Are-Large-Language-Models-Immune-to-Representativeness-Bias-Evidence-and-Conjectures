Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of each case occurring.  The case with the higher probability will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
   2. **Choose balls for B:** We then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. 

   Therefore, there are 15 * 6 = 90 favorable arrangements for case 1.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

   Therefore, there are 15 * 4 = 60 favorable arrangements for case 2.

* **Probabilities:**
    * Probability of Case 1: (Favorable arrangements for Case 1) / (Total possible arrangements) = 90 / 729 
    * Probability of Case 2:  60 / 729

**Conclusion**

Since 90/729 is greater than 60/729, case 1 is more likely to occur.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
