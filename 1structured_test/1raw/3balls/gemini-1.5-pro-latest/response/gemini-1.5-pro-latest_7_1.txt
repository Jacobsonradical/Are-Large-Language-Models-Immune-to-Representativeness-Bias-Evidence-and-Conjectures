Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those possibilities.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways to choose 2 for B, which is 6.
   3. **C gets the rest:**  The last 2 balls automatically go to C.

   *Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90*

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways.
   3. **C gets the remaining ball:** Only 1 ball left, so 1 way.

   *Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60*

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome of Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
