Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in *any* arrangement?
* How many of those arrangements match case 1?
* How many of those arrangements match case 2?

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   - Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).
   - With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C2 = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.**

      Total arrangements for case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C3 = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.**

      Total arrangements for case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 arrangements for case 1 and 60 arrangements for case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
