Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls among 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls go to child C.
    *  However, since the children are distinguishable (A, B, C), we need to account for the order in which we select groups of 2. We can arrange the three groups (AA, BB, CC) in 3! = 6 ways. 
    *  Total favorable arrangements for case 1: 15 * 6 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.
    * We need to account for the different orders we can choose the groups (AA, BBB, C). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the groups.
    * Total favorable arrangements for case 2: 15 * 4 * 6 = 360

**Comparison**

There are more favorable arrangements for case 1 (540) than for case 2 (360).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results with a 2-2-2 distribution of balls among the children. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
