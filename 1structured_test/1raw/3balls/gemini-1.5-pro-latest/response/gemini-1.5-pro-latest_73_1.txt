Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is  ⁶C₂ = 15.
    *  **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** Now 4 balls are left. We need to choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    *  **Step 3:  Child C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    *  **Total outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * **Step 3: Child C:** The remaining ball goes to child C.
    * **Total outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible outcomes for Case 1 and 60 possible outcomes for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than any other distribution. This is because there are more ways to arrange the balls to achieve an even distribution.
