Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case. The case with more possible ways to achieve it will be more likely to occur in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 left. We need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. 

   *Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90*

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15 (same as before).
   2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways (4 choose 3) = 4.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C.

   *Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60*

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2.  

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.**
