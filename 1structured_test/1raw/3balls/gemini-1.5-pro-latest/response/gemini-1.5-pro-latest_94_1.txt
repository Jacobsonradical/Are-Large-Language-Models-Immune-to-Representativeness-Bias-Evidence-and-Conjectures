Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Step 1: Choose balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    * **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** Now 4 balls remain, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways.
    * **Step 3: C gets the rest:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * **Total for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Step 2: Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways 
    * **Step 3: C gets the rest:**  The remaining ball goes to C.
    * **Total for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60 ways

**Comparison**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
