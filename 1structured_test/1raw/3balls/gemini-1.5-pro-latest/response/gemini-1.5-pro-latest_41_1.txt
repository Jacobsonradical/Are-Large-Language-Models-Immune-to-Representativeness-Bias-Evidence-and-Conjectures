Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those numbers.  The case with more possible arrangements is more likely.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:**  There are 4C2 ways left (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C, leaving only 1 way.

   To get the total number of arrangements for Case 1, we multiply the possibilities for each step: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:**  The remaining ball goes to C, leaving 1 way.

   Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the arrangement in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
