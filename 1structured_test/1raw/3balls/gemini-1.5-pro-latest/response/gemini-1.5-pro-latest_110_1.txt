Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). So there are 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are 4C2 ways, which is 6.
    3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

    So, for Case 1, there are 15 * 6 = 90 favorable outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are 4C3 ways, which is 4.
    3. **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**

    So, for Case 2, there are 15 * 4 = 60 favorable outcomes.

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than any other specific distribution.
