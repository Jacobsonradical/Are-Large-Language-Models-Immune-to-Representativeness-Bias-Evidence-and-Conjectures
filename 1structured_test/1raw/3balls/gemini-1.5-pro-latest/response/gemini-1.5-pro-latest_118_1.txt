Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it this way: for each ball, there are three choices (child A, child B, or child C). 

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Since each of the 6 balls has 3 choices, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to figure out how many ways we can choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 for C.
    * This is a combination problem: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = (6*5/2*1) * (4*3/2*1) * 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last one goes to C.
    * ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = (6*5/2*1) * (4*3*2/3*2*1) * 1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and only 60 for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the three children.
