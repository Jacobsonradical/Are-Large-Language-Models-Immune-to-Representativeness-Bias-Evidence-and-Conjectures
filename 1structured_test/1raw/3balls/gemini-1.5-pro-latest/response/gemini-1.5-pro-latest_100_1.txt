Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways we can distribute the balls to get each case, and then compare those numbers. The case with more possible ways of happening is more likely.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Since each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (A, B, or C), there are 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. ⁶C₂ = 15
    2. **Choose balls for B:** Now 4 balls are left, and we choose 2 for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 
    4. **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    4. **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
