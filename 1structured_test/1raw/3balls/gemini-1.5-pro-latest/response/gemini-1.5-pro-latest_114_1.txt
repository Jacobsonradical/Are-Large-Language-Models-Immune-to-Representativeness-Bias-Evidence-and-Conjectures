Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case, and then compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C.**

   Therefore, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways to distribute the balls for case 1.

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are ⁴C₃ ways, which is 4. 
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C.**

   Therefore, there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls for case 2.

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways), case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
