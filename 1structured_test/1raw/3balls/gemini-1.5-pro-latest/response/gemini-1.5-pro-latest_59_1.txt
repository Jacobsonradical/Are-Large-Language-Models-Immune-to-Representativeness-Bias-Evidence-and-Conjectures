Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls that result in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are 4C2 ways left to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B (4C2 = 6).
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The last 2 balls automatically go to child C.

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for child A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:** There are 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B (4C3 = 4).
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The last ball automatically goes to child C.

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the arrangement in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
