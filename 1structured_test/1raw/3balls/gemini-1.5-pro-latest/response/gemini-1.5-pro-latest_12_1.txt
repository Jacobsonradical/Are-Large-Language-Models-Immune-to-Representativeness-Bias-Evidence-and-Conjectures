Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2) to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A: 6C2 = 15
    2. **Choose balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways to pick 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: 4C2 = 6
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The last 2 balls automatically go to child C (2C2 = 1)

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 ways to pick 2 balls for child A: 6C2 = 15
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 ways to pick 3 balls for child B: 4C3 = 4
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The last ball goes to child C (1C1 = 1)

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and 60 for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results where each child receives 2 balls (Case 1) than any other specific distribution. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
