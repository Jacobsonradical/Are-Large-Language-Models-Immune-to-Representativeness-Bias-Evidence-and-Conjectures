Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case, and compare those numbers.  The case with more ways to distribute the balls is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways, which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C (2C2 = 1).

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C3 ways, which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C (1C1 = 1).

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer**

{case: 1}
