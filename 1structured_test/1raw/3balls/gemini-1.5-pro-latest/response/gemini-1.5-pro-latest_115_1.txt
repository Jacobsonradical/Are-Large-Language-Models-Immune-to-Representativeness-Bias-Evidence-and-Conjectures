Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, this gives us 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B (from the remaining):** 4C2 = 6 ways
    3. **C gets the remaining balls:** Only 1 way

    Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways
    3. **C gets the remaining ball:** Only 1 way

    Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible arrangements for Case 1 and 60 for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

You'll see more results like Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
