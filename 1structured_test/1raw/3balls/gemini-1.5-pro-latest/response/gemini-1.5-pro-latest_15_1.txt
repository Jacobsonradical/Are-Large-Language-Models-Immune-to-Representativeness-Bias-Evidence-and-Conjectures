Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it this way: for every ball, there are three choices (child A, B, or C). We need to figure out how many combinations lead to each case.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
   2. **Choosing balls for B:**  After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 left. We need to choose 2 for B, which can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways.
   3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   * **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ ways = 15 ways
   2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4 ways
   3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C. 

   * **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more combinations leading to Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
