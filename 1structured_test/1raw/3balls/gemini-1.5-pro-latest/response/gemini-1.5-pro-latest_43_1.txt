Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when we randomly toss 6 balls into 3 "containers" (A, B, and C).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the rest for C. 
    * Number of ways: (6C2) * (4C2) = (6*5/2*1) * (4*3/2*1) = 15 * 6 = 90
 
* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * We can have variations of this (like 3-2-1, 1-2-3, etc.).  Let's calculate for 2-3-1 and multiply by the number of variations.
    * Number of ways for 2-3-1: (6C2) * (4C3) = (6*5/2*1) * (4/1) = 15 * 4 = 60
    * There are 3! (3*2*1 = 6) different orderings of A, B, and C to get variations of 2-3-1.
    * Total arrangements for Case 2: 60 * 6 = 360

**Comparison**

* Case 1 (2-2-2): 90 favorable arrangements
* Case 2 (2-3-1): 360 favorable arrangements

**Conclusion**

Case 2 (distributions like 2-3-1) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 2}
