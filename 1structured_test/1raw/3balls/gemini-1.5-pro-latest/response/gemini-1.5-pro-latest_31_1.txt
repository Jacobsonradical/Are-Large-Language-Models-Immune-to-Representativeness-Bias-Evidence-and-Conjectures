Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways we can distribute the balls to get each case, and the case with more possible arrangements is more likely.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C.**

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C.**

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more possible ways to distribute the balls to achieve an even distribution among the children.
