Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those numbers.  The case with more possible ways to arrange the balls is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are ⁴C₂ ways to choose 2 for B, which is 6.
   3. **The remaining balls go to C:** There's only 1 way to choose the last 2 balls for C (²C₂).

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** ¹C₁ way = 1

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.**
