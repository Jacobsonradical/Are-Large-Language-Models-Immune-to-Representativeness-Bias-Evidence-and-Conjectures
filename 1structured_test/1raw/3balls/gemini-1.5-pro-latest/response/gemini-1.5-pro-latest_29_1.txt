Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it like this: each time we distribute the balls, it's like rolling a "distribution die." We want to know which side of the die (case 1 or case 2) will come up more often.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Since we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children, each ball has 3 choices of where to go. This gives us a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2) to pick 2 balls for A. This is 6!/(2!4!) = 15.
    2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2) to pick 2 balls for B from the remaining balls. This is 4!/(2!2!) = 6.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    4. **Total for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 favorable arrangements for case 1.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 = 4!/(3!1!) = 4 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    4. **Total for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60 favorable arrangements for case 2.

**Comparison**

There are more favorable arrangements for case 1 (90) than for case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Reasoning**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game because there are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve that specific arrangement.
