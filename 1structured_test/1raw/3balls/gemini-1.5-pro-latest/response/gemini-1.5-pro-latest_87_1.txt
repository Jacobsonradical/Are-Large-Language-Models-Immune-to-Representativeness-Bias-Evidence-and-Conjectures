Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children, and then see how many of those ways correspond to each case.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  Since we have 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    So, there are 15 * 6 = 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1.

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (same logic as before).
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways (we're choosing 3 balls from the remaining 4).
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

    So, there are 15 * 4 = 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2.

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2, **Case 1 is more likely**.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
