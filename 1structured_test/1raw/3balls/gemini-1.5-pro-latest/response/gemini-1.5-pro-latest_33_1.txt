Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of each case occurring. The case with the higher probability will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). Since we have 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.  This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** After assigning balls to A, we have 4 balls left. We need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6 ways.
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    *Total favorable arrangements for Case 1:* 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to child C.

    *Total favorable arrangements for Case 2:* 15 * 4 = 60

* **Probabilities:**
    * Probability of Case 1: (Favorable arrangements for Case 1) / (Total possible arrangements) = 90/729
    * Probability of Case 2: (Favorable arrangements for Case 2) / (Total possible arrangements) = 60/729

**Conclusion**

Since 90/729 is greater than 60/729, Case 1 is more likely to occur.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
