Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with distributing distinct objects (balls) into distinct categories (children). This is a classic combinatorics problem. We need to figure out how many ways there are to achieve each case and compare.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices of children to go to.  So there are 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    * **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.
    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution of Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution of Case 2.

**Answer**
{case: 1} 

**In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).**
