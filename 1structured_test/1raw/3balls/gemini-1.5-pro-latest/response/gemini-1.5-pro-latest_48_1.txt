Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls among 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total possible arrangements are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 go to child C.
    * Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4: ⁴C₂ = 6
    * However, we've overcounted the arrangements since the order we choose the groups of 2 (AABBC) doesn't matter (BBCCA is the same). We need to divide by 3! (the number of ways to order 3 things) to correct for this.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: (15 * 6) / 3! = 15

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Choose 3 balls out of 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4
    * The remaining ball goes to child C.
    * Similar to Case 1, we've overcounted because the order we choose the groups (AABCB) doesn't matter. Divide by 2! (ways to order 2 similar groups: the groups with 2 and 3 balls).
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: (15 * 4) / 2! = 30

**Comparison**

Case 2 (2-3-1) has more favorable arrangements (30) than Case 1 (2-2-2) which has 15.

**Answer**

{case: 2} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results where the balls are distributed with one child getting 3, another getting 2, and the last getting 1. This is because there are more ways to achieve this distribution compared to a perfectly even distribution.
