Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways (4 choose 2, since 2 balls are already assigned)
    3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

    Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**

    Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible arrangements for Case 1 and 60 for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
