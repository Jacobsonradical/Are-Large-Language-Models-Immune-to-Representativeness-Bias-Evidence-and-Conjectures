Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children, and how many of those ways result in each case.  The case with more possible arrangements is more likely.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  Therefore, there are 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is  ⁶C₂ (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** We have 4 balls remaining, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This is ⁴C₂, which is 6.
    * **Step 3:  Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to child C.
    * **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Over many rounds of the game, you will see more results like Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more possible ways to achieve that distribution.
