Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children for each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** ⁴C₂ = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways
   3. **C gets the remaining 2 balls:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways
   3. **C gets the remaining ball:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
