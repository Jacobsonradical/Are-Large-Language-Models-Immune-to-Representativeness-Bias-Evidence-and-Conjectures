Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). So there are  3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways (4 choose 2, since 2 balls are already with A)
    3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C:** Only 1 way.
    4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** Only 1 way.
    4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and only 60 for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than any other specific distribution of balls. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
