Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children for each case and compare which case has more possibilities.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.**

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.**

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
