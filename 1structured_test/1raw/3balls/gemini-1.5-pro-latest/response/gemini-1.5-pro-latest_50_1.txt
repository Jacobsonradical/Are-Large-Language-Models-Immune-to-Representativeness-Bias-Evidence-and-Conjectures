Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it as finding out how many different ways we can arrange the balls to get each case.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** We need to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₂ (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choosing balls for B:**  We have 4 balls left, and we need to pick 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
   3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to child C, and there's only 1 way to do this (²C₂ = 1).

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
   2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
   3. **Choosing balls for C:** ¹C₁ = 1 way.

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to distribute the balls to get the result of case 1, and only 60 ways to get the result of case 2. 

**Answer:** {case: 1} 

**Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).**
