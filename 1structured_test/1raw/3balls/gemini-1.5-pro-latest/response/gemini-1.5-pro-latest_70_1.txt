Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case, and compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C:** Only 1 way.

    Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the distribution in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer**
{case: 1}
