Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of each case occurring.  The case with the higher probability will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 for C. 
    * This is a combination problem: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ * ²C₂ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * (2!/(2!0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
    * **Probability of Case 1:** 90 / 729 = 5/41

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving 1 for C.
    * This is another combination problem: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ * ¹C₁ = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(3!1!)) * (1!/(1!0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60
    * **Probability of Case 2:** 60 / 729 = 20/243

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (5/41) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (20/243).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
