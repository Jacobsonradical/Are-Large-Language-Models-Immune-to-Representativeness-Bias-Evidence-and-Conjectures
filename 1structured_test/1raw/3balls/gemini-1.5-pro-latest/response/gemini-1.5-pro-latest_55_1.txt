Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable.  This is a combinatorics problem where we calculate the number of ways to achieve each case.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are  3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4): 4C2 = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. 
    *  Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls for B: 4C3 = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**But wait! There's more...**

We need to consider that Case 2 can happen in different ways (A:2, B:1, C:3 or A:1, B:3, C:2, etc.). We need to account for these variations:

* **Variations of Case 2:** There are 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways to order the children (ABC, ACB, BAC, etc.) 

* **Total ways for Case 2 (including variations):** 60 * 6 = 360

**Comparison**

* Case 1: 90 ways
* Case 2: 360 ways

**Answer**

{case: 2} 

**Conclusion**

There will be more results of case 2 (a 2-3-1 distribution) in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more possible ways to achieve a 2-3-1 distribution of balls than a perfectly even 2-2-2 distribution.
