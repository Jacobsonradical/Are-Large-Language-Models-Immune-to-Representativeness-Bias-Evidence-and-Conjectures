Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, this means there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    *  Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    * Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparing the Cases**

There are 90 possible combinations for Case 1 and only 60 for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Over many rounds, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than the uneven distribution of Case 2. This is because there are simply more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
