Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls is more probable.  This is a classic combinatorics problem.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choosing balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    2. **Choosing balls for B:**  After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 left. We need to choose 2 for B, which can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.
    4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and 60 for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because it has a higher number of favorable outcomes.
