Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls is more probable.  This is a classic combinatorics problem where we need to figure out the number of ways to arrange the balls for each case.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Since each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (child A, B, or C), there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  We can choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 left. We can choose 2 for B in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    4. **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining ball automatically goes to C. 
    4. **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60 ways

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in the pattern of Case 1 (90 ways) than in the pattern of Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
