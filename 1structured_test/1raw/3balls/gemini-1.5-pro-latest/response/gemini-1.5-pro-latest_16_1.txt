Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls that result in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **C gets the rest:** The remaining 2 balls go to C, with only 1 way to do this (2C2).

   * **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **C gets the rest:** 1 ball remaining, 1 way to give it to C.

   * **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.**
