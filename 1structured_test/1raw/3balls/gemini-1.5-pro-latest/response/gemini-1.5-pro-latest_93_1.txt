Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3⁶ = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C: ¹C₁ = 1 way
    *  Total favorable outcomes for case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    *  The remaining ball automatically goes to child C: ¹C₁ = 1 way
    *  Total favorable outcomes for case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for case 1 (90) than for case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results where the balls are distributed as 2-2-2 (case 1) compared to 2-3-1 (case 2).
