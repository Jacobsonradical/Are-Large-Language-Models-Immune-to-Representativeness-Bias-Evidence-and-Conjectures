Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How many total possible distributions are there?

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Distributions:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are  3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways 
    * The last 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The last ball automatically goes to child C.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
