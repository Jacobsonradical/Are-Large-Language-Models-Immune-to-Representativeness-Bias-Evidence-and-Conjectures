Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case.  The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C (only 1 way).
   4. **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 1 ball goes to C (only 1 way).
   4. **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 and 60 ways for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1, it's more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
