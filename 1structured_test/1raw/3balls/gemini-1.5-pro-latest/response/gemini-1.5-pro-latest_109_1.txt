Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls randomly among 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of ways to distribute them is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  Child C automatically gets the remaining 2 balls.
    * **However:** We've overcounted since the order we choose the children to give 2 balls to doesn't matter (A-B-C is the same as B-A-C, etc.).  We need to divide by the number of ways to order 3 things: 3! = 6 ways
    * **Total favorable outcomes for Case 1:** (15 * 6) / 6 = 15

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * Child C automatically gets the remaining ball.
    * **We still need to account for different orderings:** Divide by 3! = 6 for the different orders we could choose the children.
    * **Total favorable outcomes for Case 2:** (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

**Comparison**

* Case 1 (2-2-2) has 15 favorable outcomes.
* Case 2 (2-3-1) has 10 favorable outcomes.

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (2-2-2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer**
{case: 1}
