Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do these numbers compare?

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **C automatically gets the last 2 balls.**

   Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **C automatically gets the last ball.**

   Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer**

{case: 1}
