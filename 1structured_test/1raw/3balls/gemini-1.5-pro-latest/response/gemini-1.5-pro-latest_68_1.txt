Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of each case occurring. The case with higher probability will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, leaving the last 2 for C.
    * Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 
    * Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B (after A has 2): ⁴C₂ = 6
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.
    * However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to account for the order we chose the groups (ABC, ACB, etc.). There are 3! = 6 ways to order the three children.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Choose 3 balls out of 4 for B: ⁴C₃ = 4
    * The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.
    * Again, consider the order we could choose the children: 3! = 6
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 6 = 360

* **Probabilities:**
    * Probability of Case 1: 540/729 = 20/27
    * Probability of Case 2: 360/729 = 40/81

**Conclusion**

Since the probability of Case 1 (20/27) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (40/81), we can conclude:

**{case: 1}**

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
