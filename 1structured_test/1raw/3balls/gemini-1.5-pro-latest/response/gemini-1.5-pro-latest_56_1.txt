Here's how we can determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more likely to happen randomly. This is a combinatorics problem.

**Calculations**

* **Total possible arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are a total of 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    *  After assigning 2 balls to A, we have 4 remaining. We choose 2 for child B in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6 ways. 
    *  The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    *  Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * The last ball goes to child C.
    * Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

* **Important Note:** We need to account for the different ways we can arrange the children (A, B, C) for Case 2. Since there are 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways to order 3 things, we multiply the arrangements for Case 2 by 6: 60 * 6 = 360

**Conclusion**

There are 90 possible arrangements for Case 1 and 360 arrangements for Case 2. Since 360 is greater than 90, **Case 2 is more likely to occur**.

**Answer:**

{case: 2}
