Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter.  We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls for each case and compare.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C (only 1 way)**

   Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C (only 1 way)**

   Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in a way that results in Case 1.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
