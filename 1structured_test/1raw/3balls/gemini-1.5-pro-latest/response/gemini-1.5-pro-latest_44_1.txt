Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C). With 6 balls, that's 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1: (A:2, B:2, C:2)**
    *  Imagine choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A:  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    *  Then choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
    *  Child C automatically gets the last 2.
    *  Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2: (A:2, B:3, C:1)**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    * Child C gets the remaining ball.
    * Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more possible combinations leading to Case 1 (90) than Case 2 (60).

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion:**  In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls.
