Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls that result in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways to do this (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C (2C2 = 1).

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to do this, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** There are 4C3 ways to do this (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C (1C1 = 1).

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome in Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
