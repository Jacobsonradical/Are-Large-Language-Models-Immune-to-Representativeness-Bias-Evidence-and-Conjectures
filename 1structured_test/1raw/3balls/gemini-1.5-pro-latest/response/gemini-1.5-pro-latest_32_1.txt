Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  For each of the 6 balls, there are 3 children who could receive it. So there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:** We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    *  **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** Now 4 balls are left, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    *  **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * **Step 1: Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15
    * **Step 2: Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4
    * **Step 3: Balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.
    * **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the outcome of Case 1 (90 combinations) than Case 2 (60 combinations). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
