Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it like this: we have 6 slots (representing the balls), and we need to fill them with an "A", "B", or "C" depending on which child gets the ball.

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  For each of the 6 slots, we have 3 choices (A, B, or C).  Therefore, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total ways to distribute the balls.

* **Case 1 Arrangements (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 slots for A out of 6:  ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways.
    * Then, we choose 2 slots for B out of the remaining 4: ⁴C₂ = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 slots automatically go to C.
    * Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 Arrangements (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 slots for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 slots for B: ⁴C₃ = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways
    * The remaining slot goes to C.
    * Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are more possible arrangements for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
