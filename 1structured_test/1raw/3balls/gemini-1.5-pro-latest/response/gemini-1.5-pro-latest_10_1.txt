Here's how to determine which case will occur more often:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more likely when we randomly toss 6 balls into 3 "containers" (the children).

**Counting Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  Imagine choosing 2 balls for child A (6 choose 2 possibilities), then 2 for child B (4 choose 2 possibilities).  The remaining 2 automatically go to child C.
    *  Calculation: (6C2) * (4C2) = (6*5/2*1) * (4*3/2*1) = 15 * 6 = 90
    * **However:** We've overcounted!  Since the children are distinguishable (A-B-C is different from C-A-B), we need to account for the different orders we could pick the groups. There are 3! (3*2*1 = 6) ways to order 3 things. 
    * **Total for Case 1:** 90 / 6 = 15

* **Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * Similar to Case 1, choose 2 for A, then 3 for B, leaving 1 for C.
    * Calculation: (6C2) * (4C3) = (6*5/2*1) * (4*3*2/3*2*1) = 15 * 4 = 60
    * **Account for order:**  Again, divide by 3! (6) to account for child order: 60 / 6 = 10

**Comparison**

* Case 1 (2-2-2) has 15 possible arrangements.
* Case 2 (2-3-1) has 10 possible arrangements.

**Answer**

Since there are more ways to get a 2-2-2 distribution, it's more likely.

**{case: 1}**
