Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in "case 1"?
* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in "case 2"?
* Compare the results.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways 
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **The last 2 balls automatically go to C:** ¹C₁ = 1 way

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The last ball automatically goes to C:** ¹C₁ = 1 way

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in a way that results in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
