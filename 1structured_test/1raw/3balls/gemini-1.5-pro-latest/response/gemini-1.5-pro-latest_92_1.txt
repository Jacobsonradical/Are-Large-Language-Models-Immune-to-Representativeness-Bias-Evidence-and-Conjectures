Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it this way: for each ball, there are three choices (child A, child B, or child C).  We need to see how many different ways we can distribute the balls to get each case.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.  The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₂ (6 choose 2), which is 15.

   2. **Choosing balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 left. We need to choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.

   3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

   4. **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.

   2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.

   3. **Choosing balls for C:**  The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

   4. **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome in Case 1. 

**Answer**

{case: 1}
