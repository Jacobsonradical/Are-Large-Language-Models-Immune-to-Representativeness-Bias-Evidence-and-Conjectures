Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case.  The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.

   *Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90*

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways = 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball goes to C automatically.

   *Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60*

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the outcome in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
