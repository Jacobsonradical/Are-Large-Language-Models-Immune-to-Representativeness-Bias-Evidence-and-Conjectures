Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in *any* arrangement?
* How many of those arrangements match case 1 (2-2-2)?
* How many of those arrangements match case 2 (2-3-1)?

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**
   -  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). 
   -  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** There are ⁴C₂ ways = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways.
   3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**
   4. **Total for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90 ways

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways = 15 ways.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ ways = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways.
   3. **The remaining ball goes to C.**
   4. **We need to account for permutations of A, B, and C getting these distributions (A-B-C, A-C-B, etc.):** There are 3! = 6 permutations.
   5. **Total for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 6 = 360 ways

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2.
