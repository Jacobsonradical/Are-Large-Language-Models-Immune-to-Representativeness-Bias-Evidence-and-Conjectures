Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do these numbers of combinations compare?

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Distribute 2 balls to A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Distribute 2 balls to B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways 
   3. **Distribute the remaining 2 balls to C:** 2C2 (2 choose 2) = 1 way
   4. **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Distribute 2 balls to A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
   2. **Distribute 3 balls to B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
   3. **Distribute the remaining 1 ball to C:** 1C1 (1 choose 1) = 1 way
   4. **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and 60 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more possible combinations that lead to an even distribution of the balls.
