Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3⁶ = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 Arrangements:**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B. Child C gets the last 2 by default.
    *  This is calculated as: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) * (4*3)/(2*1) = 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 Arrangements:**
    * We choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and child C gets the last one by default.
    * This is calculated as: ⁶C₂ * ⁴C₃ = (6*5)/(2*1) * (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 possible arrangements for Case 1 and 60 possible arrangements for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
