Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations here, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter.

**Calculating Possibilities**

* **Total possible distributions:** Each of the 6 balls has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  Therefore, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    *  Then, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways. 
    *  Child C automatically gets the last 2 balls.
    *  Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * Child C gets the remaining ball.
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 ways to get the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to get the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more possible combinations that result in an even distribution of balls among the children.
