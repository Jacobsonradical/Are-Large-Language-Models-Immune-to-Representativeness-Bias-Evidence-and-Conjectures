Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 (6 choose 2)
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** ⁴C₂ = 6  (4 choose 2, since 2 are already with A)
   3. **C gets the remaining 2:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 
   3. **C gets the remaining 1:** There's only 1 way to do this.

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways (90) to distribute the balls in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) compared to Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
