Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  Since we have 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) ways = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) ways = 6 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.

    However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to account for the different orders we could choose the groups (ABC, ACB, etc.). The number of ways to order 3 things is 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways.

    Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 6 = 540

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:**  The remaining ball goes to C.

    We still need to account for the order we choose the children (3! = 6 ways).

    Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 6 = 360

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to arrange the balls to get the 2-2-2 distribution (Case 1) than the 2-3-1 distribution (Case 2).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
