Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways, which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C, so there's only 1 way.

   **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 ways, which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball goes to C, so there's only 1 way.

   **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome in Case 1 (90 ways) compared to Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
