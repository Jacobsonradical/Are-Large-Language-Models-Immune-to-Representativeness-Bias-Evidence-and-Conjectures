Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter.  We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* Which case has more possible ways to occur?

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    *  Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    *  Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
    *  The last 2 balls automatically go to C: ¹C₁ = 1 way
    *  Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for A: ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B: ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
    * The last ball automatically goes to C: ¹C₁ = 1 way
    * Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve the distribution in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer**

{case: 1}
