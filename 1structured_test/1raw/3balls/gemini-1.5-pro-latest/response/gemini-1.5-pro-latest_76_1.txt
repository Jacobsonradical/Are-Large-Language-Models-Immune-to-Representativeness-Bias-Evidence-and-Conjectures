Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a group doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do these numbers compare?

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C (only 1 way to do this).** 

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C (only 1 way).**

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways (90 vs. 60) to distribute the balls in a way that results in Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
