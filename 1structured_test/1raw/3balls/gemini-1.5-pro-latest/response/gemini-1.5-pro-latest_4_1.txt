Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways we can distribute the balls to achieve each case.  The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to do this (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are ⁴C₃ ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to C.

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and 60 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 2. 

**Answer:**

{case: 1} 

Over many rounds, you'll see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) because there are more possible ways to achieve that distribution.
