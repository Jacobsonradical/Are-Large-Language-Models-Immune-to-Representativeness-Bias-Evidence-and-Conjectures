Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). Since we have 6 balls, there are  3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** 4C2 = 6 ways (4 remaining choose 2)
   3. **C automatically gets the last 2:** 2C2 = 1 way 
   4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways
   3. **C automatically gets the last ball:** 1C1 = 1 way
   4. **Total favorable outcomes for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and 60 favorable outcomes for Case 2.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
