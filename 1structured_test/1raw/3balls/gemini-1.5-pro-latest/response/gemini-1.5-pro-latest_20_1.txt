Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (⁶C₂ = 15).
    2. **Choose balls for B:** After giving 2 balls to A, there are ⁴C₂ ways to choose 2 balls for child B (⁴C₂ = 6).
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    * Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls for child A (⁶C₂ = 15).
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways to choose 3 balls for child B (⁴C₃ = 4). 
    3. **Balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to child C.

    * Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where the balls are distributed evenly (2 to each child) than any other specific distribution.
