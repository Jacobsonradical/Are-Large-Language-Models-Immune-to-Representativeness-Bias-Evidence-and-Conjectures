Here's how we can determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, the total number of possible arrangements is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** There are ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2) to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This is 15.
    2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are ⁴C₂ ways (4 choose 2) to pick 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B. This is 6.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    4. **Account for child order:**  We've only considered one order (ABC). The balls can be distributed in 3! (3 factorial) or 6 different orders (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).

    Therefore, favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    1. **Choose balls for the child with 3 balls:** There are ³C₁ ways (3 choose 1) to choose which child gets 3 balls. This is 3.
    2. **Choose the 3 balls:** There are ⁶C₃ ways (6 choose 3) to choose the 3 balls. This is 20.
    3. **Choose 2 balls for the child with 2:**  There are ³C₂ ways (3 choose 2) to choose 2 balls from the remaining 3. This is 3.
    4. **The last ball is automatic.**

    Therefore, favorable arrangements for Case 2: 3 * 20 * 3 = 180

**Comparison**

* Case 1 (2-2-2) has 540 favorable arrangements.
* Case 2 (2-3-1) has 180 favorable arrangements.

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

There will be more results of case 1 (2-2-2) in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls evenly among the children.
