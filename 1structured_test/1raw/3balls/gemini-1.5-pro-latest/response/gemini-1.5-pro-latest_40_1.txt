Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it as figuring out how many different ways you can arrange the balls to get each case.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:** 
   Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). Since we have 6 balls, there are a total of 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 ways to distribute the balls.

* **Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:**  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in ⁶C₂ ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B. This can be done in ⁴C₂ ways, which is 6.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    So, for case 1, there are 15 * 6 = 90 possible arrangements.

* **Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

    So, for case 2, there are 15 * 4 = 60 possible arrangements.

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to arrange the balls to get the distribution in case 1 (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways). 

**Answer**

{case: 1}
