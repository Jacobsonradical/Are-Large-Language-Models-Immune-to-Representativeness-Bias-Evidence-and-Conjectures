Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** From the remaining 4 balls, there are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **C gets the rest:** The last 2 balls go to C, leaving only 1 way to do this (2C2).

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** From the remaining 4, there are 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **C gets the rest:** The last ball goes to C, leaving 1 way to do this.

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:** {case: 1}
