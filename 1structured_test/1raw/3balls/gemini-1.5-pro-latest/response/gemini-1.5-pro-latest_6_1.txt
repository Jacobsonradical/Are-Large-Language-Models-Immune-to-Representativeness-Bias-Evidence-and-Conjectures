Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter.  We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do these numbers of combinations compare?

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
   1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are ⁴C₂ ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

   **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
   1. **Choose balls for A:** ⁶C₂ ways to choose 2 balls for child A (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose balls for B:** ⁴C₃ ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for child B (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

   **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 combinations) than in Case 2 (60 combinations).

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
