Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it this way: each ball has three choices (child A, B, or C).  We want to know if certain combinations of choices are more likely than others.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each ball has 3 options, and we have 6 balls. So the total number of ways to distribute the balls is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** We need to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is 6C2 (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choosing balls for B:**  We've used 2 balls, leaving 4. We need to pick 2 out of these 4 for child B. This is 4C2, which is 6.
   3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

   So, for case 1, there are 15 * 6 = 90 favorable outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choosing balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways.
   2. **Choosing balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways.
   3. **Choosing balls for C:**  The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

    So, for case 2, there are 15 * 4 = 60 favorable outcomes.

**Comparison**

Case 1 has 90 favorable outcomes, while Case 2 has 60. 

**Answer**

{case: 1}

**Explanation**

There will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) in many rounds of the game. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls to get an even distribution among the children.
