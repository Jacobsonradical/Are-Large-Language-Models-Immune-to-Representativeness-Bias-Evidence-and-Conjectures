Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with distributing distinct objects (balls) into distinct categories (children). This is a classic combinatorics problem.  We need to figure out how many ways we can achieve each case and compare.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are 4C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B (4C2 = 6).
   3. **Choose balls for C:** The last 2 balls automatically go to child C.

   Total ways for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A (6C2 = 15).
   2. **Choose balls for B:**  There are 4C3 ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B (4C3 = 4).
   3. **Choose balls for C:**  The last ball automatically goes to child C.

   Total ways for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to achieve Case 1 (90 ways) than Case 2 (60 ways).

**Answer**

{case: 1}
