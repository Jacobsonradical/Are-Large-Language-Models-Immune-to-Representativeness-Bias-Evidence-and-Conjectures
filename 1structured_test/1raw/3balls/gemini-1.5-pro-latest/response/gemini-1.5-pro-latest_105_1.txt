Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a case doesn't matter. We need to figure out:

* How many ways are there to distribute the balls in each case?
* How do these numbers of combinations compare?

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):** 
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C2 = 6 ways
    3. **C automatically gets the remaining 2 balls.**

    Total combinations for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C3 = 4 ways
    3. **C automatically gets the remaining ball.**

    Total combinations for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more combinations (90) for Case 1 than for Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than results where one child gets 3, another gets 2, and the last gets 1 (Case 2).
