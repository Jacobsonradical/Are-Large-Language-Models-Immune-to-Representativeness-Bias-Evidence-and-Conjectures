Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of each case occurring.  The case with the higher probability will occur more often in many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are a total of 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in <sup>6</sup>C<sub>2</sub> ways (6 choose 2), which is 15 ways.
    * From the remaining 4 balls, we choose 2 for child B. This can be done in <sup>4</sup>C<sub>2</sub> ways, which is 6 ways.
    * The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Probability of Case 1:** (Favorable arrangements for Case 1) / (Total possible arrangements) = 90 / 729 

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    * Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: <sup>6</sup>C<sub>2</sub> = 15 ways.
    * Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: <sup>4</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 4 ways.
    * The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

* **Probability of Case 2:** (Favorable arrangements for Case 2) / (Total possible arrangements) = 60 / 729

**Comparison**

The probability of Case 1 (90/729) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (60/729).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2.
