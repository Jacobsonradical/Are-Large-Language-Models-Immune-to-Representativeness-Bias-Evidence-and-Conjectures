Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations, because the order we give the balls to the children within a group doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3‚Å∂ = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways 
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically (2C2 = 1)
    4. **Total ways for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to C (1C1 = 1)
    4. **Total ways for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Comparison**

There are 90 favorable outcomes for Case 1 and 60 favorable outcomes for Case 2. 

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where each child gets 2 balls (Case 1) than any other specific distribution like Case 2. This is because there are simply more ways to distribute the balls evenly.
