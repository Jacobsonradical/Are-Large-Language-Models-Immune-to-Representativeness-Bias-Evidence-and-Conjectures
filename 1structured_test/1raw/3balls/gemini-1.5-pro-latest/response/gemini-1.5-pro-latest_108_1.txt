Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many ways there are to distribute the balls in each case. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 ways
   3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.**

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball goes to C automatically.**

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to arrange the balls for Case 1 and only 60 ways for Case 2, Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
