Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls is more probable.  Think of it this way: for each ball, there are three choices (child A, B, or C). We need to see how many different ways we can get each case.

**Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2**

1. **Choosing balls for A:** We need to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₂ (6 choose 2), which is 15.
2. **Choosing balls for B:**  Now we have 4 balls left, and we need to choose 2 for child B: ⁴C₂ = 6 ways.
3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

So, the total number of ways to get case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90

**Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1**

1. **Choosing balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways.
2. **Choosing balls for B:** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways.
3. **Choosing balls for C:** The remaining ball goes to child C.

The total number of ways to get case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to distribute the balls to get the outcome of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).

**{case: 1}**
