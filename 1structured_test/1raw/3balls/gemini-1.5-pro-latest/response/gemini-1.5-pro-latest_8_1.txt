Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls for each case and compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  ⁶C₂ = 15 ways (6 choose 2)
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₂ = 6 ways 
   3. **The remaining 2 balls automatically go to C.**

   Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** ⁴C₃ = 4 ways
   3. **The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to C.**

   Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are more ways to arrange the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
