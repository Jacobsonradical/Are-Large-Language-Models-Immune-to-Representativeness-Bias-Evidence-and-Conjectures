Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out which distribution of balls (2-2-2 or 2-3-1) is more probable when distributing 6 distinct balls to 3 children.

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Arrangements:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible arrangements.

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    *  We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, leaving the last 2 for child C.
    *  Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15
    *  Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4: ⁴C₂ = 6
    *  Since the children are distinguishable, we can arrange the groups of balls in 3! = 6 ways (ABC, ACB, BAC, etc.)
    *  Total favorable arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 * 6 = 540

* **Favorable Arrangements for Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    * We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, leaving the last 1 for child C.
    * Number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6: ⁶C₂ = 15
    * Number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 4: ⁴C₃ = 4
    * We can arrange the groups of balls among the children in 3! = 6 ways.
    * Total favorable arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 6 = 360

**Conclusion**

Since there are more favorable arrangements for Case 1 (540) than for Case 2 (360), Case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

**Answer:**

{case: 1}
