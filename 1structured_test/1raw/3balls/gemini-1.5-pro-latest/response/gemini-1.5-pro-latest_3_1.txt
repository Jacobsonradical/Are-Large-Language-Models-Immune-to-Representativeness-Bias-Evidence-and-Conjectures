Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to figure out how many different ways we can distribute the balls to the children for each case, and then compare those numbers. The case with more possible arrangements is more likely to occur over many rounds.

**Calculations**

* **Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:**  There are 6C2 ways (6 choose 2), which is 15.
   2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** There are 4C2 ways (4 choose 2), which is 6.
   3. **Choose 2 balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls go to C (2C2 = 1).

   **Total arrangements for Case 1:** 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

* **Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**

   1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** There are 6C2 ways, which is 15.
   2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** There are 4C3 ways (4 choose 3), which is 4.
   3. **Choose 1 ball for C:** The remaining ball goes to C (1C1 = 1).

   **Total arrangements for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

**Conclusion**

Since there are 90 ways to achieve the distribution in Case 1 and only 60 ways to achieve Case 2, Case 1 is more likely.

**Answer**

{case: 1}
