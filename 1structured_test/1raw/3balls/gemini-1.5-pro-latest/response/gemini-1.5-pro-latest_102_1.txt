Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, not permutations. This means the order we give the balls to the children doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C).  With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible outcomes.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose 2 balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways.
    3. **The remaining 2 balls go to C automatically.**

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.
    3. **The remaining ball goes to C automatically.**

    Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you'll see more results where the balls are distributed evenly (2 to each child) than any other specific distribution. This is a common theme in probability â€“ more evenly distributed outcomes tend to be more likely.
