Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls within a specific case doesn't matter (A getting ball 1 then ball 2 is the same as getting ball 2 then ball 1).

**Calculations**

* **Total Possible Outcomes:**  Each ball has 3 choices (child A, B, or C). With 6 balls, there are 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 total possible distributions.

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways to pick 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C2 (4 choose 2) = 6 ways to pick 2 balls from the remaining 4 for child B.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

    *Total favorable outcomes for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90*

* **Favorable Outcomes for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):**
    1. **Choose balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
    2. **Choose balls for B:** 4C3 (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.
    3. **Choose balls for C:** The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.

    *Total favorable outcomes for Case 2: 15 * 4 = 60*

**Comparison**

There are more favorable outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60).

**Answer**

{case: 1} 

**Conclusion**

In many rounds of the game, you will see more results where the balls are distributed evenly (2 to each child) than the uneven distribution of Case 2.
