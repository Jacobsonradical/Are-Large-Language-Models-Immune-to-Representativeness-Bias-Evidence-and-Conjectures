Here's how to determine which case is more likely:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with combinations, as the order in which the children receive the balls doesn't matter.  We need to figure out:

* How many total ways are there to distribute the balls?
* How many ways lead to case 1 (2-2-2)?
* How many ways lead to case 2 (2-3-1)?

**Calculations**

* **Total Ways:** Each ball has 3 choices (A, B, or C).  Since we have 6 balls:
   * Total combinations = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3<sup>6</sup> = 729

* **Case 1 (2-2-2):**
    1.  **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 (6 choose 2) = 15 ways
    2.  **Choose 2 balls for B (from the remaining 4):** 4C2 = 6 ways
    3.  **C automatically gets the last 2.** 
    4.  **Total combinations for Case 1:** 15 * 6 = 90

* **Case 2 (2-3-1):**
    1.  **Choose 2 balls for A:** 6C2 = 15 ways
    2.  **Choose 3 balls for B:** 4C3 = 4 ways
    3.  **C automatically gets the last ball.**
    4.  **Account for different orderings:** We need to multiply by 3!/(2!1!1!) = 3 because the groups (2, 3, and 1 ball) can be assigned to A, B, and C in different ways.
    5.  **Total combinations for Case 2:** 15 * 4 * 3 = 180

**Conclusion**

There are more ways to get a distribution like case 2 (2-3-1) than case 1 (2-2-2).

**Answer:**

{case: 2}
