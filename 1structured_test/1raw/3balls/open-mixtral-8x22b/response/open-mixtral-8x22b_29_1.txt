The distribution of balls among children is a classic problem of combinatorics, specifically a problem of distributing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes (children).

In case 1, we are distributing the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls. This can be computed using the multinomial coefficient, which is a coefficient of the expansion of a multinomial. In this case, it can be computed as (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90.

In case 2, we are distributing the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. This can be computed as (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180.

Since 180 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is:
{case: 2}

Please note that these are the number of ways to achieve each distribution. The actual probability of each case occurring would also depend on the total number of ways to distribute the balls, which is 3^6 = 729.

However, since the number of ways to achieve case 2 is still twice the number of ways to achieve case 1, it is reasonable to say that case 2 will occur more frequently than case 1.
