The problem can be solved using combinatorics.

In the first case, we are distributing 6 identical balls into 3 groups (one for each child), where each group has 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In the second case, we are distributing 6 identical balls into 3 groups of sizes 2, 3, and 1. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways), it is more probable that case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
