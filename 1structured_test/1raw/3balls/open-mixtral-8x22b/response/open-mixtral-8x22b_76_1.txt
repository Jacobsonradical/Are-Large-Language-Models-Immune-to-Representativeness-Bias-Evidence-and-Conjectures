To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2). After child A receives 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,2). Child C will then receive the remaining 2 balls. However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to consider the order in which the children receive the balls. So, we need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange the children, which is 3!.

Thus, the number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * 3! = 15 * 6 * 6 = 540.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2). After child A receives 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,3). Child C will then receive the remaining 1 ball. Again, we need to consider the order in which the children receive the balls, so we multiply by 3!.

Thus, the number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * 3! = 15 * 4 * 6 = 360.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more outcomes than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
