To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to be chosen, and "!" denotes factorial. So, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we are left with 4 balls. We then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.

Finally, we give the remaining 2 balls to child C, which can be done in only 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is 15 (for child A) * 6 (for child B) * 1 (for child C) = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6, 2) = 15 ways.

After choosing 2 balls for child A, we are left with 4 balls. We then choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B. The number of ways to do this is C(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4.

Finally, we give the remaining 1 ball to child C, which can be done in only 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is 15 (for child A) * 4 (for child B) * 1 (for child C) = 60.

Comparing the results, case 1 can occur in 90 ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 ways. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
