The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

n = total number of items (balls) = 6
k = number of categories (children) = 3

The multinomial coefficient is given by:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! ... nk!)

where:
- n! is the factorial of n
- n1, n2, n3 are the number of items in each category

Let's calculate the number of ways for both cases:

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways: 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = (720) / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways: 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = (720) / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 (90) than for case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer:
{case: 1}
