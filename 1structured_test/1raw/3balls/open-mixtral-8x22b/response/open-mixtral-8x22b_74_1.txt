To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements = 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 (for case 1 where each child gets 2 balls)

Total arrangements = 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 (for case 2 where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball)

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

So the answer is:

{case: 1}
