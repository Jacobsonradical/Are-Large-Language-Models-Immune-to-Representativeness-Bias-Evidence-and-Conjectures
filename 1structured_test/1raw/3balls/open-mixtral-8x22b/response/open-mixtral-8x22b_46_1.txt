To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A, B, and C each receive 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with each receiving 2 balls can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with A receiving 2 balls, B receiving 3 balls, and C receiving 1 ball can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the results:
Case 1 has 90 ways of occurring, while Case 2 has 60 ways of occurring.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer:
{case: 1}
