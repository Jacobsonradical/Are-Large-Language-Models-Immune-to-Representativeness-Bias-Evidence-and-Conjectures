The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is a problem of allocating objects into distinct groups, which is solved by a multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 2, 2, and 2 balls among children A, B, and C. The number of ways for this arrangement is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6!)/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 2, 3, and 1 balls among children A, B, and C. The number of ways for this arrangement is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6!)/(2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90) than for case 2 to occur (60), it is more likely to have results for case 1 than for case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
