To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Since there are 6 balls and each child gets 2, we can calculate the number of ways this can happen by using combinations, since the order in which the children receive the balls does not matter. For each child, we choose 2 balls out of 6, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4, and finally 2 balls out of the remaining 2.

Number of ways for case 1 = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2)
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

Number of ways for case 2 = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1)
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Comparing the results, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2 because 90 is greater than 60.

Therefore, the answer is {case: 1}.
