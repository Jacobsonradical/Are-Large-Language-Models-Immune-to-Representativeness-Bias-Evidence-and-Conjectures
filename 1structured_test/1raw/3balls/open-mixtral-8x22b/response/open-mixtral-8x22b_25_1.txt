To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The probability of distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is calculated using combinations:
P(Case 1) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3^6)

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The probability of distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2, 3, and 1 is also calculated using combinations:
P(Case 2) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3^6)

Now, let's calculate the values:

P(Case 1) = (720 / (2 * 2 * 2)) * (1/729) = (720 / 8) * (1/729) = 90 * (1/729) = 90/729

P(Case 2) = (720 / (2 * 6 * 1)) * (1/729) = (720 / 12) * (1/729) = 60 * (1/729) = 60/729

Comparing the probabilities, we find that:
P(Case 1) > P(Case 2)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
