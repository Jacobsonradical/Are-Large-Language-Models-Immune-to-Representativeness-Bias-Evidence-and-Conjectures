To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is a problem of distributing distinct objects into distinct groups, which can be solved using the principle of counting in combinatorics. The total number of distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total distributions = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We are distributing 2 balls to each child, so the number of ways this can happen is:
Number of ways for case 1 = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) / (3!) = 90 / 6 = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We are distributing 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. The number of ways this can happen is:
Number of ways for case 2 = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) / (2!) = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(case 1) = Number of ways for case 1 / Total distributions = 15 / 90 = 1/6
P(case 2) = Number of ways for case 2 / Total distributions = 30 / 90 = 1/3

Since P(case 2) > P(case 1), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
