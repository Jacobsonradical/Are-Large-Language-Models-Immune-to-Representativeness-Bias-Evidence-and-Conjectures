To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare their frequencies.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the combination formula C(6,2). Then, the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,2). Finally, the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls for child C is C(2,2).

So, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2). Then, the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,3). Finally, the number of ways to choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 for child C is C(1,1).

So, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2 (90 vs 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
