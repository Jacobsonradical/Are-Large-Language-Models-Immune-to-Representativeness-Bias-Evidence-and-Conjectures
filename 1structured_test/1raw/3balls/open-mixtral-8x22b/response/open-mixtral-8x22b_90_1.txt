To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways.
After that, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 2" ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.

The number of outcomes for case 1 is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways.
Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 3" ways.
Finally, the remaining ball goes to child C.

The number of outcomes for case 2 is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = (15) * (4) = 60

Since 90 (case 1) > 60 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer:
{case: 1}
