To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of combinations and permutations. We'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them to determine which case will occur more frequently.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways. Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways. Finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to child C. However, since the order in which we choose the balls for A and B doesn't matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange A and B, which is 2! (since there are 2 different orders in which we can choose the balls for A and B). So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) / 2! = 15 * 6 / 2 = 45

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways. Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways. Finally, the remaining 1 ball will go to child C. Again, since the order in which we choose the balls for A and B doesn't matter, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange A and B, which is 2!. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) / 2! = 15 * 4 / 2 = 30

Comparing the two cases, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2, since there are 45 ways for case 1 and only 30 ways for case 2.
