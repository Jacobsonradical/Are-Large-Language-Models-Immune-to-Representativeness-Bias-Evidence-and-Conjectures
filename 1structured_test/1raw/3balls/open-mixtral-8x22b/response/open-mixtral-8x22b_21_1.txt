The distribution of balls in each case can be calculated using combinations since the balls are distinguishable and the children are distinct.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls for A out of 6, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways:
C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15 ways

Next, we choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls:
C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6 ways

Finally, the remaining 2 balls automatically go to C. However, since we have already arranged the balls for A and B, we don't need to calculate combinations for C.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls for A out of 6, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways:
C(6,2) = 15 ways

Next, we choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls:
C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4 ways

Finally, the last ball goes to C. However, as in case 1, we don't need to calculate combinations for C.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Comparing the results, case 1 has more outcomes than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Final answer:
{case: 1}
