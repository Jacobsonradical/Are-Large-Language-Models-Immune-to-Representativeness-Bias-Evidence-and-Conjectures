To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

In both cases, there are 6 distinguishable balls distributed among 3 children.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To find the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case, we will use combinations since the order in which the balls are distributed to each child does not matter. We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first child, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for the second child, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to the third child.

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
= (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!))
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we will use combinations to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
= (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!))
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Since the number of ways for case 1 is greater than the number of ways for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
