The distribution of balls to the children is a combinatorial problem. To determine the number of ways each case can occur, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The multinomial coefficient is given by n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and ni is the number of items of each type. Here, n = 6, n1 = n2 = n3 = 2.

Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for this case, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1.

Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
