The distribution of the balls can be thought of as a problem of distributing distinct items into distinct boxes (children). This is a problem of counting permutations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We are essentially looking for the number of ways to arrange AABBCC where each letter can be in any of the 6 positions. The total number of arrangements is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we are looking for arrangements of AABBBC. Again, using multinomial coefficient:

C = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 than case 2.

{case: 1}

This is because there are more ways to arrange the balls when each child gets an equal number of balls (case 1) than when one child gets one less ball than the others (case 2). This is true because in case 2, the distribution of balls is more restricted, leaving fewer possibilities.
