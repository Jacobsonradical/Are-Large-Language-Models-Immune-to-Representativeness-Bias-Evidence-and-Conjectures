The distribution of balls can be thought of as a combinatorial problem. Here, we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable children.

To find out which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2
This can occur in (6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2)/2! ways. (The division by 2! is to correct for overcounting, since the order in which we give the balls to A, B, and C does not matter.)

Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1
This can occur in (6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1) ways.

Now let's compute these:

Case 1: (6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2)/2! = (15 * 6 * 1)/2 = 45

Case 2: (6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1) = (15 * 4 * 1) = 60

So, there will be more results of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) as it has more combinations (60) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2, 45 combinations).

Therefore, the answer is: {case: 2}
