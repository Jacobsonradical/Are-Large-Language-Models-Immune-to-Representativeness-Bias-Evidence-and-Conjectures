To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 ways (6 choose 2).
Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4C2 ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls are automatically given to child C, so there is only 1 way to do that.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is 6C2 * 4C2 * 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 ways (6 choose 2).
Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4C3 ways.
Finally, the remaining 1 ball is automatically given to child C, so there is only 1 way to do that.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is 6C2 * 4C3 * 1.

Now, let's calculate the values:

For case 1:
6C2 = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15
4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6
Total ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2:
6C2 = 15 (same as above)
4C3 = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
Total ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since the number of ways for case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways for case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
