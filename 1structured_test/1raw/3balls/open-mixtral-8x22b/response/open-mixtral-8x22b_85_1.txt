The distribution of balls can be considered as a problem of combinations. We want to find out the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case, and then compare.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

This case can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient. We have 6 balls and 3 groups (A, B, C). We want to distribute 2 balls in each group.

The multinomial coefficient is given by:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, ni is the number of items in the ith group, and k is the number of groups.

For this case, the multinomial coefficient is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Again, we can use the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways to happen (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

So the answer is case 1.
