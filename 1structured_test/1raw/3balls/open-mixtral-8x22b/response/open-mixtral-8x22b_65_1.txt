To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We are distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We are distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of sizes 2, 3, and 1. The number of ways to do this is given by:

C(6; 2) * C(4; 3) * C(1; 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
