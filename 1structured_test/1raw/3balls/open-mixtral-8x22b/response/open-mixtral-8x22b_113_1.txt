This is a problem of combinatorics and probability.

In case 1, each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2) = 15. After child A gets 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of these 4 for child B is C(4,2) = 6. Then child C gets the remaining 2 balls. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 = 90.

In case 2, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2) = 15. After child A gets 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of these 4 for child B is C(4,3) = 4. Then child C gets the remaining 1 ball. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2 (90 vs 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

So, the answer is {case: 1}.

This is because case 1 has more combinations (90) than case 2 (60), which means case 1 is more likely to occur in a random distribution of the balls.
