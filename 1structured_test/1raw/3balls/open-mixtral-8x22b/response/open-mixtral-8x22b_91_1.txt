The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n, k1, k2, ..., kn) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kn!)

Where n is the total number of items (balls), k1, k2, ..., kn are the numbers of items (balls) given to the children.

Let's calculate the number of ways for both cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing both cases, we can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls according to case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
