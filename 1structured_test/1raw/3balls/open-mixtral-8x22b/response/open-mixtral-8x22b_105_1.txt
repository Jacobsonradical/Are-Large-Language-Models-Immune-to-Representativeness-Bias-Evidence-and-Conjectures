To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children, which is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 6 balls into 3 boxes, where each ball is distinguishable. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

Total number of ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Now let's calculate the number of ways to achieve each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is a symmetrical distribution, and we can use the multinomial coefficient formula again to find the number of ways to achieve this distribution:

Number of ways for case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This is an asymmetrical distribution, and the number of ways to achieve this can be calculated as follows:

Number of ways for case 2 = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Now, let's compare the probabilities of each case:

Probability of case 1 = Number of ways for case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 90 = 1
Probability of case 2 = Number of ways for case 2 / Total number of ways = 60 / 90 = 2 / 3

Since the probability of case 1 is greater than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
