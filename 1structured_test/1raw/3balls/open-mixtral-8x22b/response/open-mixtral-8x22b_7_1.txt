To solve this, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

In this case, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to select 2 balls for child A out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,2). After giving 2 balls to A, we are left with 4 balls, out of which we select 2 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. The total number of ways for case 1 is therefore C(6,2)*C(4,2) = 15*6 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets the remaining ball. The number of ways to select 2 balls for child A out of 6 is given by C(6,2). After giving 2 balls to A, we are left with 4 balls, out of which we select 3 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways. The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. The total number of ways for case 2 is therefore C(6,2)*C(4,3) = 15*4 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
