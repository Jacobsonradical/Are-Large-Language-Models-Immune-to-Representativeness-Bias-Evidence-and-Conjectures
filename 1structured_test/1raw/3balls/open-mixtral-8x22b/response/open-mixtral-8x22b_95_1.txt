To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1 is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
