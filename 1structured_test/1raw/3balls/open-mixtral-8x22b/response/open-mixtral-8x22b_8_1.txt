The distribution of balls in this scenario is a combinatorial problem. We'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Since there are 6 balls and each child gets 2, we'll first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the rest will go to child C.

The number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we'll choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and the last ball will go to child C.

The number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2 (90 ways versus 60 ways).

So, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
