The distribution of balls among the children is a combinatorial problem. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, without any restrictions, is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n, r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of balls, r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of balls each child receives, and k is the number of children.

Let's compute the number of ways to achieve the distributions of case 1 and case 2:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since the number of ways to achieve case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways to achieve case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
