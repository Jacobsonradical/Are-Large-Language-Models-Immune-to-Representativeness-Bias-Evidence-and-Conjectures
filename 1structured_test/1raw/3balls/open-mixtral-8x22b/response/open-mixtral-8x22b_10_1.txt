To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first child is given by the combination formula C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15. After the first child has chosen 2 balls, there are 4 balls left. So, the number of ways for the second child to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 is C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6. After the second child has chosen 2 balls, there are 2 balls left. So, the number of ways for the third child to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 is C(2,2) = 2! / (2! * (2-2)!) = 1. Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: One child gets 3 balls, another gets 2 balls, and the third gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 for the first child is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20. After the first child has chosen 3 balls, there are 3 balls left. So, the number of ways for the second child to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 3 is C(3,2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = 3. After the second child has chosen 2 balls, there is 1 ball left. So, the number of ways for the third child to choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 is C(1,1) = 1! / (1! * (1-1)!) = 1. However, this calculation is for a specific order (A gets 3, B gets 2, C gets 1). Since the children are distinguishable, we need to consider all possible orders. There are 3! = 6 possible orders (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA). Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is 20 * 3 * 1 * 6 = 360.

Comparing the two cases, case 2 has more ways to occur than case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
