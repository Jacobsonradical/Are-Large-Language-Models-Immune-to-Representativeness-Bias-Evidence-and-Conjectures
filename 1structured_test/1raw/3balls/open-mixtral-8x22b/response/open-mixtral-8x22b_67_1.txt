The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n, k1, k2, ..., km) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!)

where n is the total number of items, ki is the number of items in the ith category, and m is the number of categories.

Let's calculate the number of ways for both cases:

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Final answer:
{case: 1}
