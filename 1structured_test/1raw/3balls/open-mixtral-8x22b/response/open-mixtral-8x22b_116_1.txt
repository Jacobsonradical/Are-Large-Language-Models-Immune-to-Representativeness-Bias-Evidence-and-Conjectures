To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and permutations to calculate the number of possible distributions for each case.

First, let's calculate the number of distributions for case 1, where A, B, and C each receive 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6,2). After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is C(4,2). After giving 2 balls to B, we have 2 balls left, and there is only 1 way to give these 2 balls to C. Therefore, the total number of distributions for case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Next, let's calculate the number of distributions for case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6,2). After giving 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is C(4,3). After giving 3 balls to B, we have 1 ball left, and there is only 1 way to give this ball to C. Therefore, the total number of distributions for case 2 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that case 1 has more possible distributions than case 2 (90 vs. 60). Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Final answer: {case: 1}
