The distribution of 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using combinations and permutations.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children without any restrictions: This is a permutation problem since the balls are distinguishable, and we want to find the number of ways to arrange the 6 balls into 3 groups (for each of the 3 children).
The total number of arrangements is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 945

Now, let's calculate the number of arrangements for each of the cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The balls can be distributed in 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) ways, but since we have A:2, B:2, C:2 as an equivalent arrangement, we need to divide by the permutations of A, B, C which is 3! = 6.

Arrangements for case 1 = 945 / 6 = 157.5

Since the number of arrangements should be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number: Arrangements for case 1 = 158

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The balls can be distributed in 6! / (2! * 3!) ways, but since we have A:2, B:3, C:1 as an equivalent arrangement, we need to divide by the permutations of A, B, C which is 3! = 6.

Arrangements for case 2 = (6! / (2! * 3!)) / 6 = 15

Now we can compare the number of arrangements for each case:

Since Arrangements for case 1 (158) > Arrangements for case 2 (15), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
