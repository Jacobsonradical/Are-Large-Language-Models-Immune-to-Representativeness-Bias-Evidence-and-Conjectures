This problem can be solved using combinatorial mathematics.

In case 1, we are distributing 6 balls into 3 groups of 2. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient, which in this case is (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90.

In case 2, we are distributing 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1. The number of ways to do this is (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180.

So, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is {case: 2}.

In general, if the distribution of balls is more even, there will be fewer ways to distribute them, and if the distribution is more uneven, there will be more ways to distribute them. This is a consequence of the mathematics of combinations and permutations.
