To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4,2). Finally, the number of ways to distribute the last 2 balls to child C is C(2,2). The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3^6 (since each ball can go to any of the 3 children). Therefore, the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = [C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)] / 3^6

Now, let's calculate the probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4,3). Finally, the number of ways to give the last ball to child C is C(1,1). The probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = [C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)] / 3^6

Now, let's calculate the values for both probabilities:

P(case 1) = [C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)] / 3^6 = [15 * 6 * 1] / 729 ≈ 0.125
P(case 2) = [C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)] / 3^6 = [15 * 4 * 1] / 729 ≈ 0.0833

Comparing the two probabilities, we can see that case 1 has a higher probability of occurring than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
