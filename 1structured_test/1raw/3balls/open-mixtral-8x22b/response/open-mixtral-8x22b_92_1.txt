The distribution of the balls in each case can be considered as a problem of combinations and permutations.

Case 1: There are 6 balls distributed among 3 children with 2 balls each. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for the first child is C(6, 2). After choosing these balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for the second child is C(4, 2). After choosing these balls, there are 2 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for the third child is C(2, 2). However, since the balls are indistinguishable between the children, the total number of ways for case 1 is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) / A(3, 3), where A(3, 3) is the number of ways to arrange the 3 groups of 2 balls, which is 3! (3 factorial). This is because each group of 2 balls can be given to any of the 3 children, and the order of the children does not matter.

Case 2: There are 6 balls distributed among 3 children with 2, 3, and 1 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for the first child is C(6, 2). After choosing these balls, there are 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for the second child is C(4, 3). After choosing these balls, there is 1 ball left for the third child. However, since the balls are indistinguishable between the children, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) / A(3, 3), where A(3, 3) is the number of ways to arrange the 3 groups of balls, which is 3! (3 factorial). This is because each group of balls can be given to any of the 3 children, and the order of the children does not matter.

Now, let's compute the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) / A(3, 3) = (15 * 6) / 6 = 15
Case 2: C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) / A(3, 3) = (15 * 4) / 6 = 10

Since case 1 has more possible outcomes, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
