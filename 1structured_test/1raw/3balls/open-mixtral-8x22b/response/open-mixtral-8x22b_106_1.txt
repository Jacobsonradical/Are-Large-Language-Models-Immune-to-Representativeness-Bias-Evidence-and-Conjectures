To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is given by the combination formula C(6,2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15. Now, since the balls are distinguishable, we also need to consider the order in which the remaining 4 balls are given to B and C. So, there are 2! ways to distribute 2 balls to B and C.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is 15 * 2! = 30.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is again C(6,2) = 15. Now, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, which is C(4,3) = 4. The last ball goes to C, so there is only 1 way to do that.

Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Comparing the results, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
