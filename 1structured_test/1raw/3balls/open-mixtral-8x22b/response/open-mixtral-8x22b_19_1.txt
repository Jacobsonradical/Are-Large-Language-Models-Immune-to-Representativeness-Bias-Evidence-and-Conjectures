To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways (6 choose 2, or the binomial coefficient).
Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, so there's only 1 way to do this.
So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways.
Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways.
Finally, the remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, so there's only 1 way to do this.
So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) * 1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of {case: 1}.
