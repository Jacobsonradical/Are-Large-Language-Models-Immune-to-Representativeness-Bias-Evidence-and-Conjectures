The distribution of balls can be considered as a multinomial probability problem. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6, 6) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is given by:

(2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is given by:

(2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Therefore, there are more results of case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).
