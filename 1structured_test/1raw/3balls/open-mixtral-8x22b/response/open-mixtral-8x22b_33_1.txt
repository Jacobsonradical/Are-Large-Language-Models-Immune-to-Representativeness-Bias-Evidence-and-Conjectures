To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

Let's denote the balls as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4,2). Then, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls is C(2,2).

So, the probability of case 1 is:
P(case 1) = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) / C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 1

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for A, we have 4 balls left. The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4,3). Then, the number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball is C(1,1).

So, the probability of case 2 is:
P(case 2) = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) / C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 4

Since P(case 2) > P(case 1), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
