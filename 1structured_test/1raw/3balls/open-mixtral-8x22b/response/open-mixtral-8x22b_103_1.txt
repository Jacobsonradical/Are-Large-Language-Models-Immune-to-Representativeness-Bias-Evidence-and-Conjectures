The distribution of distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes (children) is a problem of counting permutations, and is also known as a problem of allocating distinct objects into distinct boxes.

Let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways.
Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways.
Finally, the last 2 balls will go to child C, which can be done in C(2,2) ways.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2)*C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 15*6*1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways.
Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways.
Finally, the last ball will go to child C, which can be done in C(1,1) ways.
Therefore, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2)*C(4,3)*C(1,1) = 15*4*1 = 60 ways.

Since there are more ways (90) for case 1 than for case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is {case: 1}.
