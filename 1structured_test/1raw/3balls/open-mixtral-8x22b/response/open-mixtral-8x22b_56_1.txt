To solve this, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Case 1: A, B, and C each get 2 balls.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2), where C(n,k) denotes the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. Similarly, there are C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, and C(2,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child C from the remaining 2 balls.

So, the probability of case 1 is:

P(case 1) = [C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)] / C(6,6)

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2). There are C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, and C(1,1) way to choose 1 ball for child C from the remaining 1 ball.

So, the probability of case 2 is:

P(case 2) = [C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)] / C(6,6)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15
C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6
C(2,2) = 2! / (2! * (2-2)!) = 1
C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4
C(1,1) = 1! / (1! * (1-1)!) = 1
C(6,6) = 6! / (6! * (6-6)!) = 1

P(case 1) = (15 * 6 * 1) / 1 = 90
P(case 2) = (15 * 4 * 1) / 1 = 60

Comparing the probabilities, P(case 1) > P(case 2), so there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
