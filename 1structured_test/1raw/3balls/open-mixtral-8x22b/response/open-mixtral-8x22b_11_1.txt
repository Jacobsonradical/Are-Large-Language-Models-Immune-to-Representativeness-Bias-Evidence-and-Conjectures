The distribution of balls in each round is a combinatorial problem. For case 1, the balls can be distributed in the following number of ways:

\[; C(6,2)C(4,2)C(2,2) = 15 \* 6 \* 1 = 90; \]

For case 2, the balls can be distributed in the following number of ways:

\[; C(6,2)C(4,3)C(1,1) = 15 \* 4 \* 1 = 60; \]

Since 90 is greater than 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
