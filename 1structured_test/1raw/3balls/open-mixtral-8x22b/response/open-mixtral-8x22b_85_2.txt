To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations from probability theory.

First, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 to give to B, and the last 2 will automatically go to C. So the total number of ways this can happen is given by:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 to give to B, and the last 1 will automatically go to C. So the total number of ways this can happen is given by:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two results, we can see that case 1 has more ways of occurring than case 2 (90 vs 60). Therefore, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Final answer:
{case: 1}
