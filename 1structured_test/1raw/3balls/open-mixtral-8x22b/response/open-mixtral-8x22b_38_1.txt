In this problem, we are dealing with combinations with repetition, also known as multichoose or stars and bars. The formula for distributing n identical items among k distinguishable boxes (in this case, balls and children) is C(n + k - 1, k - 1).

First, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1, where each child gets 2 balls:

Since there are 6 balls in total and each of the 3 children gets 2 balls, we only have 1 way to distribute the balls. Thus, there is only 1 way to achieve case 1.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:

We can use the multichoose formula C(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28. However, we need to consider that the balls are distinguishable. Since ball distributions to children A and B are fixed, we only need to find the number of ways to give 1 ball to child C from the remaining 4 balls. This can be done in 4 ways (since there are 4 balls left after distributing 2 to A and 3 to B).

Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is 4.

Since there is 1 way to achieve case 1 and 4 ways to achieve case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
