The distribution of balls can be considered as a combinatorial problem. We are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, can be computed as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2)
- Choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 for B: C(4,2)
- The remaining 2 balls go to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, can be computed as follows:
- Choose 2 balls for A: C(6,2)
- Choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 for B: C(4,3)
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), it is more likely that case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is {case: 1}.
