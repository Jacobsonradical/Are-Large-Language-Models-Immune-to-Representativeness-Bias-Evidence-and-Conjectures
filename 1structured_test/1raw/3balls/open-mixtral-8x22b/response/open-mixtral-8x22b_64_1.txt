This is a problem of combinatorics and probability. To find out the answer, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Let's first compute the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to three children. This is a problem of distributing distinguishable items into distinguishable boxes, which can be solved using the Stirling Number of the Second Kind:

S(6,3) = 6! / (6! * (1!)^3) * (1/2!)^3 * (1/3!) * 3! = 90

So there are 90 ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls to 3 children.

Now let's compute the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the remaining 2 balls will go to child C. This can be done in:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the remaining 1 ball will go to child C. This can be done in:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways

Comparing the results, we see that case 1 can occur in 90 ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 ways. Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

So the answer is: {case: 1}
