To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 can be calculated using combinations:

First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 ways.
Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4C2 ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to child C.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
6C2 * 4C2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into one group of 3, one group of 2, and one group of 1 can be calculated as follows:

First, we choose 3 balls out of 6 for child B, which can be done in 6C3 ways.
Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 3 for child A, which can be done in 3C2 ways.
Finally, the remaining ball will go to child C.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
6C3 * 3C2 = (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (3! / (2! * 1!)) = 20 * 3 = 60

Comparing the results, we see that there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect more results of case 1 than case 2.
