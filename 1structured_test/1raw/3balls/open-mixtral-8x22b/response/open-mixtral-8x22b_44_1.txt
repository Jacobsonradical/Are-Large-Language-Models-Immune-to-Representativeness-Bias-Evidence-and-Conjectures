The distribution of balls in each case can be considered as a problem of combinations, where we calculate the number of ways to choose the balls for each child.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1 and case 2:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2.
Here, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6,2), then for B it's C(4,2), and finally for C it's C(2,2).

Total ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1.
Here, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A is C(6,2), then for B it's C(4,3), and for C it's C(1,1).

Total ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
