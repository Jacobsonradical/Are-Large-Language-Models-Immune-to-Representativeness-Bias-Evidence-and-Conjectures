The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of items (balls), n1, n2, n3 are the numbers of items in each group (children), and "!" denotes factorial.

Let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 2, n3 = 2

Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 945 / 8 = 118.125 (since we cannot have a fraction of ways, we round down to 118)

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1

Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / 12 = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 than for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
