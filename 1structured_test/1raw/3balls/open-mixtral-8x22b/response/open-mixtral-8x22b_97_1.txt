The distribution of balls can be considered as a classical probability problem. We have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children. The total number of ways to distribute these 6 balls among 3 children is a permutation of 6 items taken 6 at a time, denoted as P(6,6) = 6! = 720.

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is the product of the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first child, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for the second child, and the last 2 balls automatically go to the third child. This can be calculated as (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the product of the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last ball automatically goes to C. This can be calculated as (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, Case 1 has 90 different outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 different outcomes. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
