The distribution of balls to the children can be considered as a problem of allocating 6 indistinguishable items (balls) into 3 distinguishable bins (children). This is a problem of stars and bars, which is a technique in combinatorics.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute the balls. According to the stars and bars method, the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of items (balls) and k is the number of bins (children).

So, the total number of ways is C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve the distributions for case 1 and case 2.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): This is a specific distribution, so there is only 1 way to achieve this.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): To achieve this, we first give 2 balls to A, then 3 balls to B, and the remaining ball automatically goes to C. The number of ways to do this is the multinomial coefficient (6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

However, since the balls are indistinguishable, the order in which we give the balls to A, B, and C does not matter. So, we need to divide by the number of ways to rearrange the balls within each child's set of balls. The number of ways to rearrange 2 balls is 2! = 2, the number of ways to rearrange 3 balls is 3! = 6, and the number of ways to rearrange 1 ball is 1! = 1. Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve case 2 is 60 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 5.

Comparing the two cases, there are more results for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). So, the answer is:

{case: 2}
