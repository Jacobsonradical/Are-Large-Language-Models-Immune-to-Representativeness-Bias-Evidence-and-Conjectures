To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 balls will automatically go to child C.
Number of ways = 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball will automatically go to child C.
Number of ways = 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways, there are more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
