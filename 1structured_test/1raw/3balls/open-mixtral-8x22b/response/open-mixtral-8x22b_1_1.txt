To solve this, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen and then compare.

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls.
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

nCr(6,2) * nCr(4,2) * nCr(2,2) / 3!

Here, nCr(6,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first child, nCr(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for the second child, and nCr(2,2) is the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls for the third child. We divide by 3! because the order in which we choose the children does not matter.

This gives us (15 * 6 * 1) / 6 = 15

Case 2: Child A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

nCr(6,2) * nCr(4,3) * nCr(1,1)

Here, nCr(6,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, nCr(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and nCr(1,1) is the number of ways to choose the remaining 1 ball for child C.

This gives us (15 * 4 * 1) = 60

So, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
