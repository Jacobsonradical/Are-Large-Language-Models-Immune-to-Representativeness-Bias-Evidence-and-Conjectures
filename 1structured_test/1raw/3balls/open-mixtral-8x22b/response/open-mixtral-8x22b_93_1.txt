To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

First, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways (also written as 6C2 or C(6,2)). The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 is calculated as:

6C2 = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15

After child A has received 2 balls, 4 balls are left. We need to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 2" ways:

4C2 = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6

Finally, child C will receive the remaining 2 balls. Since there are no choices left for child C, this step does not contribute to the number of ways.

Multiplying the number of ways for each child, we get the total number of ways for case 1:

Total ways for case 1 = 15 (ways for A) * 6 (ways for B) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

First, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways:

6C2 = 15 (same as in case 1)

After child A has received 2 balls, 4 balls are left. We need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 3" ways:

4C3 = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4

Finally, child C will receive the remaining 1 ball. Since there are no choices left for child C, this step does not contribute to the number of ways.

Multiplying the number of ways for each child, we get the total number of ways for case 2:

Total ways for case 2 = 15 (ways for A) * 4 (ways for B) = 60

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, we find that there are more ways for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
