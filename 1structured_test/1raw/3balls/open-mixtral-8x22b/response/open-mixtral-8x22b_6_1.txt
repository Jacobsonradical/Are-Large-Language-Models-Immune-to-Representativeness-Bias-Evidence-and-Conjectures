To solve this problem, we need to compute the number of ways each case can occur. Since there are 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations to calculate the outcomes.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we select 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 ways. Next, we select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, which can be done in 4C2 ways. Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C.

The total number of ways case 1 can occur is:
6C2 * 4C2 = 15 * 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similar to case 1, we select 2 balls out of 6 for child A in 6C2 ways. Then, we select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B in 4C3 ways. The remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

The total number of ways case 2 can occur is:
6C2 * 4C3 = 15 * 4 = 60

Comparing the total number of ways for each case, there are more results of case 1 (90) than case 2 (60).

Answer: {case: 1}
