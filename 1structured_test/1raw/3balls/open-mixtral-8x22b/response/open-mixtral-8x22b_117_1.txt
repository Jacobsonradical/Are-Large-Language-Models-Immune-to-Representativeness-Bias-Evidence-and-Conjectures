The distribution of the balls in this game is a combinatorial problem. We want to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups for each case and compare them.

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls.
Using the multinomial coefficient formula, the number of ways this case can occur is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) / 3!
= 15 * 6 * 1 / 6
= 15

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Again, using the multinomial coefficient formula, the number of ways this case can occur is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

So, there are more ways for case 2 to occur (A:2, B:3, C:1) than for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

The answer is: {case: 2}
