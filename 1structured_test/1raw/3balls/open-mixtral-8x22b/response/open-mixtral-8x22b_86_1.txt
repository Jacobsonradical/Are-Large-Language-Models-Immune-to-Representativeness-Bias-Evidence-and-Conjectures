The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem. In each round, the total number of ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total combinations = 6! / (A! * B! * C!)

where A, B, and C are the number of balls given to each child, and "!" denotes factorial.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of combinations is:

Total combinations for case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 945 / 8 = 118.125

Since the number of combinations must be a whole number, the actual number of combinations is 118 (rounded down).

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of combinations is:

Total combinations for case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / 12 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we see that case 1 has more combinations than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
