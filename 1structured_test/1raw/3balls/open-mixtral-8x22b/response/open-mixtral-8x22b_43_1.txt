The distribution of balls in this game is a combinatorial problem. Let's calculate the number of ways case 1 and case 2 can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be calculated using combinations. First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 for child C.

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we calculate the number of ways this distribution can occur:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
