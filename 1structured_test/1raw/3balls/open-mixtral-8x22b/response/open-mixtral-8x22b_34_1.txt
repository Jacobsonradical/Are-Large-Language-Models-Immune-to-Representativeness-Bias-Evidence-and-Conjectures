To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we need to select 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. This can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
Next, we select 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in 4C2 = 6 ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, so there's only 1 way to do this.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 to occur is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we need to select 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. This can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
Next, we select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in 4C3 = 4 ways.
Finally, the remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, so there's only 1 way to do this.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 to occur is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Comparing the two results, we can see that case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2 (90 vs. 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
