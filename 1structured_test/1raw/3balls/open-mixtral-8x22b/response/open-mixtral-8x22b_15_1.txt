To find out whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to compute the number of ways each case can happen and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 is given by the combination formula C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. Now, we choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, which is given by C(4,2). Finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to C. So, the total number of ways for this case is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we compute the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A and 3 balls for B, leaving 1 ball for C.

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) = (15) * (4) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), it is more likely to have results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
