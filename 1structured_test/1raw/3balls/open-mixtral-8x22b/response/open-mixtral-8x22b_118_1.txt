To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare their probabilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A out of 6 is C(6,2). Then, we have 4 balls left to distribute to child B in C(4,2) ways. Finally, the remaining 2 balls go to child C in C(2,2) ways.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for this case, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A is C(6,2), then 3 balls for child B in C(4,3) ways, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C in C(1,1) way.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children is 3^6, we can calculate the probability of each case happening and compare them.

Probability of case 1: P(case 1) = 90 / 3^6
Probability of case 2: P(case 2) = 60 / 3^6

Now, let's compare the probabilities:
P(case 1) / P(case 2) = (90 / 3^6) / (60 / 3^6) = 90 / 60 = 1.5

This means that there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
