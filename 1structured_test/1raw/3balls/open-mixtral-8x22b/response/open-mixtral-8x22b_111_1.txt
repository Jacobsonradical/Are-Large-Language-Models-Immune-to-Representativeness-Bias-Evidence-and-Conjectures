In each round of the game, there are a total of 6 distinguishable balls distributed among three children. The number of ways to distribute these balls can be calculated using combinations and permutations.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient formula to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

Number of ways (case 1) = 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we can also use the multinomial coefficient formula:

Number of ways (case 2) = 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for both cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of case 1 than case 2.

{case: 1}

The reasoning behind this answer is that since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways vs 60 ways), we would expect to see case 1 more frequently than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
