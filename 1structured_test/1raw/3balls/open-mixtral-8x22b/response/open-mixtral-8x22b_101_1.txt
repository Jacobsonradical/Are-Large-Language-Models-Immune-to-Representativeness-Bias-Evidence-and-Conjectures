To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case.

Case 1 - A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the probability of this case, we use combinations to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C from the 6 distinguishable balls. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3^6 (each ball has 3 choices).

Number of ways for Case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 3^6 = 90 / 729 ≈ 0.123457

Case 2 - A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

Number of ways for Case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways = 60 / 3^6 = 60 / 729 ≈ 0.082353

Since the probability of Case 1 is greater than the probability of Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
