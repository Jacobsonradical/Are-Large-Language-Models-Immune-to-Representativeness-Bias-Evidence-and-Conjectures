The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem. We'll calculate the number of possibilities for each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls, and we want to divide them into three groups of 2 each. We can first calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which is given by the binomial coefficient C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for child A, we are left with 4 balls for child B, and we choose 2 out of those 4. Finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to child C. So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (15) * (6) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball automatically goes to child C. So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = (15) * (4) = 60

Comparing the total number of possibilities, case 1 has more ways of happening than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
