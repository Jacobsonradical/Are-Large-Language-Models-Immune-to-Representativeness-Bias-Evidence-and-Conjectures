The distribution of balls among the children is a combinatorial problem. We'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 go to child C.
The number of ways this can happen is given by the binomial coefficient:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.
The number of ways this can happen is:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways it can occur (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways). So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Final answer: {case: 1}
