The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which in this case is 6! / (2!2!2!) for case 1 and 6! / (2!3!1!) for case 2.

For case 1 (2,2,2), the multinomial coefficient is 6! / (2!2!2!) = 90.

For case 2 (2,3,1), the multinomial coefficient is 6! / (2!3!1!) = 180.

So, there are twice as many ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 as compared to case 1. In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
