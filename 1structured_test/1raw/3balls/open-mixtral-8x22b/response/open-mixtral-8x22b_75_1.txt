The distribution of distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes (children) follows the principle of multinomial coefficients. In this case, we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable children.

Let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, then 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, then 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
