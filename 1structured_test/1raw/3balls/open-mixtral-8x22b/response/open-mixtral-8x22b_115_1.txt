To solve this problem, we will use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways:

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15 ways

Next, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 2" ways:

C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6 ways

Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, which can occur in just 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is:

15 (ways to give balls to A) * 6 (ways to give balls to B) * 1 (ways to give balls to C) = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Again, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways:

C(6,2) = 15 ways

Next, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in "4 choose 3" ways:

C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4 ways

Finally, the remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, which can occur in just 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is:

15 (ways to give balls to A) * 4 (ways to give balls to B) * 1 (ways to give balls to C) = 60 ways

Now, comparing the two cases, we can see that there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
