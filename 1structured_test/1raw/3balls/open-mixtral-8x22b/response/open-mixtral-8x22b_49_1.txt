To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
There are 6 balls, and we want to distribute 2 balls to each of the three children. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using combinations:

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
Next, choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4C2 = 6 ways.
Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, which can be done in 2C2 = 1 way.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Again, we use combinations to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls:

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in 4C3 = 4 ways.
Finally, the remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, which can be done in 1C1 = 1 way.

So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
