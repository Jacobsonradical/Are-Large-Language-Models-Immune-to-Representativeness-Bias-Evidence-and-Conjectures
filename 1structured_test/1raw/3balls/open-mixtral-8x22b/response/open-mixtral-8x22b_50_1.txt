The distribution of the balls can be analyzed using combinatorics. Each ball has 3 possible children to go to, so with 6 balls, there are a total of 3^6 combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C. This can be calculated using the combination formula "n choose k", denoted as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where "n" is the total number of items, "k" is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

For A, B, and C, we have C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls from the 6 balls. However, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to divide by the permutations of the chosen 2 balls for A, B, and C, which is 2! for each.

So, the number of ways for case 1 is:

[C(6, 2) / 2!]^3 = (15 / 2)^3 = (7.5)^3 = 421.875

Since we can't have a fraction of a combination, we'll round down to 421.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

The number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 2 has fewer combinations than case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
