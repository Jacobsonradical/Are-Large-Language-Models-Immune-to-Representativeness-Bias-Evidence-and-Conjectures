To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the combination formula C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left, and we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which is given by C(4,2). The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C. Thus, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2)
= (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!))
= (15) * (6)
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left, and we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which is given by C(4,3). The remaining 1 ball automatically goes to child C. Thus, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3)
= (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!))
= (15) * (4)
= 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2 (90 vs 60). Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
