To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To find the probability of this case, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

P(Case 1) = C(6; 2, 2, 2) / 3^6

where C(n; k1, k2, ..., km) is the multinomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to divide n elements into m groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km, and 3^6 is the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

P(Case 1) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) / 3^6
P(Case 1) = (720 / (2 * 2 * 2)) / 729
P(Case 1) = 90 / 729
P(Case 1) ≈ 0.123457

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we can calculate the probability of this case:

P(Case 2) = C(6; 2, 3, 1) / 3^6

P(Case 2) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) / 3^6
P(Case 2) = (720 / (2 * 6 * 1)) / 729
P(Case 2) = 60 / 729
P(Case 2) ≈ 0.082353

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that P(Case 1) > P(Case 2). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
