The distribution of balls in each round is a combinatorial problem. In this case, we're distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. We want to compare the number of outcomes for 2 cases:

1. Each child gets 2 balls.
2. One child gets 3 balls, one gets 2 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball.

Let's calculate the number of ways to achieve each case:

**Case 1:** Each child gets 2 balls.

First, we choose 2 balls for the first child, which can be done in 6C2 ways (combinations of 6 items taken 2 at a time). Then, we choose 2 balls for the second child from the remaining 4 balls, in 4C2 ways. The last 2 balls automatically go to the third child.

Total number of ways = 6C2 * 4C2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

**Case 2:** One child gets 3 balls, one gets 2 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball.

First, choose 3 balls for the first child in 6C3 ways, then choose 2 balls for the second child from the remaining 3 balls in 3C2 ways, and the last ball goes to the third child.

Total number of ways = 6C3 * 3C2 = (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (3! / (2! * 1!)) = 20 * 3 = 60 ways

Comparing the two cases, there are more outcomes of case 1 than case 2.
