The distribution of the balls can be considered as a combinatorial problem. We have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children, and we want to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!))
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!))
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90 ways) than in case 2 (60 ways), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
