To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Since we have 6 balls and each child gets 2, we can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C.

Number of ways for Case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
= 15 * 6 * 1
= 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we can calculate the number of ways for this case by choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.

Number of ways for Case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
= 15 * 4 * 1
= 60

Since the number of ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer:
{case: 1}
