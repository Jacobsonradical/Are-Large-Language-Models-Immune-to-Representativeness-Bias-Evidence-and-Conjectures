The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) for case 1 and 6! / (2! 3! 1!) for case 2.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 720 / 8 = 90.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 720 / 12 = 60.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 1 than case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
