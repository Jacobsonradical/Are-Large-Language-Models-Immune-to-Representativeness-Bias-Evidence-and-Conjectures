The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem. Let's calculate the number of ways each case can happen:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 automatically go to child C.
The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient, so:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball goes to child C.
C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, case 1 can occur in 90 different ways, while case 2 can occur in 60 different ways. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
