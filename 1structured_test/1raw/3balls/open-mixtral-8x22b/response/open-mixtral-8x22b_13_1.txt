In this problem, we are trying to determine which case will occur more frequently: either each child getting 2 balls (case 1), or one child getting 3 balls and the other two children getting 1 ball each (case 2).

Let's start by calculating the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls.
To find the number of ways this can happen, we can use the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: One child gets 3 balls and the other two children get 1 ball each.
First, choose which child gets 3 balls. There are 3 choices for this.
Then, distribute the remaining 3 balls among the other two children, with each getting 1 ball.

This can be calculated as: C(3, 1) * C(3, 1, 1) = 3 * (3! / (1! * 1! * 1!)) = 18

To find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, we can use the multinomial coefficient again:

C(6; 6) = 6! / (6! * 0! * 0!) = 1
C(6; 5, 1, 0) = 6! / (5! * 1! * 0!) = 6
C(6; 4, 2, 0) = 6! / (4! * 2! * 0!) = 15
C(6; 4, 1, 1) = 6! / (4! * 1! * 1!) = 30
C(6; 3, 3, 0) = 6! / (3! * 3! * 0!) = 20
C(6; 3, 2, 1) = 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 60

Adding these up, we get a total of 132 possible distributions.

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur, we see that case 1 has 90 ways, and case 2 has 18 ways. Since 90 is greater than 18, case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is {case: 1}.
