The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem. We have to calculate the number of ways each case can happen and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

This means each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is C(6,2). After A gets 2 balls, there are 4 balls left, and we choose 2 for B, which is C(4,2). Then, there are 2 balls left which will go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2).

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

This means A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is C(6,2). After A gets 2 balls, there are 4 balls left, and we choose 3 for B, which is C(4,3). Then, there's 1 ball left which will go to C. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1).

Now, let's calculate the number of ways:

Case 1: C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 because the number of ways case 1 can happen is greater than the number of ways case 2 can happen.

Answer: {case: 1}
