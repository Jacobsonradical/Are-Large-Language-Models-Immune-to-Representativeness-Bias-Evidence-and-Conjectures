To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. This can be done in 6C2 ways.
Next, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in 4C2 ways.
Finally, we give the remaining 2 balls to child C, which can be done in 2C2 ways (which is equal to 1, as there is only one way to give the remaining balls).

Using the combination formula for Case 1, we get:
6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 to give to child A. This can be done in 6C2 ways.
Next, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 to give to child B. This can be done in 4C3 ways.
Finally, we give the remaining 1 ball to child C, which can be done in 1C1 ways (which is equal to 1, as there is only one way to give the remaining ball).

Using the combination formula for Case 2, we get:
6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the results of both cases, we can see that Case 1 has more possible outcomes than Case 2 (90 vs. 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
