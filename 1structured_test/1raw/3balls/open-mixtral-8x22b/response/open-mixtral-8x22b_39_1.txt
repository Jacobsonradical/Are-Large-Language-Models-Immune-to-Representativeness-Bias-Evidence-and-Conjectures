The distribution of balls in each round is a combinatorial problem.

In case 1, we are distributing 6 balls so that each child gets 2 balls. This can occur in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) ways.

In case 2, we are distributing 6 balls so that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can occur in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) ways.

Now let's compute these:

Case 1: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
