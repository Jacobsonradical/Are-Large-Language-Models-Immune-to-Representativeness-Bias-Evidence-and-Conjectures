The distribution of balls in this scenario can be modeled as a combinatorial problem. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

These are the total number of outcomes for distributing 6 balls such that each child gets at least one ball (since the problem specifies distinguishable balls, the order in which the balls are distributed matters).

Now let's calculate the number of outcomes for each case:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is:

(2; 2) * (2; 2) * (2; 2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is:

(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of outcomes:

Case 1: 1 outcome
Case 2: 60 outcomes

Since there are many more outcomes for Case 2, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer:

{case: 2}
