The distribution of the balls is a combinatorial problem.

In case 1, we are distributing the balls such that each child gets 2 balls each. This can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first child is C(6,2). After that, we have 4 balls left and we need to choose 2 of them for the second child which can be done in C(4,2) ways. The remaining 2 balls automatically go to the third child so there is only 1 way to do that. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

In case 2, we are distributing the balls such that the first child gets 2 balls, the second child gets 3 balls and the third child gets 1 ball. This can be calculated similarly as:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 since 90 > 60.

Therefore, the answer is {case: 1}
