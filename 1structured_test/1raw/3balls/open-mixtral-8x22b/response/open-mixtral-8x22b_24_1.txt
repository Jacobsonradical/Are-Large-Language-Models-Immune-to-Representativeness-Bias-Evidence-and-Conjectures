The distribution of balls is a combinatorial problem.

For case 1, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into three groups of 2. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which is a generalization of the binomial coefficient. The multinomial coefficient for this case is given by:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we need to count the number of ways to distribute 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1. This can also be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is: {case: 1}
