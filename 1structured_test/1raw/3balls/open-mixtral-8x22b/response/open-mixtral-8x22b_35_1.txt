The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(n,n1,n2,...,nr) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nr!), where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nr are the number of items given to each child, and ! denotes factorial.

In case 1, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is:
C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

In case 2, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The number of ways to do this is:
C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
