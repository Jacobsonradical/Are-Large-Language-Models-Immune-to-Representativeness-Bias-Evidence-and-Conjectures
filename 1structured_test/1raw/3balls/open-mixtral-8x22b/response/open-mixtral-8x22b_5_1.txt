To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Since there are 6 distinguishable balls, we want to divide them into three distinguishable groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first group is given by the binomial coefficient:

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15

After choosing 2 balls for the first group, we have 4 balls left. We want to choose 2 balls out of these 4 for the second group:

C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6

After choosing 2 balls for the second group, we have 2 balls left, which automatically form the third group. However, since the three groups are distinguishable (each group corresponds to a child), we need to consider the permutations of these groups. There are 3! ways to arrange the three groups, which is:

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

So, the total number of ways for case 1 to occur is:

15 (choosing 2 balls for the first group) * 6 (choosing 2 balls for the second group) * 6 (permutations of the groups) = 540

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for case 2, we want to divide the 6 balls into three distinguishable groups of sizes 2, 3, and 1. Let's calculate the number of ways for this case:

First, choose 2 balls out of 6 for the first group (child A):

C(6,2) = 15

Next, choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for the second group (child B):

C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4

The last ball automatically goes to the third group (child C). Again, we need to consider the permutations of these groups since they are distinguishable:

3! = 6

So, the total number of ways for case 2 to occur is:

15 (choosing 2 balls for the first group) * 4 (choosing 3 balls for the second group) * 6 (permutations of the groups) = 360

Comparing the results, case 1 has more outcomes than case 2 (540 > 360). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
