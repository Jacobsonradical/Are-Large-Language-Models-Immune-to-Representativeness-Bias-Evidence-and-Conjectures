The distribution of balls in this scenario is a problem of combinations with repetitions allowed. We are distributing 6 balls among 3 children, which is equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions to the equation:

x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6

where x_i is the number of balls given to the i-th child. The number of solutions is given by the formula for combinations with repetitions:

C(n + r - 1, r - 1)

where n is the number of items to distribute (balls) and r is the number of groups (children). In this case, n = 6 and r = 3, so the formula becomes:

C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28

This means there are 28 possible ways to distribute the balls.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to achieve each case:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2): This is a specific distribution, and the number of ways to achieve it is the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to account for the fact that this distribution can occur in 3! = 6 ways (A could have 2 balls, B could have 2 balls, and C could have 2 balls, or any other permutation of these quantities). So, the actual number of ways to achieve Case 1 is 90 / 6 = 15.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1): Similarly, this is a specific distribution, and the number of ways to achieve it is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Again, since the children are distinguishable, we need to account for the fact that this distribution can occur in 3! = 6 ways (A could have 2 balls, B could have 3 balls, and C could have 1 ball, or any other permutation of these quantities). So, the actual number of ways to achieve Case 2 is 60 / 6 = 10.

Comparing the two cases, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
