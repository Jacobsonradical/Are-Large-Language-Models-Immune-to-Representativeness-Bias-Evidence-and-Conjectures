The distribution of the balls among A, B, and C is a combinatorial problem. We can use the concept of combinations to find the number of ways each case can occur. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items chosen, and "!" denotes factorial.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
