The distribution of balls in this scenario is a combinatorial problem. Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
- First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. This can be done in C(6,2) ways, which equals 15 ways.
- Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways, which equals 6 ways.
- Finally, child C gets the remaining 2 balls, which only can occur in 1 way.
- So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
- First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways, which equals 15 ways.
- Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways, which equals 4 ways.
- Finally, child C gets the remaining 1 ball, which only can occur in 1 way.
- So, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Answer: {case: 1}
