To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can happen and then compare the results.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children so that each child gets 2 balls (Case 1). We can use combinations to calculate this:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15
2. Choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6
3. The remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, so no calculation is needed.

Total arrangements for Case 1: 15 * 6 = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball:

1. Choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A: C(6, 2) = 15 (same as above)
2. Choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B: C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4
3. Choose 1 ball out of the remaining 1 for child C: C(1, 1) = 1! / (1! * (1-1)!) = 1

Total arrangements for Case 2: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we see that there are more arrangements for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1, where all children get 2 balls each.
