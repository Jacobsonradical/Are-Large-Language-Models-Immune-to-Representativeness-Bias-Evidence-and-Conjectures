The distribution of balls among the children is a combinatorial problem. In this case, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls into 3 different groups.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. To find the number of possible ways to distribute the balls for this case, we use the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose 'r' items from a set of 'n' items without regard to the order in which the items are chosen.

We have 6 balls and want to choose 2 balls for child A, 2 balls for child B, and 2 balls for child C. So, we calculate the combinations as follows:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. Similarly, we calculate the number of possible ways for this case:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since the number of possible ways for case 1 (90) is greater than the number of possible ways for case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is: {case: 1}.
