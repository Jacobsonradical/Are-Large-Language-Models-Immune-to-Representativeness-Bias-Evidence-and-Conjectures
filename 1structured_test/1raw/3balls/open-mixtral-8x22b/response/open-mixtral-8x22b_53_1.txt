The distribution of balls to children in this game follows the principle of multinomial coefficients, which is a way of counting the number of ways to place balls into distinguishable boxes (children) such that each ball is placed in exactly one box.

The multinomial coefficient formula for distributing n distinguishable balls into k distinguishable boxes is: n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of balls, and ni is the number of balls going into the ith box.

Let's calculate the number of possible ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, we find that case 1 has more possible ways (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is: {case: 1}
