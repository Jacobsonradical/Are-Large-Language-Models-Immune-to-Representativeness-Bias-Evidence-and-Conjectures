The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient. The multinomial coefficient is a generalization of the binomial coefficient, which is used when there are more than two categories or groups.

The multinomial coefficient is defined as:
n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of items in each group, and k is the number of groups.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, the multinomial coefficient is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, where one child gets 3 balls and the others get 2 and 1, the multinomial coefficient is:
6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 to occur (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So the answer is:
{case: 1}
