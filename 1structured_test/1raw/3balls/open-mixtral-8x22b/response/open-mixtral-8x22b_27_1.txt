To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare the probabilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last 2 balls automatically go to child C.
Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)
Number of ways for case 1 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!))
Number of ways for case 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, then 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and the last ball automatically goes to child C.
Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1)
Number of ways for case 2 = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!))
Number of ways for case 2 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Now that we have the number of ways for each case, we can compare their probabilities. Since the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 3^6 = 729, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(case 1) = Number of ways for case 1 / 729 = 90 / 729 = 10 / 81
P(case 2) = Number of ways for case 2 / 729 = 60 / 729 = 20 / 243

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that P(case 1) > P(case 2). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
