The distribution of balls is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the multinomial coefficient. The multinomial coefficient counts the number of ways to put "n" items into "k" bins with "n_1" items in the first bin, "n_2" items in the second bin, etc. The formula is:

n! / (n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!)

Let's calculate for both cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
n = 6, n_1 = 2, n_2 = 2, n_3 = 2
C = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
n = 6, n_1 = 2, n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1
C = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

So, the number of ways for case 1 is 90 and for case 2 is 60. This means that, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
