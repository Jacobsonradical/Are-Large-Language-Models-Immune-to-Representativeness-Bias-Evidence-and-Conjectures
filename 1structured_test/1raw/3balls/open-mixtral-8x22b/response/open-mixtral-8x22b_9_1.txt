This is a problem of combinatorics. To solve this, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways (where C denotes the combination), then choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,2) ways. The rest 2 balls go to child C. So, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6,2) ways, then choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4,3) ways. The last ball goes to child C. So, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Comparing the two results, case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2.

So, the answer is {case: 1}.
