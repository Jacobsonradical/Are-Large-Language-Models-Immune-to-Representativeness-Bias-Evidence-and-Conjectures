To solve this problem, we will calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Since all the balls are distinguishable, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for A, we are left with 4 balls. Now, we choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4, which is C(4,2). After choosing 2 balls for B, we are left with 2 balls, and there is only 1 way to give those 2 balls to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, for case 2, we first choose 2 balls for A, which is C(6,2). After choosing 2 balls for A, we are left with 4 balls. Now, we choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4, which is C(4,3). After choosing 3 balls for B, we are left with 1 ball, and there is only 1 way to give that ball to C.

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we find that case 1 has more ways to occur than case 2 (90 vs. 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
