The distribution of balls among three children is a problem of distributing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes (children), which is a problem of allocations or partitions.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient: (6! / (2!2!2!)) = 90

In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this is: (6! / (2!3!1!)) = 180

So, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
