To determine which case is more likely to occur, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case happening.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children with 2 balls each can be calculated using combinations:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to account for the arrangements of children:

A(3,3) = 3! = 6

So, the total number of ways for case 1 is:

90 * 6 = 540

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children with 2, 3, and 1 balls can be calculated as:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Now, we account for the arrangements of children:

A(3,2) = 3! / (3-2)! = 3! / 1! = 6

So, the total number of ways for case 2 is:

60 * 6 = 360

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (540) than for case 2 (360), case 1 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
