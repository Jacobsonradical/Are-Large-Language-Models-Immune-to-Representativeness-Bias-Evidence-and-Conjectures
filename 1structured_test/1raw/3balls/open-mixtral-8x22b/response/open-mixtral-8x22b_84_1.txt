The distribution of balls is a combinatorial problem. We need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children for both cases and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we are left with 4 balls. Now, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 is C(4,2). After distributing 2 balls to B, we are left with 2 balls. Now, the number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 is C(2,2).

Total number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is C(6,2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we are left with 4 balls. Now, the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is C(4,3). After distributing 3 balls to B, we are left with 1 ball. Now, the number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 is C(1,1).

Total number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
