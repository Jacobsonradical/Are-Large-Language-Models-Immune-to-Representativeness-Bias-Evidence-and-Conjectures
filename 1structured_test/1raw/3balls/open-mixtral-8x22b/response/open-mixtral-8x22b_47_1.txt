To solve this problem, we'll calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The balls are distinguishable, so we'll use permutations to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls. For each child, we need to choose 2 balls out of 6, and we have 3 children. However, since the distribution is the same for each child, we don't need to consider the order in which we choose the balls for each child. So, we'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for the first child, then 2 for the second child, and then the remaining 2 balls automatically go to the third child. This gives us:

Number of ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

For this case, we'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 balls for the first child, 3 balls for the second child, and 1 ball for the third child. This gives us:

Number of ways for case 2 = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while case 2 has 60 possible outcomes. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
