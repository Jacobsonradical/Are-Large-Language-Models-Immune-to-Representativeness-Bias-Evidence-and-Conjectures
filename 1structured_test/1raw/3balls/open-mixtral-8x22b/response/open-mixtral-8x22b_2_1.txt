To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child. This can be calculated using combinations:

C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15

Since there are 3 children, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

15 * 15 * 15 = 3375

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
We need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining ball goes to C. This can be calculated as:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

60 * 3! = 60 * 6 = 360

Since 3375 > 360, case 1 will occur more frequently than case 2.
