To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To find the number of ways this case can occur, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

Number of ways = n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

Where n is the total number of items (balls), and n1, n2, n3 are the number of items in each group (child).

For case 1, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 2, n3 = 2.

Number of ways (case 1) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
For case 2, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1.

Number of ways (case 2) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur:

90 (case 1) > 60 (case 2)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
