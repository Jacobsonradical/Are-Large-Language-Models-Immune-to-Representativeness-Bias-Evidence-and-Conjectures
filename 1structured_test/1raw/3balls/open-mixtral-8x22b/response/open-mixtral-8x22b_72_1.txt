To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case.

Let's first calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

Total ways = 6! / (A! * B! * C!)

Where A, B, and C are the number of balls each child receives.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls:

Total ways for case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball:

Total ways for case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Final answer:
{case: 1}
