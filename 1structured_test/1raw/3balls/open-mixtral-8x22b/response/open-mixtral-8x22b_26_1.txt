To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of each case occurring and compare them.

Let's start by calculating the probability of case 1. In this case, each child receives 2 balls. So, we can use the multinomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner.

For case 1, the multinomial coefficient is given by:

C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Now, let's calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6,6) = 6! / (6! * 0! * 0!) = 1 (since there are no balls left to distribute and no other children)

C(6,3,3) = 6! / (3! * 3! * 0!) = 20

C(6,4,2) = 6! / (4! * 2! * 0!) = 15

C(6,5,1) = 6! / (5! * 1! * 0!) = 6

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is the sum of the above cases, which is 1 + 20 + 15 + 6 = 42.

So, the probability of case 1 occurring is:

P(case 1) = 90 / 42 = 15/7

Now, let's calculate the probability of case 2. In this case, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball. The multinomial coefficient for this case is:

C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

So, the probability of case 2 occurring is:

P(case 2) = 60 / 42 = 10/7

Comparing the two probabilities, we see that:

P(case 1) > P(case 2)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
