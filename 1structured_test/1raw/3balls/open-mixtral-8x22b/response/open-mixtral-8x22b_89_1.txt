To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possibilities for each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items (balls), n1, n2, ..., nk are the sizes of each group, and k is the number of groups. In this case, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 2, n3 = 2, and k = 3. Plugging in the values:

C1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

So there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in case 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

So there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in case 2.

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more ways to distribute the balls than case 2, so there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
