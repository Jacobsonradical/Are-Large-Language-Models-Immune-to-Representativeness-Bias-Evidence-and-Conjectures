To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations to determine the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into groups of 2 for each of the three children can be calculated using the combination formula:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2!(6-2)!)) * (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) * (2! / (2!(2-2)!))
= (15) * (6) * (1)
= 90

So, there are 90 ways to have 2 balls for each child.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that one child gets 3, another gets 2, and the third gets 1 can be calculated as:

C(6,3) * C(3,2) * C(1,1) = (6! / (3!(6-3)!)) * (3! / (2!(3-2)!)) * (1! / (1!(1-1)!))
= (20) * (3) * (1)
= 60

So, there are 60 ways to have 2 balls for one child, 3 balls for another, and 1 ball for the remaining child.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) compared to case 2 (60 ways), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
