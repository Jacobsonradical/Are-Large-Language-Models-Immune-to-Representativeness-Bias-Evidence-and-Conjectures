To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is given by the combination formula C(6,2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15
After distributing 2 balls to child A, we have 4 balls left.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6
Finally, the remaining 2 balls will automatically go to child C, so there is only 1 way to distribute these balls.

The total number of ways case 1 can occur is the product of the above probabilities: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similar to case 1, the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is C(6,2) = 15
After distributing 2 balls to child A, we have 4 balls left.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B is C(4,3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4
The remaining 1 ball will automatically go to child C, so there is only 1 way to distribute this ball.

The total number of ways case 2 can occur is the product of the above probabilities: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since the total number of ways case 1 can occur (90) is greater than the total number of ways case 2 can occur (60), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
