The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which in this case is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 ways for case 1

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60 ways for case 2

Since there are more ways for case 1 to happen than case 2 in a single round, over many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

{case: 1}
