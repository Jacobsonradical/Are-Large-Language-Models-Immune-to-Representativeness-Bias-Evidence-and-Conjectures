To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula, which is used to determine the number of ways of arranging n items into r groups of sizes n1, n2, ..., nr.

The multinomial coefficient is given by: C(n; n1, n2, ..., nr) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nr!)

So for case 1, we have: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Using the same formula, we get: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the two cases, case 1 has more possible outcomes than case 2, with 90 possible outcomes compared to 60. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Final answer: {case: 1}
