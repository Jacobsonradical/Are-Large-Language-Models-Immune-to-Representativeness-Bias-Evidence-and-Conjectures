The distribution of balls in each round is a combinatorial problem. To calculate the number of ways each case can occur, we can use the concept of combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Here, we are choosing 2 balls for each child from 6 balls.
The number of ways this can occur is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is calculated as:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Here, we are choosing 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.
The number of ways this can occur is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is calculated as:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Comparing the number of ways each case can occur, case 1 has more possibilities (90) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
