The distribution of balls in both cases can be calculated using combinatorics.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is a multinomial coefficient problem. We are distributing 6 balls into 3 groups (A, B, and C) with 2 balls in each group.

The formula for multinomial coefficients is:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of items in each group, and k is the number of groups.

For case 1, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 2, n3 = 2, and k = 3.

The calculation is:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This is also a multinomial coefficient problem. We are distributing 6 balls into 3 groups (A, B, and C) with 2, 3, and 1 balls in each group respectively.

The formula for multinomial coefficients is:

n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

For case 2, n = 6, n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 1, and k = 3.

The calculation is:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6 * 1) = 60

Comparing the two cases:

Case 1 has 90 possibilities, and Case 2 has 60 possibilities. Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 1}
