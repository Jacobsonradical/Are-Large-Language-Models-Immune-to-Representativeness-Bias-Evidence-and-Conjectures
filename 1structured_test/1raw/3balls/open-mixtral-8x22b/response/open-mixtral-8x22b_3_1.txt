To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is given by the combination formula (6 choose 2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. Then the number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 is given by (4 choose 2). Finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to C. So the total number of ways for Case 1 is:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 is given by the combination formula (6 choose 2). After distributing 2 balls to A, we have 4 balls left. Then the number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 is given by (4 choose 3). The remaining 1 ball will go to C. So the total number of ways for Case 2 is:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways for Case 1 to occur than Case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1.
