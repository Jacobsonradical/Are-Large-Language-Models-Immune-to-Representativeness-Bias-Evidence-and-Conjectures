To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case and then compare the two results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.
C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15

Since the balls are distinguishable, the order in which we give the balls to child A does not matter. However, after giving 2 balls to child A, we now have 4 balls left and need to give 2 of them to child B. The number of ways to do this is:
C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6

Finally, we have 2 balls left, and we give both of them to child C. Since there's only one way to do this, we don't need to calculate the combinations.

The total number of ways for case 1 is the product of the number of ways for each child:
Total(case 1) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * 1 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, as in case 1:
C(6, 2) = 15

Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B:
C(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4

Finally, we have 1 ball left, and we give it to child C. Again, there's only one way to do this.

The total number of ways for case 2 is:
Total(case 2) = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * 1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Comparing the two results:
Total(case 1) = 90
Total(case 2) = 60

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
