To find out which case occurs more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in "6 choose 2" ways, denoted as C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15 ways.

Next, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6 ways.

Finally, the last 2 balls automatically go to child C, which can happen in only 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 1 can occur is 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, which can be done in C(6, 2) = 15 ways.

Next, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, which can be done in C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!) = 4 ways.

Finally, the last ball automatically goes to child C, which can happen in only 1 way.

So, the total number of ways case 2 can occur is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Since 90 ways (case 1) is greater than 60 ways (case 2), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Final answer: {case: 1}
