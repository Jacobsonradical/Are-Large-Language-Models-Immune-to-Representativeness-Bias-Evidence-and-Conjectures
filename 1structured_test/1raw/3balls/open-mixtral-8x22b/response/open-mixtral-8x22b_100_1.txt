To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

We are distributing 6 balls among 3 children, and each child gets 2 balls. In this case, we are only deciding which 2 balls go to each child. This can be calculated using combinations:

C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

So, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in Case 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Again, we are distributing 6 balls among 3 children, but this time, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This can be calculated using combinations:

C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = (6! / (2! * 4!)) * (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1! / (1! * 0!)) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

So, there are 60 ways to distribute the balls in Case 2.

Comparing the two results, Case 1 has more ways to occur than Case 2 (90 > 60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
