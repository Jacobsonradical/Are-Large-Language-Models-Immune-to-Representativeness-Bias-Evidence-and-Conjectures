The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula, which is:

C(n; k1, k2, ..., km) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!)

where n is the total number of items, ki is the number of items of type i, and the sum of k1 through km is equal to n.

First, we calculate the number of ways to achieve case 1:

n = 6
k1 = k2 = k3 = 2

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 945 / 8 = 118

Next, we calculate the number of ways to achieve case 2:

k1 = 2, k2 = 3, k3 = 1

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 720 / (2 * 6) = 60

Comparing the two cases, there are more ways to achieve case 1 (118) than case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
