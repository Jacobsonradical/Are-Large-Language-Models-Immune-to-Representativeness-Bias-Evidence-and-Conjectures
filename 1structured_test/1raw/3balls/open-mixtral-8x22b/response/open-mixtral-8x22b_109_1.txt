The distribution of balls in this scenario follows multinomial distribution.

Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) = 180

So, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Thus, the answer is {case: 2}.
