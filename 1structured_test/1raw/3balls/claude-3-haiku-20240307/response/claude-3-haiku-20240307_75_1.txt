To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of possible distributions is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 15/15 = 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of possible distributions is 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 10.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 10/15 = 2/3.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
