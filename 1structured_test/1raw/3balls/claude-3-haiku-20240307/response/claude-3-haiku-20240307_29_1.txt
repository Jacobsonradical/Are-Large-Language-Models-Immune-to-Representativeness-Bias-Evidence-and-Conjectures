To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6 choose 2, 6 choose 2, and 6 choose 2, which is 15.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6 choose 2, 6 choose 3, and 6 choose 1, which is 15.
The probability of case 2 occurring is also 15/20 = 3/4.

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, in many rounds of the game, the number of results for case 1 and case 2 will be approximately the same.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
