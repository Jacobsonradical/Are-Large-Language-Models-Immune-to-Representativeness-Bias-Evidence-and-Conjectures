To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is:
6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children in case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is:
6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 20

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2 than case 1, the probability of case 2 occurring is higher.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

The answer in the requested format is:
{case: 2}
