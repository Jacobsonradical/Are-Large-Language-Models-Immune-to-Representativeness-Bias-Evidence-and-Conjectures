To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of obtaining a specific distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is equal for all possible distributions, as the balls are distributed at random.

The total number of possible distributions is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C, out of the 6 balls. This is given by the binomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Now, let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to obtain this distribution is 1, as there is only one way to choose 2 balls for each child.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to obtain this distribution is also 1, as there is only one way to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

Since both cases have the same probability of occurrence, they will have the same number of results in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
