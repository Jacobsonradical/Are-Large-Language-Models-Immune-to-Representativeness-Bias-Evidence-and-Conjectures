To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

For case 1, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is 2 balls for each child. The total number of possible distributions for case 1 is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child from a total of 6 balls. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:

Total possible distributions for case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

For case 2, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C. The total number of possible distributions for case 2 is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from a total of 6 balls. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations:

Total possible distributions for case 2 = P(6, 2) × P(4, 3) × P(1, 1) = 720 × 24 × 1 = 17,280

Since the total possible distributions for case 2 (17,280) is significantly higher than the total possible distributions for case 1 (90), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
