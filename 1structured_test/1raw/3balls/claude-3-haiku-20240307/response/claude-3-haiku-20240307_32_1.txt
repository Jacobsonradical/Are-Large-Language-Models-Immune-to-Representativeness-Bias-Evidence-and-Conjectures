To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3C2 = 15.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3C3 = 5.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 (3/4) is higher than the probability of case 2 (1/4), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
