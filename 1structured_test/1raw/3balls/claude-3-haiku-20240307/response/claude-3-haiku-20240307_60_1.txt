To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children. The number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated using the formula for permutations:

Total number of ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 for case 1
Total number of ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 for case 2

The probability of each case occurring is proportional to the number of ways the balls can be distributed in that case.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) occurring is higher than the probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) occurring.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer:
{case: 2}
