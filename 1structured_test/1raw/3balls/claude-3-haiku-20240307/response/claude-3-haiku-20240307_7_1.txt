To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of each case can be calculated using the concept of combinations.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 3C2 * 3C2 * 3C2 = 10.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 10/20 = 1/2.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is 3C2 * 3C3 * 3C1 = 10.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 10/20 = 1/2.

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal (1/2), there will be the same number of results for case 1 and case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
