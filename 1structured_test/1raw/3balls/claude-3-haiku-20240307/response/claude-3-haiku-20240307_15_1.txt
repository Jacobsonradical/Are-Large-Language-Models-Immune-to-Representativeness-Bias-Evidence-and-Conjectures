To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

In each round, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is a combination problem. The total number of possible distributions is 6C3 = 20, which represents the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 balls.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of possible distributions is 6C2 × 6C2 × 6C2 = 15. This is because we can choose 2 balls for each child in 6C2 ways, and the order of the children does not matter.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of possible distributions is 6C2 × 6C3 × 6C1 = 5. This is because we can choose 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C, and the order of the children does not matter.

Since there are 15 possible distributions for case 1 and 5 possible distributions for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2: 1}
