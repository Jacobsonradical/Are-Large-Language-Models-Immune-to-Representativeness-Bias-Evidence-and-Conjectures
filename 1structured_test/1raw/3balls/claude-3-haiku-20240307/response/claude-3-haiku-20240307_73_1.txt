To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

The probability of each case can be calculated as follows:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is 1.
The probability of case 1 is 1/15.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is 6 (since there are 6 ways to choose the child with 1 ball).
The probability of case 2 is 6/20 = 3/10.

Since the probability of case 2 (3/10) is greater than the probability of case 1 (1/15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
