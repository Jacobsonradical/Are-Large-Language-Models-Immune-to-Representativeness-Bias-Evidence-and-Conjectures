To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is given by the multinomial distribution. The probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is:

P(case 1) = 6! / (2! 2! 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

The probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is:

P(case 2) = 6! / (2! 3! 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 20/81

Since the probability of case 2 (20/81) is greater than the probability of case 1 (15/81), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
