To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children. The number of possible distributions is 6! = 720.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this pattern is 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90.
The probability of Case 1 occurring in a single round is 90/720 = 1/8.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this pattern is 6C2 × 5C3 × 1C1 = 15 × 10 × 1 = 150.
The probability of Case 2 occurring in a single round is 150/720 = 5/24.

Since the probability of Case 2 (5/24) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (1/8), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
