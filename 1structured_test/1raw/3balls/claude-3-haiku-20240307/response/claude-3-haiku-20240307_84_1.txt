To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:a, B:b, C:c) = (6! / (a! * b! * c!)) * (1/3)^6

where a, b, and c are the number of balls each child receives, and the sum of a, b, and c is always 6.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
P(A:2, B:2, C:2) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
P(A:2, B:3, C:1) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 10/81

Since the probability of case 1 (15/81) is greater than the probability of case 2 (10/81), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
