To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3C2 = 15.
The probability of this case occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3C3 = 5.
The probability of this case occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 (3/4) is greater than the probability of case 2 (1/4), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
