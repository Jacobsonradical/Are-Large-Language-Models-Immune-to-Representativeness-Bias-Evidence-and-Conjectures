To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children, and the probability of each possible distribution is equal.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the probability of this distribution is:
Probability of case 1 = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) / (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 15 / 90 = 1/6

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the probability of this distribution is:
Probability of case 2 = (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) / (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 / 120 = 1/8

Since the probability of case 1 (1/6) is greater than the probability of case 2 (1/8), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2: 1}
