To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and combinatorics.

In each round of the game, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C. The possible distributions can be calculated using the combination formula.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is given by the combination formula: 6C2 × 3C2 × 3C2 = 15 × 3 × 3 = 135.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is given by the combination formula: 6C2 × 6C3 × 6C1 = 15 × 20 × 6 = 1800.

Comparing the two cases, there are more possible ways to obtain case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

The answer format is:
{case: your answer, 1 or 2}

{case: 2, 1 or 2}
