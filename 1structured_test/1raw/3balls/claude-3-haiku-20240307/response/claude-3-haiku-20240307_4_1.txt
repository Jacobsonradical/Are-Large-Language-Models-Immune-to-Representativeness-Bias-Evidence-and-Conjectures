To determine which case is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 20.

Therefore, the probability of Case 2 occurring is higher than the probability of Case 1 occurring.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

{case: 2}
