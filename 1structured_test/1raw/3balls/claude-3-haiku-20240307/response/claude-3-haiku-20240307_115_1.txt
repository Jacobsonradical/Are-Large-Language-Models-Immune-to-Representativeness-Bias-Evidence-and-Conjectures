To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, there are 6 distinguishable balls that are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6C3 = 20.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3C2 = 15.
The probability of this case occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3C3 = 5.
The probability of this case occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of Case 1 occurring is higher than the probability of Case 2 occurring, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1}
