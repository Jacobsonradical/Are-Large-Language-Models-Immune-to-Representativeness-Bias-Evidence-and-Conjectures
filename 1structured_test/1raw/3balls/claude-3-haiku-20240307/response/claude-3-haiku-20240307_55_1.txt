To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children (A, B, C) can be considered as a combination problem.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this manner is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this manner is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6^3 = 216.

Now, the probability of each case occurring is the ratio of the number of ways the case can occur to the total number of possible distributions:

Case 1: 90/216 = 5/12
Case 2: 60/216 = 5/18

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
