To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6!) / (x! * y! * z!) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls received by A, B, and C, respectively.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
P(Case 1) = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81 ≈ 0.185

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
P(Case 2) = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 10/81 ≈ 0.123

Since the probability of Case 1 (0.185) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (0.123), there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, your answer: 1}
