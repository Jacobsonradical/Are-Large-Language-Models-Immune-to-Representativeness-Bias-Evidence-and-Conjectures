To determine which case, 1 or 2, will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

In each round, we have 6 distinguishable balls to be distributed among the three children, A, B, and C.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each receive 2 balls, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
6C2 × 6C2 × 6C2 = 15 × 15 × 15 = 3,375

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
6C2 × 6C3 × 6C1 = 15 × 20 × 6 = 1,800

The number of possible ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (3,375) is greater than the number of possible ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (1,800).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
