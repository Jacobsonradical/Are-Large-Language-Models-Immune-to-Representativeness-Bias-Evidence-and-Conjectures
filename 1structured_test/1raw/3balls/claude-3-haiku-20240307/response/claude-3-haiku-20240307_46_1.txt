To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children (A, B, and C). The balls are distributed at random among the children.

Let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is 1 (since the order of the balls doesn't matter).
Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 1/15 = 0.0667 or approximately 6.67%.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is 1 (since the order of the balls doesn't matter).
Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is 1/20 = 0.05 or 5%.

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has a higher probability of occurrence than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2: 1}
