To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C6 = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15.
The probability of Case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 5.
The probability of Case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of Case 1 (3/4) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (1/4), there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
