To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, we have 6 balls to be distributed among the three children (A, B, and C). The total number of possible ways to distribute the balls is 6 choose 3, which is equal to 20.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 3 choose 2, which is equal to 3. This is because there are 3 ways to choose the 2 balls for child A, and the remaining 4 balls will be distributed among children B and C.

For case 2, where child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 3 choose 2, which is equal to 3. This is because there are 3 ways to choose the 2 balls for child A, and the remaining 4 balls will be distributed among children B and C.

Since the number of possible ways to achieve case 1 and case 2 are both 3, the probability of each case occurring in a single round is the same, which is 3/20 or 0.15.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, the number of results of case 1 and case 2 will be approximately equal, and there will not be significantly more results of one case over the other.
