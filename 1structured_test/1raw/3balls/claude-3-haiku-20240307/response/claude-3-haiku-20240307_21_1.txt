To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

In each round, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children can be considered as a combination problem. The total number of possible distributions is given by the combination formula:

Total number of distributions = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
The probability of this case is 90/90 = 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.
The probability of this case is 60/90 = 2/3.

Since the probability of Case 1 is 1 and the probability of Case 2 is 2/3, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
