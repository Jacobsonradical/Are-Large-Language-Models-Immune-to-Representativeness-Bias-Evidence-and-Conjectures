To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

This means there are 15 possible outcomes for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, is given by the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20

This means there are 20 possible outcomes for case 2.

Since there are more possible outcomes for case 2 than for case 1, we can conclude that there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
