To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(X = x) = n! / (x1! * x2! * x3!)

where n is the total number of balls (6), and x1, x2, x3 are the number of balls for children A, B, and C, respectively.

For case 1:
A:2, B:2, C:2
Probability = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15/90 = 1/6

For case 2:
A:2, B:3, C:1
Probability = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20/90 = 1/4.5

Since the probability of case 2 (1/4.5) is higher than the probability of case 1 (1/6), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
