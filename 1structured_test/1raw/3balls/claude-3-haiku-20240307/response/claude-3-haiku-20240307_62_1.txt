To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can analyze the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6 choose 2 ways to give 2 balls to A, 4 choose 2 ways to give 2 balls to B, and 2 choose 2 ways to give 2 balls to C. Therefore, the total number of ways to get case 1 is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 choose 2 ways to give 2 balls to A, 4 choose 3 ways to give 3 balls to B, and 1 choose 1 way to give 1 ball to C. Therefore, the total number of ways to get case 2 is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 5

The probability of case 1 is 15/20 = 0.75, and the probability of case 2 is 5/20 = 0.25.

Since the probability of case 1 is greater than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
