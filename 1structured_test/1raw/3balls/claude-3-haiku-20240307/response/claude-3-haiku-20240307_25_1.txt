To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

Let's consider the total number of possible ways the 6 balls can be distributed among the three children:
* Total number of possible distributions = 6C6 + 6C5 + 6C4 + 6C3 + 6C2 + 6C1 + 6C0 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
* The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case = 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
* Probability of case 1 = 90 / 64 = 45/32

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
* The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case = 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150
* Probability of case 2 = 150 / 64 = 75/32

Since the probability of case 2 (75/32) is higher than the probability of case 1 (45/32), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
