To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2, we need to consider the total number of possible distributions and the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the probability of this happening is 1/15 since there is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner.

For case 2, where child A and child B receive 2 and 3 balls, respectively, and child C receives 1 ball, the probability of this happening is 6/15 (6 ways to choose the 2 balls for child A, and then 5 ways to choose the 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C).

Therefore, the probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1, and in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

The answer in the requested format is:
{case: 2}
