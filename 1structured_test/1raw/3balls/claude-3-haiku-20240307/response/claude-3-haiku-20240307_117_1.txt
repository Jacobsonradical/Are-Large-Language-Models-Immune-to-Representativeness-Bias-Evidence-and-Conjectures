To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula.

The probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) is:

P(case 1) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

The probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is:

P(case 2) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 20/81

Since the probability of case 2 (20/81) is higher than the probability of case 1 (15/81), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
