To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

The probability of a specific distribution of balls among the three children is given by the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6! / (x! y! z!)) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls each child receives, and the total number of balls is 6.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Probability of this case = (6! / (2! 2! 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 20/729 ≈ 0.0274

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Probability of this case = (6! / (2! 3! 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 40/729 ≈ 0.0549

Since the probability of Case 2 (0.0549) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (0.0274), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
