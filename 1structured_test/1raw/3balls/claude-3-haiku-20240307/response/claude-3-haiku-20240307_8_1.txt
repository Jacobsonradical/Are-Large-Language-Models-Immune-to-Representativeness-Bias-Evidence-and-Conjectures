To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula.

For case 1:
Probability of case 1 = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2:
Probability of case 2 = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20

Since the probability of case 2 (20) is greater than the probability of case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
