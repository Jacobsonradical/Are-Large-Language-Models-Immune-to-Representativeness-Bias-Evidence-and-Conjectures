To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 15.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 20.

Since the number of possible distributions for Case 2 (20) is greater than the number of possible distributions for Case 1 (15), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
