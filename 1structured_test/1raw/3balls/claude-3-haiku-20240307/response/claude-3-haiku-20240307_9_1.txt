To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is 6! = 720.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring is higher than the probability of case 1 occurring.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
