To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

Given information:
- In each round, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

To calculate the probability of each case, we can use the concept of combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6! = 720.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as case 1 is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C, which is (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90.
The probability of case 1 is 90/720 = 1/8.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls as case 2 is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C, which is (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60.
The probability of case 2 is 60/720 = 5/60.

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that the probability of case 1 (1/8) is higher than the probability of case 2 (5/60).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
