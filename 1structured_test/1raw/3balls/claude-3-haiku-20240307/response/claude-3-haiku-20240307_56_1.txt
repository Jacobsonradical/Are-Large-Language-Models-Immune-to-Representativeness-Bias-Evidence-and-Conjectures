To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to analyze the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 3 = 15, as there are 6 choose 2 ways to select the 2 balls for each child, and 3 ways to assign them to the children.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 6C1 = 5, as there are 6 choose 2 ways to select the 2 balls for A, and 6 choose 1 way to select the 1 ball for C.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 is 15/20 = 0.75, and the probability of case 2 is 5/20 = 0.25.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
