To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children (A, B, C). The distribution of the balls among the children can be considered as a multinomial distribution.

The probability of each case can be calculated as follows:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The probability of this case is:
P(Case 1) = (6! / (2! 2! 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The probability of this case is:
P(Case 2) = (6! / (2! 3! 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 20/81

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that the probability of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

The answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2, 1 or 2}
