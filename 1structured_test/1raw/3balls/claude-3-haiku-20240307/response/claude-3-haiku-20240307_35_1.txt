To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of each case can be calculated using the combination formula:

Probability of Case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) / C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2)
Probability of Case 2 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) / C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1)

Where C(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r objects from a set of n objects.

Calculating the probabilities:
Probability of Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 / 15 × 6 × 1 = 1/5
Probability of Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 / 15 × 4 × 1 = 1/5

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, the number of results for Case 1 and Case 2 will be approximately equal in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1 or 2, 1}
