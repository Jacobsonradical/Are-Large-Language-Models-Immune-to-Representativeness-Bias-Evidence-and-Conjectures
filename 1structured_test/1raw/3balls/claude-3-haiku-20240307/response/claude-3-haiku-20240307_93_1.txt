To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children. The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 2, where child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball, the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20.

Since the number of ways to achieve case 2 is greater than the number of ways to achieve case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
