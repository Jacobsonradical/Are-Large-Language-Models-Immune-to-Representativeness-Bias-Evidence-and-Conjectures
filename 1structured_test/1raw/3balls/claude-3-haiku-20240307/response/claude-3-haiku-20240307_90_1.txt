To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children. The total number of possible distributions is 6C3 = 20, where 6C3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 balls.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3 = 15, where 6C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls for each child, and the multiplication by 3 accounts for the three possible permutations of the children.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3C1 = 5, where 6C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls for child A, and 3C1 represents the number of ways to choose 1 ball out of 3 balls for child C, with the multiplication by 3 accounting for the three possible permutations of the children.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
