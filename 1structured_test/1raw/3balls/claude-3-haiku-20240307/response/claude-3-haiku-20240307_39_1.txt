To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of getting a specific distribution of balls among the three children is given by the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6!) / (x! * y! * z!) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls each child receives, and the total number of balls is 6.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Probability of Case 1 = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Probability of Case 2 = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, in many rounds of the game, the number of results for Case 1 and Case 2 will be approximately the same. The difference, if any, will be due to the random nature of the distribution.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1 or 2, 1}
