To determine which case, 1 or 2, will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of the 6 balls among the three children (A, B, and C) can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula.

The multinomial distribution formula is:

P(X1 = x1, X2 = x2, ..., Xk = xk) = (n! / (x1! * x2! * ... * xk!)) * (p1^x1 * p2^x2 * ... * pk^xk)

Where:
- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of balls, which is 6)
- x1, x2, ..., xk are the number of successes for each outcome (in this case, the number of balls for each child)
- p1, p2, ..., pk are the probabilities of each outcome (in this case, the probability of each child receiving a ball, which is 1/3 for each child)

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Probability of this case = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 0.1852

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Probability of this case = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 0.2222

Since the probability of Case 2 (0.2222) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (0.1852), there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
