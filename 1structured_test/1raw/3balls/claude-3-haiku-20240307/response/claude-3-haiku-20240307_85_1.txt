To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible distributions for each case and the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children, and the order of the distribution does not matter. This means that we are dealing with a multinomial distribution problem.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The total number of possible distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 15

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The total number of possible distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 20

Since there are more possible distributions for Case 2 than for Case 1, the probability of Case 2 occurring is higher than the probability of Case 1 occurring.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.
