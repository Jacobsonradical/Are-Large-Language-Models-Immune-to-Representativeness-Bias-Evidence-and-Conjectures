To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of each case can be calculated using the concept of combinatorics.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! = 720.
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 3! = 6.
Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is:
Probability of case 1 = 6 / 720 = 1 / 120

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! = 720.
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is 3! = 6.
Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring is:
Probability of case 2 = 6 / 720 = 1 / 120

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal (1/120), there will be approximately the same number of results for case 1 and case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
