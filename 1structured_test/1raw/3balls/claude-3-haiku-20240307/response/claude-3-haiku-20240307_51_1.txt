To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Given:
- In each round, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

To calculate the probability of each case, we need to find the number of ways the balls can be distributed for each case and divide it by the total number of possible distributions.

The total number of possible distributions is the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, which is 6 choose 3 (6C3) = 20.

For case 1:
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15.
The probability of case 1 is 15/20 = 3/4.

For case 2:
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 5.
The probability of case 2 is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 is 3/4 and the probability of case 2 is 1/4, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, your answer}
