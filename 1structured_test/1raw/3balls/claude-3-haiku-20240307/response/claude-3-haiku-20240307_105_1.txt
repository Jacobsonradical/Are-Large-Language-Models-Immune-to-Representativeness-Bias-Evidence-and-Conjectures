To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case.

The probability of each case can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula.

The binomial distribution formula is given by:

P(X = k) = (n! / (k! * (n-k)!)) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- n is the total number of balls (6 in this case)
- k is the number of successes (the number of balls for a particular child)
- p is the probability of success (1/3 for each child)

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The probability of this case is:

P(A = 2, B = 2, C = 2) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6
= 15 * (1/3)^6
= 0.1111 or approximately 11.11%

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The probability of this case is:

P(A = 2, B = 3, C = 1) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6
= 20 * (1/3)^6
= 0.1481 or approximately 14.81%

Since the probability of case 2 (14.81%) is higher than the probability of case 1 (11.11%), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
