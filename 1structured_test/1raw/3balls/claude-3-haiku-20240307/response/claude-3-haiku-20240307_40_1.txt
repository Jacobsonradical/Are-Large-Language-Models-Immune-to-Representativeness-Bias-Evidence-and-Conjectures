To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20 (the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 balls).

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 × 5C3 × 1C1 = 5.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 0.75, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 0.25.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
