To determine which case is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probability of each case and compare them.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.

Since the number of possible distributions for Case 2 is greater than the number of possible distributions for Case 1, Case 2 is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
