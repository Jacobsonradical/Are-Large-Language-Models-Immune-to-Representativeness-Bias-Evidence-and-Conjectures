To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In each round of the game, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children. The total number of possible ways to distribute the balls is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15 ways to distribute the balls.
For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20 ways to distribute the balls.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1:
Probability of case 1 = 15/15 = 1
Probability of case 2 = 20/15 = 4/3

This means that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
