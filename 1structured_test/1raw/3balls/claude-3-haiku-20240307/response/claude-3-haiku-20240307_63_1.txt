To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of the 6 balls among the three children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6!) / (x! * y! * z!) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls each child receives.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
P(case 1) = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
P(case 2) = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 20/81

Since the probability of case 2 (20/81) is greater than the probability of case 1 (15/81), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
