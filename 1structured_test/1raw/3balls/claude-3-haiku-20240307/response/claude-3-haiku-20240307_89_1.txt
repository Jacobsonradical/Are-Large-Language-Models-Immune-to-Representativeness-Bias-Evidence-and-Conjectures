To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of getting a specific distribution of the 6 balls among the three children can be calculated using the multinomial probability formula.

The multinomial probability formula is:

P(X1 = x1, X2 = x2, ..., Xn = xn) = (n! / (x1! * x2! * ... * xn!)) * (p1^x1 * p2^x2 * ... * pn^xn)

Where:
- n is the total number of items (in this case, the 6 balls)
- x1, x2, ..., xn are the number of items assigned to each group (in this case, the number of balls assigned to each child)
- p1, p2, ..., pn are the probabilities of each group (in this case, the probabilities of each child receiving the balls)

Since the balls are distributed randomly, the probability of each child receiving any number of balls is equal, i.e., p1 = p2 = p3 = 1/3.

For case 1:
P(A:2, B:2, C:2) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 15/216 = 5/72

For case 2:
P(A:2, B:3, C:1) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 20/216 = 5/54

Since the probability of case 2 (5/54) is higher than the probability of case 1 (5/72), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
