To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

In case 1, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

In case 2, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since the number of possible outcomes for case 1 is 90 and the number of possible outcomes for case 2 is 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
