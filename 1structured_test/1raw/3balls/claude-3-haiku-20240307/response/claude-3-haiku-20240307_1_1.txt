To determine which case will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.

Since the probability of case 2 is higher (20/15 = 4/3), it will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
