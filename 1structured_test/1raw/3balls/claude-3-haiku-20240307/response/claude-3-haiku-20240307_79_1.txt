To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the combinatorics formula:

Probability = (number of ways to distribute the balls) / (total number of possible distributions)

The total number of possible distributions is 6C3 = 20, as we are distributing 6 balls among 3 children.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15.
The probability of case 1 is 15/20 = 3/4.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 5.
The probability of case 2 is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 (3/4) is greater than the probability of case 2 (1/4), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
