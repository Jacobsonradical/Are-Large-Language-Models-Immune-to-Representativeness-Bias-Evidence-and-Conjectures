To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among three children is 6^3 = 216.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
The probability of case 1 is 90/216 = 5/12.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls as 2-3-1 is 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.
The probability of case 2 is 60/216 = 5/18.

Since the probability of case 1 (5/12) is greater than the probability of case 2 (5/18), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2: 1}
