To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20, where 6C3 represents the combination of 6 balls taken 3 at a time.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 4C2 = 15, where 6C2 represents the combination of 2 balls taken from A, B, or C, and 4C2 represents the combination of 2 balls taken from the remaining 2 children.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 4C3 = 5, where 6C2 represents the combination of 2 balls taken from A, B, or C, and 4C3 represents the combination of 3 balls taken from the remaining 2 children.

The probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 0.75, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 0.25.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
