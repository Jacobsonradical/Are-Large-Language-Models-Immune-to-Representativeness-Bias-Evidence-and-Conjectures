To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6C2 × 5C2 × 4C2 = 15 × 10 × 6 = 900.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is 6C2 = 15.
The probability of case 1 is 15/900 = 1/60.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is still 900.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is 6C2 × 5C3 = 15 × 10 = 150.
The probability of case 2 is 150/900 = 1/6.

Since the probability of case 2 (1/6) is higher than the probability of case 1 (1/60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
