To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a particular distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6!) / (x! * y! * z!) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls each child receives, and the sum of x, y, and z must be 6.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
P(A:2, B:2, C:2) = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15 * (1/3)^6 = 0.1111

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
P(A:2, B:3, C:1) = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 20 * (1/3)^6 = 0.1481

The probability of case 2 (0.1481) is higher than the probability of case 1 (0.1111). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
