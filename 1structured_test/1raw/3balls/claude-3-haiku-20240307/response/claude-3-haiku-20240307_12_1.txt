To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to analyze the probability of each case occurring.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
For this case, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
6 choose 2 (for A) × 4 choose 2 (for B) × 2 choose 2 (for C) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90 ways.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
For this case, the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
6 choose 2 (for A) × 4 choose 3 (for B) × 1 choose 1 (for C) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60 ways.

The probability of case 1 occurring is 90 / (90 + 60) = 0.6, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 60 / (90 + 60) = 0.4.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, answer: 1}
