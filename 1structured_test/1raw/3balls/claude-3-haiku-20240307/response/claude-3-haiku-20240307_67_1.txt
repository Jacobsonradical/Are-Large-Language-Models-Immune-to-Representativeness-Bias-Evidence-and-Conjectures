To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 is 3! = 6.
Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 6/20 = 3/10.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is 3!/(1!2!) = 9.
Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring is 9/20.

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is more likely to occur than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
