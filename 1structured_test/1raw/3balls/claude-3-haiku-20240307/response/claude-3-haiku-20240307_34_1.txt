To determine which case (1 or 2) will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, the 6 balls are distributed equally among the three children, with each child receiving 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in this manner is given by the binomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15

This is because we first need to choose 2 balls for child A, then 2 balls for child B, and finally, the remaining 2 balls will go to child C.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, the 6 balls are distributed unevenly among the three children, with child B receiving 3 balls, child A receiving 2 balls, and child C receiving 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in this manner is given by the binomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 60

This is because we first need to choose 2 balls for child A, then 3 balls for child B, and finally, the remaining 1 ball will go to child C.

Comparing the number of possible outcomes for each case, we can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 (60 ways) than in Case 1 (15 ways). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.
