To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children, and each distribution is equally likely.

The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6 choose 2 ways to distribute the balls to A, 4 choose 2 ways to distribute the balls to B, and 2 choose 2 ways to distribute the balls to C. Therefore, there are (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 possible distributions of case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 choose 2 ways to distribute the balls to A, 4 choose 3 ways to distribute the balls to B, and 1 choose 1 way to distribute the balls to C. Therefore, there are (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 5 possible distributions of case 2.

Since there are more possible distributions for case 1 (15) than for case 2 (5), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
