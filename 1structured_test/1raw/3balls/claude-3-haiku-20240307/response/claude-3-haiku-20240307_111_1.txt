To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among three children (A, B, C) can be calculated using the multinomial probability formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6!) / (x! * y! * z!) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z represent the number of balls received by A, B, and C, respectively.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
P(A:2, B:2, C:2) = (6!) / (2! * 2! * 2!) * (1/3)^6 = 15 * (1/3)^6 = 0.0617 or approximately 6.17%

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
P(A:2, B:3, C:1) = (6!) / (2! * 3! * 1!) * (1/3)^6 = 20 * (1/3)^6 = 0.0823 or approximately 8.23%

The probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
