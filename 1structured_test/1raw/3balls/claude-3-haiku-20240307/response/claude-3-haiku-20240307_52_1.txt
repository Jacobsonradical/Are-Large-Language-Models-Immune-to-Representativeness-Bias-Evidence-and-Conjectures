To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of possible distributions is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of possible distributions is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 10.

Since the number of possible distributions for case 1 is greater than the number of possible distributions for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
