To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In each round, the balls are distributed randomly among the three children. The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to A, 4 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to B, and 2 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to C. This gives us a total of 6 * 4 * 2 = 48 possible distributions for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to A, 4 choose 3 ways to assign the balls to B, and 1 choose 1 way to assign the ball to C. This gives us a total of 6 * 4 * 1 = 24 possible distributions for case 2.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 48/20 = 12/5, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 24/20 = 6/5.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
