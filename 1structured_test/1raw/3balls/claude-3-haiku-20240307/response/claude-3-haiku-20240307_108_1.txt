To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can calculate the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is equal to the number of ways to distribute the balls divided by the total number of possible distributions.

The total number of possible distributions is 6! (6 factorial) = 720, as there are 6 balls that can be distributed in any order.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.
The probability of case 1 is 15 / 720 = 1/48.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.
The probability of case 2 is 20 / 720 = 5/180.

The probability of case 2 (5/180) is higher than the probability of case 1 (1/48). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
