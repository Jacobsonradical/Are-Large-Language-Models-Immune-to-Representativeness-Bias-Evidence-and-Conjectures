To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children and the relative probability of each case.

The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6C3 = 20, as we have 6 balls and we are choosing 3 balls for one child (the remaining 3 balls will be distributed among the other two children).

Now, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 4C2 = 15, as we have 6 balls and we are choosing 2 balls for each child.

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 5C3 = 5, as we have 6 balls and we are choosing 2 balls for the first child, and 3 balls for the second child.

Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of Case 2 is 5/20 = 1/4.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
