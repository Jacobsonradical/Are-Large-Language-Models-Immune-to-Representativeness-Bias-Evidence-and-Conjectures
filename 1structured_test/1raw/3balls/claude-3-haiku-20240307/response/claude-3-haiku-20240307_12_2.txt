To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 possible ways to distribute the balls.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20 possible ways to distribute the balls.

Since there are more possible ways to distribute the balls in case 2, it is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
