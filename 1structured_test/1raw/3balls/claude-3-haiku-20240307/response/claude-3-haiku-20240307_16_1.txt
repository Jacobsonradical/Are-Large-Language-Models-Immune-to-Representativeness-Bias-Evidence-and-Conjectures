To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to analyze the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 ways to distribute the balls in this manner.

The probability of case 1 occurring is 1/15, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 6/15.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

The answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
