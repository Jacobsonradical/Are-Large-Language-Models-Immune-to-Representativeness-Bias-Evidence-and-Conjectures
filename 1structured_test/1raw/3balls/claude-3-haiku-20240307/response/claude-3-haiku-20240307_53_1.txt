To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In each round, the balls are distributed at random among the three children. The probability of each case occurring can be calculated using the concept of combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children such that each child gets 2 balls is:
6!/(2!2!2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball is:
6!/(2!3!1!) = 20

Since the number of ways to get case 2 (20) is greater than the number of ways to get case 1 (15), the probability of case 2 occurring is higher.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

The answer in the requested format is:
{case: 2}
