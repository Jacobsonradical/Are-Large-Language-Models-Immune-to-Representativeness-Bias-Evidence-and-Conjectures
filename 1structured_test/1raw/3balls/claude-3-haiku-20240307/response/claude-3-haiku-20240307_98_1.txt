To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

Probability of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.
Out of these 15 possible distributions, only one distribution results in Case 1.
Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 1/15 = 0.0667 or approximately 6.67%.

Probability of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.
Out of these 20 possible distributions, only one distribution results in Case 2.
Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is 1/20 = 0.05 or 5%.

Since the probability of Case 1 (6.67%) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (5%), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
