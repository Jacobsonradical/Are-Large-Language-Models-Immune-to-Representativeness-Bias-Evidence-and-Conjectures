To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children, A, B, and C. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

This is the total number of possible outcomes.

Now, let's calculate the number of outcomes for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:
C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since the number of outcomes for Case 1 is 90, and the number of outcomes for Case 2 is 60, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
