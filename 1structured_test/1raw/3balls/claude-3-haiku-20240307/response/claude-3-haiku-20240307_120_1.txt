To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20 (the number of combinations of 6 balls taken 3 at a time).

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3C2 = 15 (the number of combinations of 2 balls taken from each child).

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 3C3 × 3C1 = 20 (the number of combinations of 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C).

Since there are 20 possible ways to distribute the balls in case 2 and only 15 possible ways in case 1, the probability of obtaining case 2 is higher than the probability of obtaining case 1.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
