To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20.

Since the probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
