To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3! = 15.
The probability of this case occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 * 3C1 = 5.
The probability of this case occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 (3/4) is higher than the probability of case 2 (1/4), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
