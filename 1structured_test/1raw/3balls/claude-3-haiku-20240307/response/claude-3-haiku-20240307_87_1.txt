To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

Let's consider the total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children:
- Total number of ways = 6C6 + 6C5 + 6C4 + 6C3 + 6C2 + 6C1 + 6C0 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
The probability of this case is 90/64 ≈ 0.1406 or approximately 14.06%.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150.
The probability of this case is 150/64 ≈ 0.2344 or approximately 23.44%.

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
