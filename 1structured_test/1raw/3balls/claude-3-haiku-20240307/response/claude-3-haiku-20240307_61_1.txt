To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Given:
- 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
- Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1

The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2), there is only one way to achieve this distribution.

For Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1), there are 6 ways to achieve this distribution (6 choose 3 for the balls given to B).

Therefore, the probability of Case 2 occurring is 6/15 = 2/5, which is greater than the probability of Case 1 occurring, which is 1/15.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Answer:
{case: 2}
