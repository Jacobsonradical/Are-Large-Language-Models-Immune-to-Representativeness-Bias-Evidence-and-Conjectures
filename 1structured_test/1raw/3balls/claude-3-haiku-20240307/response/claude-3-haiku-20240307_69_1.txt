To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20, where 6C3 represents the number of combinations of 3 objects chosen from 6 objects.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15, where each 6C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to achieve this distribution is 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 5, where 6C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls for child A, 6C3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and 6C1 represents the number of ways to choose 1 ball for child C.

The probability of case 1 is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of case 2 is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
