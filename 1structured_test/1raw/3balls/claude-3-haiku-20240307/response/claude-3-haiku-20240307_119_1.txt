To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is 6C2 × 5C3 × 1C1 = 5.

Therefore, the probability of Case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of Case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

The answer in the requested format is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2}
