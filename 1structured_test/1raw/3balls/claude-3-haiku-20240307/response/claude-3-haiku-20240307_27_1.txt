To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6C2 × 5C2 × 4C2 = 15 × 10 × 6 = 900.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 × 5C2 × 4C2 = 15 × 10 × 6 = 900.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 900/900 = 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 × 5C3 × 4C1 = 15 × 10 × 4 = 600.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 600/900 = 2/3.

Since the probability of case 1 occurring is higher than the probability of case 2 occurring, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
