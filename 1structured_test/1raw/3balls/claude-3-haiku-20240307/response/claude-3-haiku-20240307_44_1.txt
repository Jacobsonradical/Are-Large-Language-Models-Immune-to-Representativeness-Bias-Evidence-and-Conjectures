To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

Let's calculate the probability of each case occurring:

Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children in this case is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is 6C6 = 720.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 90/720 = 5/40 = 1/8.

Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children in this case is 6C2 * 4C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.
The total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is 6C6 = 720.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 60/720 = 5/60 = 1/12.

Since the probability of case 1 (1/8) is greater than the probability of case 2 (1/12), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
