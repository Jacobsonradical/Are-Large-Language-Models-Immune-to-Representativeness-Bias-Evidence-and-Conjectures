To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15 for case 1
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 10 for case 2

The probability of each case is proportional to the number of ways to distribute the balls:

P(case 1) = 15 / 25 = 0.6
P(case 2) = 10 / 25 = 0.4

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{case: 1}
