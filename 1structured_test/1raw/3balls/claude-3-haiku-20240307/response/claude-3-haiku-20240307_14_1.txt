To determine whether there will be more results of Case 1 or Case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to analyze the probability of each case occurring.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children (A, B, and C). The number of ways to distribute the balls is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are 6 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to each child, which is 15. Therefore, the probability of Case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4.

For Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 choose 2 ways to assign the balls to A, 5 choose 3 ways to assign the balls to B, and 2 choose 1 way to assign the balls to C, which is 15 × 10 × 2 = 300. Therefore, the probability of Case 2 occurring is 300/20 = 3/2.

Since the probability of Case 2 occurring is higher than the probability of Case 1 occurring, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
