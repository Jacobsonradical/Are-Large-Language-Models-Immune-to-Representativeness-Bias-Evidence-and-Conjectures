To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20, as we are choosing 3 out of 6 balls for each child.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15, as we need to choose 2 balls for each child.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 5, as we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 1/4.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
