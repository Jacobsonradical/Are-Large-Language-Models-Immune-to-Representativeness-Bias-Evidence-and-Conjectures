To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

In each round, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C. The number of ways to distribute the balls among the children is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

This means that there are 15 possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.

Now, let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This case corresponds to one of the 15 possible distributions. The number of ways to achieve this distribution is 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This case also corresponds to one of the 15 possible distributions. The number of ways to achieve this distribution is 1.

Since both cases have an equal number of possible distributions (1 each), the frequency of occurrence of these two cases will be the same in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1 or 2, 1}

This means that in many rounds of the game, there will be as many results of case 1 as there will be of case 2.
