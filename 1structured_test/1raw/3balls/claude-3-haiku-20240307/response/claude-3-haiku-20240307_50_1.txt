To determine which case (case 1 or case 2) will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner, so the probability of this case is 1/15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 6 ways to distribute the balls in this manner, so the probability of this case is 6/15.

Since the probability of case 2 (6/15) is greater than the probability of case 1 (1/15), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
