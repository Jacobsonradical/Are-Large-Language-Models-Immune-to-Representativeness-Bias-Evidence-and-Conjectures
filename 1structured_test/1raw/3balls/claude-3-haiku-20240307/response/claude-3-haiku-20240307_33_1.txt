To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible ways the balls can be distributed in each case.

In case 1, the balls are distributed evenly among the three children, with each child receiving 2 balls. The total number of possible outcomes for case 1 is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child, which can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15

In case 2, the balls are distributed unevenly, with child A and child B receiving 2 and 3 balls, respectively, while child C receives only 1 ball. The total number of possible outcomes for case 2 can be calculated as:

(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 60

Since there are 60 possible outcomes for case 2 and only 15 possible outcomes for case 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
