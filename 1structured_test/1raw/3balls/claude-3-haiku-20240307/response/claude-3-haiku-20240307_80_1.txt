To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

For each round, the probability of a specific distribution of the 6 balls among the three children is equal for all possible distributions, as the balls are distributed at random.

The total number of possible distributions is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15 for case 1 and 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20 for case 2.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 15/35, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 20/35.

Since the probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

The answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
