To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20 (the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of 6 balls).

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15. This is because there are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for each child.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 5. This is because there are 6C2 ways to choose 2 balls for A, 6C3 ways to choose 3 balls for B, and 6C1 ways to choose 1 ball for C.

The probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 0.75, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 5/20 = 0.25.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
