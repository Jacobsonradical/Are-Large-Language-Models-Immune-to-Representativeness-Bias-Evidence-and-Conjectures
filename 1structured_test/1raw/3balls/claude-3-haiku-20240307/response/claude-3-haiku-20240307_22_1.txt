To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability and combinatorics.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed randomly among the three children, A, B, and C. The probability of each possible distribution can be calculated using the following formula:

P(distribution) = (6! / (2! 2! 2!)) / 3^6 for case 1, and
P(distribution) = (6! / (2! 3! 1!)) / 3^6 for case 2

Where 6! represents the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls, and the numerator represents the number of ways to distribute the balls in the specific case.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(case 1) = (6! / (2! 2! 2!)) / 3^6 = 15/216 = 5/72
P(case 2) = (6! / (2! 3! 1!)) / 3^6 = 20/216 = 5/54

The probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1, so in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
