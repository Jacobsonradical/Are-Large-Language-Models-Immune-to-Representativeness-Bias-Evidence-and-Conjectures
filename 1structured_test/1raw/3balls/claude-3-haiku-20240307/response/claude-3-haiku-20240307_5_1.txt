To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the total number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the total number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150.

Since the number of possible distributions for case 2 is larger than the number of possible distributions for case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
