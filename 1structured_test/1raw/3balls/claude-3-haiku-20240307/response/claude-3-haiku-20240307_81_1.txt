To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial distribution formula:

P(A:x, B:y, C:z) = (6! / (x! * y! * z!)) * (1/3)^6

where x, y, and z are the number of balls distributed to children A, B, and C, respectively.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Probability of case 1 = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81 ≈ 0.185

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Probability of case 2 = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 20/81 ≈ 0.247

The probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
