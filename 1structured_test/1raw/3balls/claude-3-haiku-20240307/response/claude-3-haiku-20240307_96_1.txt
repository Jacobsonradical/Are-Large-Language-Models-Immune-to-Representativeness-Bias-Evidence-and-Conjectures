To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

The probability of each case occurring can be calculated as follows:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3, which is 20. The number of ways to distribute the balls as 2-2-2 is 3 choose 2, which is 3. Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 3/20 = 0.15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible distributions is still 20. The number of ways to distribute the balls as 2-3-1 is 3 choose 2, which is 3. Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is also 3/20 = 0.15.

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, the number of results for each case will be approximately the same in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2}
