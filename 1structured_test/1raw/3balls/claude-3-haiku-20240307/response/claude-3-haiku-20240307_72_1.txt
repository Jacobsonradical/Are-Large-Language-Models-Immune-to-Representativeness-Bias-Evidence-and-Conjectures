To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics.

In this game, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C. The order in which the balls are distributed matters, as each child's set of balls is considered distinct.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is:
6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is:
6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 20

Since the number of possible distributions for case 2 (20) is greater than the number of possible distributions for case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
