To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach to calculate the probability of each case and then compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, the balls are distributed equally among the three children.
The number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for each child.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is: (6 choose 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for B is: (4 choose 2) = 6.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for C is: (2 choose 2) = 1.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, the balls are distributed unevenly among the three children.
The number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is: (6 choose 2) = 15.
The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B is: (4 choose 3) = 4.
The number of ways to choose 1 ball for C is: (1 choose 1) = 1.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is: 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Comparing the two cases, we can see that there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90 ways) than in Case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
