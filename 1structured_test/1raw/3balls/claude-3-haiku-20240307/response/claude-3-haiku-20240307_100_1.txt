To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible ways to distribute the balls is 6! = 720.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls for this case is:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20

Since the number of possible ways to distribute the balls for Case 2 is greater than the number of ways for Case 1, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
