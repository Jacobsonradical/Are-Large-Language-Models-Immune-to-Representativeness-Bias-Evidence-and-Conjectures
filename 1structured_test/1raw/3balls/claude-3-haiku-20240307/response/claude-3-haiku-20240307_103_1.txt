To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In this game, there are 6 distinguishable balls that are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the number of possible ways to distribute the balls is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

For case 2, where A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball, the number of possible ways to distribute the balls is given by:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the number of possible ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) is greater than the number of possible ways in case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
