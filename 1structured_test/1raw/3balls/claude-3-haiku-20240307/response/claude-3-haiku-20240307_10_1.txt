To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.

Since the number of ways to distribute the balls for case 2 is greater than the number of ways for case 1, case 2 will have more results in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
