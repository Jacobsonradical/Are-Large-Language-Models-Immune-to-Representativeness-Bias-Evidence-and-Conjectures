To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and compare them.

The probability of a specific distribution of 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated as follows:

Probability = (number of ways to distribute the balls) / (total number of possible distributions)

The total number of possible distributions is 6! (6 factorial), as there are 6 balls to be distributed.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways to distribute the balls:
- Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
- Choose 2 balls for B: 4C2 = 6
- The remaining 2 balls go to C

Total number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 1 = 15 * 6 = 90

Probability of Case 1 = 90 / 6! = 5/45 = 1/5

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways to distribute the balls:
- Choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
- Choose 3 balls for B: 4C3 = 4
- The remaining 1 ball goes to C

Total number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2 = 15 * 4 = 60

Probability of Case 2 = 60 / 6! = 1/3

Since the probability of Case 2 (1/3) is greater than the probability of Case 1 (1/5), there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
