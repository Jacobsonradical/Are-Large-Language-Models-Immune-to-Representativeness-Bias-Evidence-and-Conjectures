To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinations and probabilities.

In each round, we have 6 distinguishable balls to be distributed among the three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The probability of this case occurring in a single round is the number of ways to distribute the balls divided by the total number of possible distributions.

The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3 (6C3), which is 6!/(3!*3!) = 20.

The number of ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:2, C:2 is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring in a single round is 15/20 = 3/4.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The probability of this case occurring in a single round is the number of ways to distribute the balls divided by the total number of possible distributions.

The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3 (6C3), which is 6!/(3!*3!) = 20.

The number of ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1 is 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 5.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring in a single round is 5/20 = 1/4.

Conclusion:
In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 because the probability of case 1 occurring is higher (3/4) compared to the probability of case 2 occurring (1/4).
