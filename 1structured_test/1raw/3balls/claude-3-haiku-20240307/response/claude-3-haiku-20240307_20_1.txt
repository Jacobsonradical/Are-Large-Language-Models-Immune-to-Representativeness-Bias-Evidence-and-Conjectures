To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

Let's first calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Total number of possible distributions: 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90
Probability of Case 1: 1/90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Total number of possible distributions: 6C2 * 5C3 * 1C1 = 15 * 10 * 1 = 150
Probability of Case 2: 1/150

Since the probability of Case 2 is higher than the probability of Case 1, there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
