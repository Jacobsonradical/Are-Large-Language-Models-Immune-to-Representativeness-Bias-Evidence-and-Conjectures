To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.

In case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 15.

In case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 20.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 occurring is higher than the probability of case 1 occurring.

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

Answer: {case: 2}
