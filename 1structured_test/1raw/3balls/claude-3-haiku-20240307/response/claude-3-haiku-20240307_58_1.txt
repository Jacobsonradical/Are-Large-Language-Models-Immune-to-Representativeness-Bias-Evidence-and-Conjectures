To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The probability of each case can be calculated using the concept of combinations from probability theory.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is 6! = 720.
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 6C2 × 6C2 × 6C2 = 15 × 15 × 15 = 3,375.
The probability of case 1 occurring is 3,375 / 720 = 0.4687.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is 6C2 × 6C3 × 6C1 = 15 × 20 × 6 = 1,800.
The probability of case 2 occurring is 1,800 / 720 = 0.25.

Comparing the probabilities, we can see that case 1 has a higher probability of occurring than case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
