To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6C3 = 20 (6 choose 3, since the order of the balls doesn't matter).

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 4C2 = 15 (6 choose 2 for the first child, then 4 choose 2 for the second child).

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6C2 * 5C3 = 10 (6 choose 2 for the first child, then 5 choose 3 for the second child).

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 15/20 = 3/4, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 10/20 = 1/2.

Since the probability of case 1 is higher than the probability of case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
