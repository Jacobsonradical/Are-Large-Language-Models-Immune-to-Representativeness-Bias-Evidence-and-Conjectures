To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways the balls can be distributed in each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in this case is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in this case is:
(6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 1 (90) than in Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
