To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls in this case is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more possible ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) compared to case 2 (60), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2: 1}
