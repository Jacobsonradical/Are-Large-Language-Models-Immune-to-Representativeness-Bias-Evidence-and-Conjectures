To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the number of combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time for each child, which can be calculated as:

Combinations of 2 balls taken from 6 for A = 6C2 = 15
Combinations of 2 balls taken from the remaining 4 for B = 4C2 = 6
Combinations of 2 balls taken from the remaining 2 for C = 2C2 = 1

Total number of possible outcomes for case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the number of combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time for A, 3 at a time for B, and 1 at a time for C, which can be calculated as:

Combinations of 2 balls taken from 6 for A = 6C2 = 15
Combinations of 3 balls taken from the remaining 4 for B = 4C3 = 4
Combinations of 1 ball taken from the remaining 1 for C = 1C1 = 1

Total number of possible outcomes for case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Based on the calculations, there are more possible outcomes for case 1 (90) than for case 2 (60). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
