To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3, which is 20.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:2, C:2 is 6 choose 2, 4 choose 2, 2 choose 2, which is 15.
Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 15/20 = 3/4.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 3, which is 20.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1 is 6 choose 2, 4 choose 3, 1 choose 1, which is 15.
Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is 15/20 = 3/4.

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, in many rounds of the game, the results of Case 1 and Case 2 will be equally likely to occur.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
