To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.
Out of these 15 possible distributions, only one distribution results in Case 1.
Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is 1/15 = 0.0667 or approximately 6.67%.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 20.
Out of these 20 possible distributions, only one distribution results in Case 2.
Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is 1/20 = 0.05 or 5%.

Since the probability of Case 1 (6.67%) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (5%), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1, 1 or 2}
