To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

In this game, we have 6 distinguishable balls that are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The probability of this case occurring can be calculated as follows:
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 6 choose 2, 6 choose 2, and 6 choose 2, respectively.
The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 6.
Therefore, the probability of Case 1 is:
(6 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) / (6 choose 6) = 15 / 20 = 3/4

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The probability of this case occurring can be calculated as follows:
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is 6 choose 2, 6 choose 3, and 6 choose 1, respectively.
The total number of possible distributions is 6 choose 6.
Therefore, the probability of Case 2 is:
(6 choose 2) * (6 choose 3) * (6 choose 1) / (6 choose 6) = 15 / 20 = 3/4

Since the probabilities of both cases are equal, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be an equal number of results for Case 1 and Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1 or 2, 1}
