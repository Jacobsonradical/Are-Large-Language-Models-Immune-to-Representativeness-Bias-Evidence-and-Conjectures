To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
(6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 20.

Since the number of possible ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (20) is greater than the number of possible ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
