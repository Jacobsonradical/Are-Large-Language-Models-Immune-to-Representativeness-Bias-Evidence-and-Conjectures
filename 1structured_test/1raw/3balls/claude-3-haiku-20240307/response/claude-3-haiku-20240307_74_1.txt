To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of probability.

In this game, the distribution of the 6 balls among the three children (A, B, C) can be considered as a multinomial distribution problem.

The probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) can be calculated as:

P(case 1) = (6! / (2! * 2! * 2!)) * (1/3)^6 = 15/81

The probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) can be calculated as:

P(case 2) = (6! / (2! * 3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^6 = 10/81

Since the probability of case 1 (15/81) is greater than the probability of case 2 (10/81), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1, 1}
