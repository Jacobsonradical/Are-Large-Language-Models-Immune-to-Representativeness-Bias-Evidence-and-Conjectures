To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6 choose 3, which is 20.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, the number of possible distributions is 3 choose 2, which is 3. This is because there are 3 ways to choose which 2 children get the first 2 balls, and the third child will automatically get the remaining 2 balls.

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the number of possible distributions is 3 choose 1, which is 3. This is because there are 3 ways to choose which child gets the 3 balls, and the remaining 2 children will automatically get the remaining balls.

Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is 3/20, and the probability of case 2 occurring is 3/20.

Since the probabilities are equal, in many rounds of the game, there will be approximately the same number of results for case 1 and case 2.
