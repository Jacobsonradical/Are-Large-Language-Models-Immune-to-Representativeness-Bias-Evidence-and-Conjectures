To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 or case 2 in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the number of possible ways the balls can be distributed for each case.

For case 1, where each child receives 2 balls, the total number of possible distributions is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child, which can be calculated using the combination formula:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 possible distributions

For case 2, where child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball, the total number of possible distributions is the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and 1 ball out of the remaining 1 ball for child C, which can be calculated as:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 possible distributions

Since there are 90 possible distributions for case 1 and only 60 possible distributions for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 1}
