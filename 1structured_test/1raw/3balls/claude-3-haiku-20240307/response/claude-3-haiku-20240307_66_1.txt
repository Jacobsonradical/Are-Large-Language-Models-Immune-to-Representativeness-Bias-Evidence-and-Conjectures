To determine which case will have more results in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case occurring.

Let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The total number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 4C2 * 2C2 = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 is 1.
The probability of this case is 1/90 = 0.0111 or 1.11%.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The total number of possible distributions is 6C2 * 4C3 * 2C1 = 15 * 4 * 2 = 120.
The number of ways to get the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 is 10.
The probability of this case is 10/120 = 0.0833 or 8.33%.

Since the probability of Case 2 (8.33%) is higher than the probability of Case 1 (1.11%), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
