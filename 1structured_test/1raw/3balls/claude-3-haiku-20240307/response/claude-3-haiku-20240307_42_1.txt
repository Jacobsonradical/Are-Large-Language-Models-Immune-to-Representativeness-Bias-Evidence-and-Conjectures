To determine which case (1 or 2) will occur more often in many rounds of the game, we need to consider the probability of each case.

The total number of possible distributions of the 6 balls among the three children is 6!/(2!2!2!) = 15.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only one possible distribution out of the 15 total distributions.
For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are 3 possible distributions out of the 15 total distributions.

Therefore, the probability of case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) is higher than the probability of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{case: 2}
