To determine whether there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.

In each round, the 6 balls are distributed at random among the three children. The number of possible ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Now, let's calculate the probability of each case:

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The probability of this case is the number of ways to distribute the balls in this configuration divided by the total number of possible distributions:
Probability of case 1 = 1 / 15

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The probability of this case is the number of ways to distribute the balls in this configuration divided by the total number of possible distributions:
Probability of case 2 = 6 / 15 = 2 / 5

Since the probability of case 2 (2/5) is greater than the probability of case 1 (1/15), there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
