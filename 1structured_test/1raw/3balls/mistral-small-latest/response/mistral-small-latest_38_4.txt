{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute 6 balls into the groups A:2, B:3, C:1 than into A:2, B:2, C:2. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient, which for case 1 is C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 900 and for case 2 is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 1500. Since 1500 > 900, there will be more results of case 2.}
