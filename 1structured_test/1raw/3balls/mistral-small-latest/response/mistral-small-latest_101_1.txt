The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method, which is a way to count the number of ways to put k identical objects into n distinct containers.

In this case, we have 6 balls (stars) and 2 separators (bars) to divide them into 3 groups for A, B, and C. So, the total number of objects is 8 (6 stars + 2 bars). The number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose the positions of the 2 separators in the 8 possible positions, which is C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose the positions of the 2 separators for A and B's balls from the 5 possible positions, which is C(5, 2) = 10.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose the positions of the 2 separators for A's balls from the 4 possible positions, which is C(4, 2) = 6.

Since 10 (case 1) > 6 (case 2), there will be more results of case 1.

Therefore, the answer is: {case: 1}
