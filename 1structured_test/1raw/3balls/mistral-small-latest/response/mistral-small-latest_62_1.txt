{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is equal to the combination C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children. In this case, it is C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls is equal to the number of permutations of 2A, 2B, and 2C, which is 3!/2!2!2! = 3.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is equal to the number of permutations of 2A, 3B, and 1C, which is 3!/2!1! = 6.

Since 6 > 3, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
