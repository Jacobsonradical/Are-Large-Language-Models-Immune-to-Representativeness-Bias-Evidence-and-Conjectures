{case: 2}

To reason, we need to calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that each has 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Since 360 > 90, there will be more results of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) in many rounds of the game.
