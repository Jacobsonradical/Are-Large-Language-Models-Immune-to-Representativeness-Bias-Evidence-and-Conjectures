The answer is {case: 2}.

This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls such that the result is case 2 than case 1.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2, one child gets 3 balls, another gets 2, and the last one gets 1. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 3, 2, 1) = 6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
