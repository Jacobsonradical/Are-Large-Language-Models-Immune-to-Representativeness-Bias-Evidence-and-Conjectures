{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:

Assuming that each distribution of balls is equally likely, we can calculate the number of ways to achieve each case using combinations.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 (600) than case 1 (270), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
