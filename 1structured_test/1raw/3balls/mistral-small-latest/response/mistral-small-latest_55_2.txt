{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In each round of the game, the 6 balls can be distributed among the three children in a number of different ways. The total number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated using the stars and bars method, which is a combination problem. The number of combinations is given by C(n+k-1, k-1), where n is the number of balls and k is the number of children. In this case, n=6 and k=3, so there are C(8,2) = 28 possible distributions of the balls.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. There is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner.

In case 2, the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1. There are 3 ways to distribute the balls in this manner (since the ball that child C gets can be any one of the 6 balls).

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, and the total number of possible distributions is fixed, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
