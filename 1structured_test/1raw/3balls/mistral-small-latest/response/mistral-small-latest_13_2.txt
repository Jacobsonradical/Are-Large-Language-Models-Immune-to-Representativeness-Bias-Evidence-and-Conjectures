{case: 2}

There are a total of 20 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, if we consider all distributions as distinct (i.e., order matters). These distributions can be represented as triples, such as (2,2,2), (2,3,1), etc.

In case 1, there is only 1 distribution that matches the pattern (2,2,2), which is equivalent to choosing 2 balls out of 6 for each child.

In case 2, there are 6 distributions that match the pattern (2,3,1), which can be calculated using combinations:
C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 / 3! = 6 (since the order of children does not matter, and we divide by 3! to correct for overcounting)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
