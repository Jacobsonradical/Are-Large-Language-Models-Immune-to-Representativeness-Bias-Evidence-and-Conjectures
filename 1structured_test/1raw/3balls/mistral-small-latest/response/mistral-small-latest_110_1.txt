{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 0) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 0!) = 90
for case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600
for case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1

Since 600 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
