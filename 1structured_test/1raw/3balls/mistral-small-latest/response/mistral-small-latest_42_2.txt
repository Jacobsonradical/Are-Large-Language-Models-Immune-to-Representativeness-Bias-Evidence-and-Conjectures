{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. The reasoning behind this is that case 2 has more possible combinations than case 1.

For case 1, there are C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways to distribute the balls equally among the three children. (Here C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.)

For case 2, there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1.

Since 90 < 60 * 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
