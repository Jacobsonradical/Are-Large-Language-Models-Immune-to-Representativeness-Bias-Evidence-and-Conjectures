{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method or combinations with repetitions. The total number of distributions is C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. There is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case.

For case 2, we have A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(5,1) = 5.

Since 5 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
