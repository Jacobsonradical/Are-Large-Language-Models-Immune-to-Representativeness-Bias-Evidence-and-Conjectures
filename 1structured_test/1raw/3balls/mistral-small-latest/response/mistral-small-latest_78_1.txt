The distribution of the balls follows a multinomial distribution. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children can be calculated using combinations.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls as in case 1, we would expect more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
