{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

The number of ways to distribute the balls is determined by the combinations of choosing balls for each child.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270.

For case 2, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3, and the last one gets 1. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
