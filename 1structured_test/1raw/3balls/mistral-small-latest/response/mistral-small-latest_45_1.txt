{case: 2, Since case 2 has more possible distributions (C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60) than case 1 (C(6,2) * C(4,2) / 2! = 15 * 6 / 2 = 45), there will be more results of case 2. The division by 2! in case 1 is because the distribution of 2 balls to A and 2 balls to B is considered the same as the distribution of 2 balls to B and 2 balls to A.}
