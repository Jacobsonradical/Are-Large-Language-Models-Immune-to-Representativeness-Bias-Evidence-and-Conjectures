The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions, or stars and bars method.

The total number of distributions is C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, A:2, B:2, C:2, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls.
For case 2, A:2, B:3, C:1, there are C(5,1) = 5 ways to distribute the balls (since B gets one extra ball).

Since 5 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, {case: 2}
