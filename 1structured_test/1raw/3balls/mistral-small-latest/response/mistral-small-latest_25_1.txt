{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

The number of ways to distribute the balls among the children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways to place n items into k groups with specified counts for each group.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game. Therefore, the answer is case 2.
