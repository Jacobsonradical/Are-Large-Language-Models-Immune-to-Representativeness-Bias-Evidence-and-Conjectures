{case: 2}

Reasoning:
In this problem, we need to find out which case will occur more frequently. Both case 1 and case 2 involve distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children.

The total number of distributions for 6 balls into 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!)

where n is the total number of balls, n1, n2, and n3 are the numbers of balls given to children A, B, and C, respectively.

For case 1, we have n1=n2=n3=2, so the number of distributions is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2, we have n1=2, n2=3, and n3=1, so the number of distributions is:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 630

Since 630 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
