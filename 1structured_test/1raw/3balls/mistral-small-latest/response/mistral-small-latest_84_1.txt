{case: 2}

There are a total of 20 distinguishable outcomes when distributing 6 balls among 3 children (using stars and bars method, or simply listing all possibilities).

Case 1 has only 1 possible outcome (A:2, B:2, C:2), while case 2 has 6 possible outcomes (A:2, B:3, C:1), (A:2, B:1, C:3), (A:3, B:2, C:1), (A:1, B:3, C:2), (A:3, B:1, C:2), and (A:1, B:2, C:3).

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
