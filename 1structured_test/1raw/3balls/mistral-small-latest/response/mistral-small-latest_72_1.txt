{case: 2, The probability of case 2 occurring is higher than case 1. This is because case 2 allows for more possible distributions of balls than case 1. Case 1 requires an exact distribution of 2 balls to each child, which is a single outcome. Case 2 allows for multiple distributions (e.g., A:2, B:3, C:1 or A:3, B:2, C:1), which are more than the single outcome of case 1.}
