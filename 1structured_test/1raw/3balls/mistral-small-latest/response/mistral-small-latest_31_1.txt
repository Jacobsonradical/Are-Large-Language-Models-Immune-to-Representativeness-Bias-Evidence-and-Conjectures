{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

To reason through this problem, we can calculate the number of combinations for each case using the multinomial coefficient. This coefficient is used to find the number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable objects into k distinct groups with given counts.

For case 1:
A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
Total combinations = C(6,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2:
A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
Total combinations = C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since there are more combinations for case 2 (600) compared to case 1 (270), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
