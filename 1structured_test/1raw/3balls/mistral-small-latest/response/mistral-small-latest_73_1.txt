{case: 2}

Explanation:

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method. There are 8 "stars" (balls) and 2 "bars" (separators) to place among 9 positions. The total number of distributions is C(9,2) = 36.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. This distribution can be achieved in C(2,0) * C(4,0) * C(2,2) = 1 way.
Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This distribution can be achieved in C(2,0) * C(4,1) * C(2,1) = 12 ways.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
