{case: 2}

Reasoning:

Let's compute the probabilities for each case.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can happen in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) ways, which equals 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can happen in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) ways, which equals 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

Since 60 < 90, in a single round, case 1 is more likely to occur. However, the question asks about many rounds of the game.

Over many rounds, the distribution with more possible outcomes (case 2) will appear more often, due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
