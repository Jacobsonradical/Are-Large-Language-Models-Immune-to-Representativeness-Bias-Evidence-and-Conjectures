The distribution of balls in a round of this game follows a multinomial distribution. Each ball has 3 possible destinations (A, B, or C), so there are 3^6 = 729 possible distributions.

Let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2. This is a distribution with 2 balls in each child's set. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into 3 groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1. This is a distribution with 2, 3, and 1 balls for A, B, and C, respectively. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into these groups is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
