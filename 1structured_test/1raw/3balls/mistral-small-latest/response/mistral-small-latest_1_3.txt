{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.}

There are a total of 20 different ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children if we consider the balls to be distinguishable. We can use the stars and bars method to calculate this.

For case 1, there is only 1 way for each child to have 2 balls: A:2, B:2, C:2.

For case 2, there are multiple ways for the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. To find the number of ways, we need to choose which 3 balls go to B and which 1 goes to C. This can be done using combinations: C(6, 3) * C(3, 1) = 20 * 3 = 60.

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
