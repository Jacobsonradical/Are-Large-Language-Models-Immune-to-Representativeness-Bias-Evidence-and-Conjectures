{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In case 1, all three children have an equal number of balls. This means that the number of ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets exactly 2 balls is the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for each child. This can be calculated as: C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

In case 2, two children have different numbers of balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls such that child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball can be calculated as: C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since 60 < 90, there are fewer ways to produce case 2 than case 1 in a single round. However, when considering multiple rounds, we should look at the relative probabilities of each case occurring. The probability of case 1 is 90/C(6, 6) = 90/720, and the probability of case 2 is 60/720 = 1/12.

Although case 1 has more possibilities, case 2 has a higher probability because it includes more unequal distributions of balls (e.g., A:1, B:3, C:2 or A:3, B:2, C:1), which are not counted in case 1. As the number of rounds increases, the distribution will tend to approach the higher probability case, which is case 2.
