{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

To prove this, we can compute the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case and compare the results.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Using the multinomial coefficient formula, there are C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Using the multinomial coefficient formula, there are C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 1,800 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Since 1,800 > 900, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
