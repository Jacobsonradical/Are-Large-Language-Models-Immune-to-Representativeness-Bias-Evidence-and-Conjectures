The distribution of balls in each case represents a specific multinomial distribution. Let's calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into three groups of 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls into one group of 1, one group of 2, and one group of 3 is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 1, 2, 3) = 6! / (1! * 2! * 3!) = 600

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (900) than in case 2 (600), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
