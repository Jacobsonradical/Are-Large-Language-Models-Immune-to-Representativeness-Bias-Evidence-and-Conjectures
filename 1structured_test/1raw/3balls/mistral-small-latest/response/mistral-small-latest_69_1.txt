The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using combinations.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, then C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for B, and 1 way to choose the remaining 2 balls for C. So, there are C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways for case 1.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, then C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and 1 way to choose the remaining 1 ball for C. So, there are C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways for case 2.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

So, the answer is: {case: 1}
