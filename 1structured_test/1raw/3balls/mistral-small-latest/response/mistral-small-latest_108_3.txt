{case: 2,
Explanation:
In this distribution problem, we are dealing with distinguishable balls, meaning each ball is unique. Therefore, the distribution A:2, B:2, C:2 represents only one specific arrangement of balls, while the distribution A:2, B:3, C:1 represents more arrangements.

To calculate this, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the number of combinations C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

Total combinations = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28

For case 1, the combination is C(2,2) * C(2,2) * C(2,2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1

For case 2, the combination is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
