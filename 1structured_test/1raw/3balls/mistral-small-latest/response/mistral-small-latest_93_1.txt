{case: 2}

There are more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 represents a specific distribution where each child gets exactly 2 balls, while case 2 represents any distribution where A has 2 balls, which is more flexible and includes more possible distributions.

To compute the number of possible distributions for each case, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; k1, k2, ..., kn) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kn!)

Case 1:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2:
To find the number of distributions with A:2, we can consider the remaining 4 balls and their distributions among B and C. The possible distributions are (B:3, C:1) and (B:1, C:3).

C(4; 3, 1) = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4
C(4; 1, 3) = 4! / (1! * 3!) = 4

So, there are 4 + 4 = 8 possible distributions for case 2. Since 8 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
