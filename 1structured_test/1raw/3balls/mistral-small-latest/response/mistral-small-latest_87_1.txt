{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly (case 2) than evenly (case 1). The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2, B has 2, and C has 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 900. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1 is given by C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 1500. Since 1500 > 900, there will be more results of case 2.}
