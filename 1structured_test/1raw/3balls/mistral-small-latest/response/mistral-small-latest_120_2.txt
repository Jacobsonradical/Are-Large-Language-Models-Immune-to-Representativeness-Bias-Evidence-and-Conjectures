{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6! (720) ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) ways to choose which 2 balls go to each child, and there are 3! ways to arrange the balls within each child's collection. So, the total number of ways for case 1 is (6C2) * (4C2) * 3! = 900.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) ways to choose which balls go to each child, and there are 2! ways to arrange the balls within A's collection, 3! ways to arrange the balls within B's collection, and 1! way to arrange the ball within C's collection. So, the total number of ways for case 2 is (6C2) * (4C3) * 2! * 3! = 1,800.

Since 1,800 > 900, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
