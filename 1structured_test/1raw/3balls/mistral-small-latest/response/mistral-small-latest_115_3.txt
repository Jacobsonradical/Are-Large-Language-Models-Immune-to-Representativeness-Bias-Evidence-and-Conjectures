{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more possible arrangements than case 1. Case 1 has 15 possible arrangements (calculated using the multinomial coefficient), while case 2 has 90 possible arrangements. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 is more likely to occur.}
