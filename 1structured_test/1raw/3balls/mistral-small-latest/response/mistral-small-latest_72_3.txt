{case: 2}

Explanation: The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions.

The formula is C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups. In this case, n=6 and r=3.

So, the total number of possible distributions is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 1 (since there is only one way to do this).

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(5,1) = 5 (since we are choosing which child will get the extra ball).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 because 5 > 1.
