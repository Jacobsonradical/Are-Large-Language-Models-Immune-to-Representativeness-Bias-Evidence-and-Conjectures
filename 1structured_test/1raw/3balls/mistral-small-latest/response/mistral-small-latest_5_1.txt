{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. The reason is that there are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly than evenly. In case 1, each child gets 2 balls, which can be done in 1 way (since order does not matter in this case). In case 2, there are more possibilities due to the different distributions of balls among the children. Specifically, there are C(6,2)*C(4,3) = 15*4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1. Therefore, there will be more results of case 2.}
