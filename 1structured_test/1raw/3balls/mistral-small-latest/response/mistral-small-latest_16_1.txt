{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that case 2 allows for more combinations of distributing the balls compared to case 1.

Case 1 has 2 balls for each child, meaning all balls are distributed equally. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270.

Case 2 has 2 balls for child A, 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball for child C. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
