{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, there are C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways to do this (since we can treat the balls as indistinguishable in this case).

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1, there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways to do this.

Since 60 > 90/3 (as there are 3 possible orderings of (A:2, B:3, C:1)), case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
