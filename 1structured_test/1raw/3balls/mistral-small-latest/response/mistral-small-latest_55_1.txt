{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children. We want to compare the probability of having case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

To do this, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which counts the number of ways to distribute n distinct objects into k groups with given sizes:

C(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 than in case 1, the probability of observing case 2 is higher. Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
