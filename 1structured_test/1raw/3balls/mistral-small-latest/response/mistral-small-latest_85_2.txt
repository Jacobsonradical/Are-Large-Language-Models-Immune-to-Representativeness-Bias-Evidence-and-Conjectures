{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. The number of ways to distribute the balls among the children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is given by:
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is given by:
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Comparing the two, there are more ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 (600) than in case 1 (900). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
