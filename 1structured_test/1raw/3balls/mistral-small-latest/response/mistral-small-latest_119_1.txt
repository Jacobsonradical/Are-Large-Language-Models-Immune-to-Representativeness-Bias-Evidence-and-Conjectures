{case: 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. We want to find out which case will occur more frequently: case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

To solve this, we need to count the number of ways each distribution can occur. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

For case 1, we have n1 = n2 = n3 = 2, so:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, we have n1 = 2, n2 = 3, and n3 = 1, so:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (180) than for case 1 (90), we can expect that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
