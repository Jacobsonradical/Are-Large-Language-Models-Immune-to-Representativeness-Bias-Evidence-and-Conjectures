The number of combinations for each case can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula.

For case 1, where A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls, the number of combinations is:
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900

For case 2, where A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball, the number of combinations is:
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
