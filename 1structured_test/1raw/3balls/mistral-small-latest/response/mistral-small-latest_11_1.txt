{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the "stars and bars" method, which results in 28 combinations (choose 2 from 8, where 8 represents 6 balls plus 2 separators).

2. In case 1, each child receives 2 balls. This can happen in one specific combination out of the 28 possible combinations.

3. In case 2, there are more possible combinations, as A can have 2 balls in 3 ways (choose 2 out of 6), B can have 3 balls in 4 ways (choose 3 out of 4 remaining balls), and C will automatically get the remaining 1 ball. So, there are a total of 3 * 4 = 12 combinations for case 2.

4. Since 12 > 1, it means that there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
