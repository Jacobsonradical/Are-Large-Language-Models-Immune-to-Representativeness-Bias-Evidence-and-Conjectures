The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, there are 3 choices for 2 balls out of 6, so the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2, there are 3 choices for 2 balls out of 6, and 3 choices for 1 ball out of the remaining 4, so the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,1) * C(3,3) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since 90 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Final answer: {case: 1}
