The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the formula for the number of weak compositions of an integer n into k parts, which is C(n+k-1, k-1), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28, but not all of these result in A:2, B:3, C:1. We need to count the number of ways to give 2 balls to A, 3 to B, and 1 to C, which is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

However, since there are two children (B and C) who can receive 3 and 1 balls respectively, we need to divide this count by 2 to avoid double-counting. So, the number of ways for case 2 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2. So, {case: 2}.
