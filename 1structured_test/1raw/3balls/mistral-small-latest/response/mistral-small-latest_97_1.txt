{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

Let's compute the number of ways each case can occur using combinations.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
Number of ways = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
Number of ways = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (60) than case 1 (90), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
