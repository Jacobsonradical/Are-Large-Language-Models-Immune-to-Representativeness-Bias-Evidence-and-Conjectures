{case: 2}

Explanation:

In case 1, all three children receive an equal number of balls (2 each). This distribution can be achieved in 15 ways. We can calculate this by using the multinomial coefficient formula: C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

In case 2, two children receive different numbers of balls (A:2, B:3, and C:1). This distribution can be achieved in 60 ways. We can calculate this by using the multinomial coefficient formula: C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
