{case: 2, The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each has 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2!2!2!) = 15. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1 is given by C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2!3!1!) = 60. Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
