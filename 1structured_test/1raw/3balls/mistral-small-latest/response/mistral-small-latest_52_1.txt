{case: 2}

Reasoning:
Case 1 represents an even distribution of balls among the three children, with each child receiving 2 balls. This is a less likely outcome because it requires the balls to be divided perfectly.

Case 2 represents an uneven distribution of balls. Since there are many ways to distribute 6 balls unevenly between the three children, this case will occur more frequently.

To compute the exact probabilities, we can use combinations.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children is C(6+3-1, 6) = C(8, 6) = 28.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is C(2, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(2, 1) = 1 * 4 * 2 = 8.

Therefore, case 2 will occur more often than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
