{case: 2}

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 84 possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

For case 1, there are C(2+2-1, 2-1) * C(2+2-1, 2-1) * C(2+2-1, 2-1) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to distribute 2 balls to each child.

For case 2, there are C(2+3-1, 2-1) * C(2+1-1, 1-1) = 6 * 2 = 12 ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C.

Since 12 > 27, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
