{case: 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children, so we need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 (60 ways) than in Case 1 (90 ways), there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
