{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more favorable distributions than case 1. In case 2, there are 3 choices for the child with 3 balls, 3 choices for the child with 2 balls, and 2 choices for the child with 1 ball, leading to a total of 18 possible distributions. In case 1, each child has 2 balls, so there is only 1 way to distribute the balls. Therefore, there will be more outcomes of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
