{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 120 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1, there are C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 90 ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

For case 2, there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 150 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Since 150 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
