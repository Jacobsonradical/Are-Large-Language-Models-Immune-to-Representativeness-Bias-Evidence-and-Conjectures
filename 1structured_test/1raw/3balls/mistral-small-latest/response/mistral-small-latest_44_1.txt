{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of possible distributions is the number of ways to choose which balls go to which child, which can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

The multinomial coefficient formula is:

C(n; n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ) = n! / (n₁! * n₂! * ... * nₖ!)

where n is the total number of items, and n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ are the numbers of items in each group.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
