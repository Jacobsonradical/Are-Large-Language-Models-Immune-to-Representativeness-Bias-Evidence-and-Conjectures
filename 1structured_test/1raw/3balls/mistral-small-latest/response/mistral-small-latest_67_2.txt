The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars and bars method. We have 6 "stars" representing the balls and 2 "bars" separating the balls among the children. So, we have a total of 8 objects to arrange, and we need to choose 2 places for the bars. This can be done in C(8,2) = 28 ways.

Now, let's count the number of ways to get case 1 and case 2:

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls. This is equivalent to not having any bars, as the balls are already evenly distributed. So, there is only 1 way to achieve case 1.

Case 2: One child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the last one gets 1 ball. This can happen in 3 ways (A:2, B:3, C:1 or A:2, C:3, B:1 or B:2, A:3, C:1).

So, there are more results of case 2 than case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
