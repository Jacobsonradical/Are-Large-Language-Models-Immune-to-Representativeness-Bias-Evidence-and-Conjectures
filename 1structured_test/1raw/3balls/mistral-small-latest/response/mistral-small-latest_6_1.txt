{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which is given by n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!) where n is the total number of items and r1, r2, ..., rk are the numbers of items in each group.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the multinomial coefficient is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the multinomial coefficient is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Comparing the two, there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1 in a single distribution. Therefore, over many rounds of the game, we should expect to see more results of case 2.
