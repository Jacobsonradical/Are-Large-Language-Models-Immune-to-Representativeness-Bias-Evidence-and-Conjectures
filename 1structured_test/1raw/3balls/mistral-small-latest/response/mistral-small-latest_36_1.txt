{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 requires an exact even distribution of balls, which has fewer possible combinations than case 2, where the distribution is not as even. The probability of each case can be calculated using the multinomial distribution: P(case 1) = C(6,2,2,2)/3^6 = 150/729, P(case 2) = C(6,2,3,1)/3^6 = 600/729. Since 600 > 150, there will be more results of case 2.}
