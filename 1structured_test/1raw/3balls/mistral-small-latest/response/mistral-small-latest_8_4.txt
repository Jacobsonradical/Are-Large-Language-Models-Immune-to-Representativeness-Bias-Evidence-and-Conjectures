The distribution of balls in each case is a multinomial distribution problem. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using combinations.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated as C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be calculated as C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

So, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
