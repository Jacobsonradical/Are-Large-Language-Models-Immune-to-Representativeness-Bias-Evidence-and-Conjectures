{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Since 360 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
