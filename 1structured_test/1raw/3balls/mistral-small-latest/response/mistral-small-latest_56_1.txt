The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars and bars method. This gives us a total of C(8,2) = 28 ways.

In case 1, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is 1 (since each child gets exactly 2 balls, there's only one way to do this).

In case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(5,2) = 10 (since child A gets 2 balls, and the remaining 4 balls can be distributed between B and C in 10 different ways).

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is {case: 2}.
