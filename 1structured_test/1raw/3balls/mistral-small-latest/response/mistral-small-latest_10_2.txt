{case: 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of 6! (720) ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1, there are (6!/(2!)^3) = 15 ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

For case 2, there are (6!/(2!1!)) = 360 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Since 360 > 15, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
