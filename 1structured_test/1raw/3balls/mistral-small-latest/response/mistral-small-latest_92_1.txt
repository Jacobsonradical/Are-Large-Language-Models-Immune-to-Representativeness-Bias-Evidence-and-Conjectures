{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

This is because in case 1, all three children receive an equal number of balls (2 each), which is a less probable event since there are many ways to distribute the 6 balls unequally among the three children.

On the other hand, in case 2, there is a slight imbalance in the distribution, but it still allows for many possible combinations. In fact, there are more ways to distribute the balls such that one child gets 1 ball, another child gets 2 balls, and the third child gets 3 balls, compared to all children getting 2 balls each.

To compute this, we can use combinations. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 1, the number of ways is C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
For case 2, the number of ways is C(2, 1) * C(3, 2) * C(1, 1) = 2 * 3 * 1 = 6.

Since 6 > 1, there will be more results of case 2.
