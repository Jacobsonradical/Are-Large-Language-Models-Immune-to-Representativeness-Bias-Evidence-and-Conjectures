{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. The total number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, A, B, C) = 6! / (A! * B! * C!)

For case 1, A:2, B:2, C:2, so the number of ways is:
C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 720 / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 1260

For case 2, A:2, B:3, C:1, so the number of ways is:
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 720 / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 630

Since 1260 > 630, there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1. However, case 2 includes more distributions than just the specific distribution A:2, B:3, C:1. It also includes all other distributions where one child has 1 ball, another has 2 balls, and the third has 3 balls.

There are 3 ways to choose which child gets 1 ball (A, B, or C), and for each of these choices, there are 2 ways to choose which child gets 2 balls (since the remaining child must get 3 balls). So, there are a total of 3 * 2 = 6 different distributions included in case 2.

Therefore, the total number of ways to have a distribution included in case 2 is:
6 * 630 = 3780

Since 3780 > 1260, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
