{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.
Reasoning: There are a total of 6 choices for the first ball, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, 3 for the fourth, 2 for the fifth, and 1 for the sixth. In case 1, all children get exactly 2 balls, which means the balls must be distributed in a specific order (e.g., AABBCB). This particular order has a probability of 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90. In case 2, there are more possible orders to achieve the distribution (e.g., AABBBC, AABBC, AAABBC), making it more likely to occur. The probability of one such distribution in case 2 is 6!/(2!3!1!) = 360. Since there are more favorable outcomes in case 2, it will occur more frequently over many rounds of the game.}
