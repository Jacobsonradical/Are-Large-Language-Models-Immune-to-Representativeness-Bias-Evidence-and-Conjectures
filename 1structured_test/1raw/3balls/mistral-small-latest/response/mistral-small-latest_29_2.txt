{case: 2}

To reason through this, let's calculate the probability of each case occurring in one round of the game.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among A, B, and C such that each has 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (60) than for case 1 (15), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
