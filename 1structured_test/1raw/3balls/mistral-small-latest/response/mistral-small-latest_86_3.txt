{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 allows for more combinations of distributing the balls among the three children.

In case 1, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
