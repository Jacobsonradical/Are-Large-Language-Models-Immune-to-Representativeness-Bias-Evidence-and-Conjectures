{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 represents a specific distribution where each child gets exactly 2 balls. There are only 3 ways this can happen: (1,1,4), (1,4,1), and (4,1,1). On the other hand, case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1, is just one of the many distributions where the balls are unevenly distributed. There are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly than evenly, so case 2 will occur more frequently.
