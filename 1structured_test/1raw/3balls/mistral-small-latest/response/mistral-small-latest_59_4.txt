{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.

The reasoning behind this is based on the number of possible combinations for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of combinations can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into 3 groups of 2 each:
Combinations for case 1 = C(6,2,2) = 6! / (2!2!2!) = 90

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of combinations is calculated similarly:
Combinations for case 2 = C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2!3!1!) = 150

Since 150 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
