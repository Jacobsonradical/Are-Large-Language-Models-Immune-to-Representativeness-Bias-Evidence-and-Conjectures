{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated using multinomial coefficients: C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case can be calculated using multinomial coefficients: C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
