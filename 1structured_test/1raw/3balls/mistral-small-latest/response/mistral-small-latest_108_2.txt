{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In case 1, each child gets exactly 2 balls. This would require that, out of 6 balls, 2 are given to each child, which is a specific distribution.

In case 2, there is more flexibility in the distribution of balls. One child can have 1 ball, another can have 3, and the last one has 2. This can happen in multiple ways: A:1, B:2, C:3 or A:1, B:3, C:2 or A:2, B:1, C:3 or A:3, B:1, C:2.

Since case 2 has more possible combinations than case 1, it is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
