{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. The number of possible outcomes for case 1 is the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for each child, which is (6 choose 2)^3 = 900. The number of possible outcomes for case 2 is (6 choose 2)(6 choose 3)(6 choose 1) = 15,120. Since 15,120 > 900, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
