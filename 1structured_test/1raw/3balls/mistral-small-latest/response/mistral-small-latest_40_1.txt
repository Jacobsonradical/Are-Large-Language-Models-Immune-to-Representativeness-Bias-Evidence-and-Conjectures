{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In case 1, all children have an equal number of balls (2 each). This specific distribution has fewer possible combinations than case 2. To calculate the number of combinations for case 1, we use the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90 combinations

In case 2, the distribution is not equal among the children. The number of combinations for case 2 is:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360 combinations

Since 360 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
