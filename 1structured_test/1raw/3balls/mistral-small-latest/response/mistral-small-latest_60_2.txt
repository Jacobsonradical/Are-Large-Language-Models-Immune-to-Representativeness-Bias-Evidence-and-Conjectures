The number of ways to distribute the balls in each case can be calculated using combinations.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2, the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) than in case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is: {case: 1}
