{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation: In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. We are asked to compare the number of occurrences of two specific distributions: case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

To analyze this, let's calculate the number of ways each distribution can occur using combinations.

For case 1:
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
                      = 15 * 6 * 1
                      = 90

For case 2:
Number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1)
                      = 15 * 4 * 1
                      = 60

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (60 ways) than for case 1 (90 ways), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
