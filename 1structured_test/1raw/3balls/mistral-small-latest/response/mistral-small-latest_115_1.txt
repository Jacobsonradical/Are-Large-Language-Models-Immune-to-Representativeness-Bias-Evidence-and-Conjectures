{case: 2,
Reasoning:
There are a total of 6 ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children without any restrictions (using stars and bars method).

For case 1, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls equally among the children.

For case 2, there are 3 ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1. These can be calculated by choosing which child gets 1 ball and giving the rest to the other two.

Since 3 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
