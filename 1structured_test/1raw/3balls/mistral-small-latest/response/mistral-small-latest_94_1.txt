{case: 2}

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. The total number of ways to distribute these balls is given by the "stars and bars" formula, which is C(8,2) = 28.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient (2! * 2! * 2!) / 3! = 1.

In case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is the multinomial coefficient (2! * 3! * 1!) / 3! = 6.

Since 6 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
