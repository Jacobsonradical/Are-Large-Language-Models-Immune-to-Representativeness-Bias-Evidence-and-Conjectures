{case: 2, the number of results of case 2 will be more than that of case 1}

Reasoning:
In each round, there are a total of 6! (720) possible distinct distributions of the 6 balls among the three children.

For case 1, there are C(6,2) x C(4,2) = 15 x 6 = 90 ways to distribute the balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

For case 2, there are C(6,2) x C(4,3) = 15 x 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

However, we can also have A gets 2 balls, B gets 1 ball, and C gets 3 balls, which is another 60 ways to distribute the balls.

So, there are a total of 120 ways to have case 2 distributions in each round.

Since 120 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
