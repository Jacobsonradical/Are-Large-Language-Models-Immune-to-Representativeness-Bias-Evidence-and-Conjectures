{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Reasoning:

We can calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for each case using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
