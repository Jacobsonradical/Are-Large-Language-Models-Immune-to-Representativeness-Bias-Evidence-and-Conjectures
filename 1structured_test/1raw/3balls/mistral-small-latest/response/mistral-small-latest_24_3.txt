{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because case 1 represents a situation where all children have an equal number of balls, which has fewer possible combinations (20 when considering the order in which the balls are distributed to each child) compared to case 2, which has more possible combinations (60 when considering the order). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see case 2 more often.}
