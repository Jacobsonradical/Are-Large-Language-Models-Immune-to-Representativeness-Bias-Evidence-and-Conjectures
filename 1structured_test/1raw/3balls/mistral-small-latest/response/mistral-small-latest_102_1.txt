{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 represents a distribution where each child gets exactly 2 balls, which is less probable than case 2 where the distribution is not so balanced. There are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly (like in case 2) than distributing them evenly (like in case 1).}
