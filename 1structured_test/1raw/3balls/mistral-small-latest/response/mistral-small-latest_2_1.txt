{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. The number of ways to distribute these balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of balls (6), and r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of balls each child receives (in this case, 2, 2, and 2 for case 1, and 2, 3, and 1 for case 2).

For case 1:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
