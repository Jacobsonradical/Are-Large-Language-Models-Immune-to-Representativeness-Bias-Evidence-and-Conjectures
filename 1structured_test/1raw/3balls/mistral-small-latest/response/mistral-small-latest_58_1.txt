The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among A, B, and C can be calculated using the stars and bars method or combinations. There are C(8,2) = 28 ways.

In case 1, A, B, and C each have 2 balls. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A (C(6,2)), then multiply by the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls for B (C(4,2)). This gives us C(6,2)*C(4,2) = 15*6 = 90 ways.

In case 2, A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A (C(6,2)), then multiply by the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 balls for B (C(4,3)). This gives us C(6,2)*C(4,3) = 15*4 = 60 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 1 to occur (90 ways) than for case 2 (60 ways), the answer is:
{case: 1}
