{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method. We have 6 balls (represented as stars) and 2 dividers to separate the balls between the children. So, there are 8 positions in total (6 stars and 2 dividers). The number of ways to distribute the balls is the number of ways to choose 2 positions for the dividers out of 8, which is C(8,2) = 28.

Now, let's count the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is an even distribution of balls. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, and the remaining balls are automatically distributed to children B and C. So, there are C(6,2) = 15 ways for this case.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and 1 ball left for child C. So, there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways for this case.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (60) than in case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
