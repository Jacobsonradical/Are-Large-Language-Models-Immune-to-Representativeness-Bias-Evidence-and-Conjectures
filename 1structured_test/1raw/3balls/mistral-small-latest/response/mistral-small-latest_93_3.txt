{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. We want to compare the number of ways two cases can occur.

For case 1, A:2, B:2, C:2, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, which results in C(4,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B. Since child C will have the remaining 2 balls, there is only 1 way to distribute them. So, the total number of combinations for case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 2, A:2, B:3, C:1, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, which results in C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B. Since child C will have the remaining 1 ball, there is only 1 way to distribute it. So, the total number of combinations for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since 90 < 60, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
