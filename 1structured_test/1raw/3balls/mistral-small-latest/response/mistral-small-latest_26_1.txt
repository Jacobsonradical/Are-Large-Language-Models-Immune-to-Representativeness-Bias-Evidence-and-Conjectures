{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

This is because case 1 represents a specific distribution where each child gets exactly 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls such that each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,2,2) = 6!/(2!^3) = 270.

On the other hand, case 2 represents a less specific distribution where the balls can be distributed in more ways. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,3,1) = 6!/(2!3!1!) = 600.

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.}
