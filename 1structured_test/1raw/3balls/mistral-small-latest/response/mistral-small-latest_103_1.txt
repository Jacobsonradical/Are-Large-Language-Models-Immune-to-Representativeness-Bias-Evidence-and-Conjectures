In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of ways to do this can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is given by C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups. Here, n=6 and r=3, so the total number of ways is C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, the balls are distributed equally, so there is only one way to achieve this distribution.

For case 2, there are several ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1. We can calculate this using the multinomial coefficient, which is given by n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!), where n is the total number of items and n1, n2, n3 are the numbers of items in each group. Here, n=6, n1=2, n2=3, n3=1, so there are 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 630 ways to achieve this distribution.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.

So, the answer is: {case: 2}
