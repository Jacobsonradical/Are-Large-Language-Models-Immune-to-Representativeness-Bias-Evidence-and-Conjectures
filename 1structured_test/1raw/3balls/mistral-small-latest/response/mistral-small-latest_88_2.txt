{case: 2}

Reasoning:
Case 1 represents a perfectly balanced distribution of balls among the three children, with each child receiving exactly 2 balls. This requires that each ball has an equal probability of being given to A, B, or C, which is less likely in a random distribution.

Case 2, on the other hand, allows for some imbalance in the distribution of balls. It's more likely that in a random distribution, some children would end up with more balls than others.

So, in many rounds of the game, we would expect to see more results of Case 2 than Case 1.
