{case: 2, There are more results of case 2 than case 1.

This is because case 1 requires each child to get exactly 2 balls, which is less likely than case 2 where the distribution is not as even. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with 2, 2, and 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

On the other hand, the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with 2, 3, and 1 balls is given by: C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.}
