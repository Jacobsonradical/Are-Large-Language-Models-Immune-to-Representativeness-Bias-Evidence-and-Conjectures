{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because the probability of distributing the balls in a 2-2-2 configuration is lower than distributing them in a 2-3-1 configuration.

To find the probabilities, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of items, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the numbers of items in each group.

For case 1:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more favorable outcomes for case 2 (60) than for case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
