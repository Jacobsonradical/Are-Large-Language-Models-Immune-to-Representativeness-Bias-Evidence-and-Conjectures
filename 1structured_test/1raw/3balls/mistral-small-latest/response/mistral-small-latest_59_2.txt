The problem is a multinomial distribution problem. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is 3^6 = 729.

The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 is the combination of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for each child, which is C(6,2)^3 = (15)^3 = 3375.

The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is the combination of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for child A, choosing 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for child B, and giving the remaining 1 ball to child C, which is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since 3375 > 60, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2 in many rounds of the game.
