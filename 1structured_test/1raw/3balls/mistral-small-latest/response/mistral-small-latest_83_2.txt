{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The distribution in case 1 is an equal distribution of balls among the three children, which is less likely to happen by chance. On the other hand, case 2 represents a more uneven distribution, which has more possibilities.

To compute the probabilities:

1. Total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(8, 6) = 28.

2. In case 1, there is only 1 way to distribute the balls evenly (2 for A, 2 for B, and 2 for C).

3. In case 2, there are C(5, 2) = 10 ways to distribute the balls as A:2, B:3, C:1 (choose 2 balls out of 5 for A, and the remaining balls are distributed to B and C).

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
