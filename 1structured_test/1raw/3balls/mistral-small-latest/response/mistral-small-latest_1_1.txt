{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without considering the order of the balls in each child's possession.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) * C(2, 2) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
