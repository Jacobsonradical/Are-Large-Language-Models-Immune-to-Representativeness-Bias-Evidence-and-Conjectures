{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.}

Explanation:

In case 1, all children have an equal number of balls (2 each). This distribution has a total of 3C2 * 2! = 6 ways to distribute the balls (since we are considering the balls as distinguishable).

In case 2, the balls are distributed unequally among the children. This distribution has a total of 3C2 * 3C1 * 2! = 18 ways to distribute the balls.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, it is more likely to occur than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
