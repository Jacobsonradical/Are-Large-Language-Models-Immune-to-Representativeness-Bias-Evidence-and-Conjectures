The distribution of balls in each case represents a specific multinomial distribution. The probability of each case can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways to distribute the balls is:
C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, it is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
