{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method. We have 6 balls (stars) and need to place 2 dividers between them to separate the balls for each child. This gives us a total of 8 positions to fill, of which 6 are occupied by balls and 2 are occupied by dividers. The number of distributions is thus C(8, 2) = 28.

Now, let's count the number of ways to achieve case 1 and case 2:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Each child has 2 balls. We don't need to place any dividers, as the balls are already separated. So, we have 6 positions for the balls and no positions for dividers. The number of distributions for this case is C(6, 0) = 1.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Child A has 2 balls, Child B has 3 balls, and Child C has 1 ball. We need to place 1 divider between A and B, and no dividers are needed between B and C. So, we have 7 positions to fill (6 balls and 1 divider), and we need to choose 1 position for the divider. The number of distributions for this case is C(7, 1) = 7.

Since 7 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
