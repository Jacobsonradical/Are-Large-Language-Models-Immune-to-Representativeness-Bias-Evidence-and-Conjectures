{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

The reasoning is as follows:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of distinguishable distributions is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(6;2,2,2) for case 1 and C(6;2,3,1) for case 2.

C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15
C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2 (60) than for case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
