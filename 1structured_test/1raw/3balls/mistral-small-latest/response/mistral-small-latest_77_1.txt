{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. In case 1, each child receives 2 balls, which is an equal distribution. This can occur in 15 ways (calculated using multinomial coefficients).

In case 2, one child (B) receives 3 balls, another (A) receives 2 balls, and the third (C) receives 1 ball. This can occur in 60 ways (calculated using multinomial coefficients).

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
