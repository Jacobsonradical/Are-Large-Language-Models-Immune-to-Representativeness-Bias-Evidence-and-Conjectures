{case: 2, there will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

Let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur using combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = C(6,2) × C(4,2) × C(2,2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = C(6,2) × C(4,3) × C(1,1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the number of ways for case 2 is less than for case 1, it might seem counterintuitive that there will be more results of case 2. However, there are more uneven distributions (like case 2) than even distributions (like case 1) when distributing 6 balls among 3 children.

To compare, let's look at another uneven distribution: case 3 --- A:3, B:2, C:1
Number of ways = C(6,3) × C(3,2) × C(1,1) = 20 × 3 × 1 = 60

If we add the number of ways for case 2 and case 3, we get 60 + 60 = 120. Since there are more uneven distributions with the same or fewer ways than case 2, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
