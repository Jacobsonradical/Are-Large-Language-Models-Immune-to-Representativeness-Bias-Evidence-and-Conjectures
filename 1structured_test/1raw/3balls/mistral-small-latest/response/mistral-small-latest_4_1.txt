{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

To reason through this, let's consider the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. This can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method or combinations with repetitions. There are C(8, 2) = 28 different distributions.

Now, let's count the number of ways for each case:

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
Number of ways = C(2+1, 2) * C(2+1, 2) * C(2+1, 2) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Number of ways = C(2+1, 2) * C(3+1, 2) * C(1+1, 1) = 3 * 6 * 2 = 36

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (36) than in case 1 (27), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
