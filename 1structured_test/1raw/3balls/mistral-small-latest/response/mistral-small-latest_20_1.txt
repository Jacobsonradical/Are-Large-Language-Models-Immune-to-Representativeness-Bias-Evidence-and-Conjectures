The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the "stars and bars" method, which counts the number of ways to place 5 dividers between 6 balls. The total number of distributions is C(11, 5) = 462.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is the multinomial coefficient (2! * 2! * 2!)/(6!) = 15.
For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is (2! * 3! * 1!)/(6!) = 30.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 than case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
