{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

This is because case 1 requires an equal distribution of balls among the children, which is less likely due to the distinguishable nature of the balls.

On the other hand, case 2 allows for a slightly uneven distribution of balls, which provides more possible combinations.

For instance, in case 2 there are 20 possible combinations (AABBC, ABABC, ABBCA, ABBCA, BBAAC, BBACA, BBCA, BCAB, BCBA, BCCA, CAAAB, CAAB, CABA, CABB, CBAAB, CBAB, CBBAA, CBBA, CBCA, CCAB), while in case 1 there are only 15 possible combinations (AAABBB, AABABB, AABBAB, AABBBA, ABBAAB, ABBABA, ABBBA, BBAABB, BBABAB, BBABBA, BBAAAB, BBAABA, BABABA, BABBAA, BBAAB).

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we would expect more results of case 2.
