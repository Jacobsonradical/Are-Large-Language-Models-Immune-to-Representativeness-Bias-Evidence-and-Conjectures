{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:
In total, there are 20 distinguishable ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children (using the "stars and bars" method).

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. There is only 1 way to achieve this distribution, as each child gets exactly 2 balls.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to achieve this distribution is the combination of choosing 2 balls for A and 1 ball for C out of the 6 balls, which is C(6,2) * C(4,1) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since 60 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
