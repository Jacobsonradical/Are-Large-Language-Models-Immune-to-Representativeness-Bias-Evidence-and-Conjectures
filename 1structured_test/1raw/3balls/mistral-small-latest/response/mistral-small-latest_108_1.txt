{case: 2, This is because case 2 has more possible distributions than case 1. In case 1, each child gets exactly 2 balls. This can happen in 15 ways (3C2 * 3C2 * 3C2, where 3C2 is the combinations of choosing 2 items from a set of 3). In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1. This can happen in 60 ways (3C2 * 3C3 * 3C1). Therefore, case 2 will occur more frequently.}
