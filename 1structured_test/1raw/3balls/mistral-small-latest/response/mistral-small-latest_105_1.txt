{case: 2, The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is greater than in case 1. This can be calculated using combinations. Case 1 has C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 possible distributions. Case 2 has C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 possible distributions. So, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
