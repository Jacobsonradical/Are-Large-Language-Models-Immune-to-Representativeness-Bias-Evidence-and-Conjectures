The answer is {case: 2}.

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 28 possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children without considering the order of the balls (i.e., using combinations).

For case 1, all children receive 2 balls each. This is equivalent to choosing 2 balls out of 6 for each child, which can be done in C(6, 2)^3 ways. So, there are 20^3 = 8000 possible outcomes for case 1.

For case 2, we have three scenarios: (A:3, B:2, C:1), (A:1, B:3, C:2), and (A:2, B:3, C:1). Calculating the number of outcomes for each scenario and adding them up, we get:

C(6, 3) \* C(3, 2) \* C(3, 1) + C(6, 1) \* C(5, 3) \* C(2, 1) + C(6, 2)^2 \* C(4, 1) = 20 \* 3 \* 3 + 6 \* 10 \* 2 + 15^2 \* 4 = 360 + 120 + 900 = 1380

Since there are more outcomes for case 2 (1380) than for case 1 (8000), we can expect more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
