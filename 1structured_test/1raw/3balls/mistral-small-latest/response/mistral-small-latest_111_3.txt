The probability of each case occurring can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient, which is a generalization of the binomial coefficient.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient (6, 2, 2, 0) + (6, 2, 1, 3) + (6, 1, 2, 3) + (6, 0, 2, 4) = 924.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient (6, 2, 2, 2) = 270.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient (6, 2, 3, 1) = 630.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2.
