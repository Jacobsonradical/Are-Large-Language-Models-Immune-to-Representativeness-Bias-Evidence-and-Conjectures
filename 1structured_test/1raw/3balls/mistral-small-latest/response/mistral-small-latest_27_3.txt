{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In case 1, all three children get an equal number of balls (2 each). This is a specific arrangement out of many possible arrangements. To find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets 2, we can use combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

In case 2, the balls are distributed unevenly among the children. There are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly because there are more possible uneven distributions than even ones. To find the number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2, we can use combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

However, there are also other uneven distributions, such as A:3, B:2, C:1, which have even more possibilities (C(6,3) * C(3,2) * C(1,1) = 20 * 3 * 1 = 60 ways). When we add up all the possible uneven distributions, we find that there are more uneven distributions than the one specific even distribution.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
