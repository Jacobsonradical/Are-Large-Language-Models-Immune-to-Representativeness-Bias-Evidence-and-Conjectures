{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 possible distributions of the 6 balls among the 3 children when order does not matter within each child's group.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls. There are C(6,2) x C(4,2) = 15 x 6 = 90 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. There are C(6,2) x C(4,3) = 15 x 4 = 60 ways to distribute the balls in this case.

Since 60 < 90, there will be more results of case 1 in a single round. However, if we consider multiple rounds of the game, the more likely outcome is case 2 because there are more possible distributions that result in an uneven split of balls among the children. In other words, it's more likely for one child to end up with a different number of balls than the others due to the higher number of combinations leading to an uneven split.
