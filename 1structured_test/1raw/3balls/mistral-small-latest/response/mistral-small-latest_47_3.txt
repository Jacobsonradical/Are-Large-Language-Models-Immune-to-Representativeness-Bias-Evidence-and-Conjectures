{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In case 1, each child gets exactly 2 balls. This can happen in 15 different ways (using the multinomial coefficient formula: C(n; r_1, r_2, r_3) = n! / (r_1! * r_2! * r_3!), where n = 6, r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 2).

In case 2, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3, and the last one gets 1. This can happen in 60 different ways (using the same formula with n = 6, r_1 = 2, r_2 = 3, r_3 = 1).

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
