{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of ways to do this can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method, which is equivalent to combinations with repetitions. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(8, 2) = 28.

Now let's count the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This is an even distribution of balls among the children. There are 3! (6) ways to arrange the children with this distribution.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
There are 3 ways to choose which child gets 1 ball, and then 2 ways to distribute the remaining 5 balls between the other two children. So, there are 3 * C(4, 1) = 12 ways for this case.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (12) than in case 1 (6), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
