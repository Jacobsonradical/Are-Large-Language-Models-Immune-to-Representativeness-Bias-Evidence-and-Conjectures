{case: 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of ways is C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 900.
For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 1,260.

Since 1,260 > 900, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
