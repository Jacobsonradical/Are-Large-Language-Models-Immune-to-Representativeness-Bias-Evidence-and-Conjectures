{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

This is a problem of counting combinations. The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children is given by the stars-and-bars method, which is equivalent to the number of combinations of 8 items (6 balls and 2 dividers) taken 2 at a time, C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, all children have 2 balls each. There are only 3 ways to arrange this, as the dividers can be placed in 3 positions between the 6 balls.

For case 2, child A has 2 balls, child B has 3 balls, and child C has 1 ball. There are 6 ways to arrange this, as there are 6 possible positions for the ball that child C has.

Since 6 > 3, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
