The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

So, there will be more results of case 2.
