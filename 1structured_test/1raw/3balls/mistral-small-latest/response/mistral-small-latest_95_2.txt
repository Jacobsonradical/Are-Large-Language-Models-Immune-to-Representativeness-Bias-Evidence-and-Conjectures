{case: 2, Since the distribution in case 2 has more possible combinations than in case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}

Explanation:

In case 1, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

In case 2, the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball is given by:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
