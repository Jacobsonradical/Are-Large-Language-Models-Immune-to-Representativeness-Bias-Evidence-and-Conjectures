The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children can be calculated using the stars and bars method, which is a combinatorial technique used to solve problems of this type.

The total number of ways to distribute the balls is C(8,2) = 28, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

In case 1, all children have 2 balls each. This can be thought of as placing 2 dividers among 6 balls, so each child gets 2 balls. This can be done in C(6,2) = 15 ways.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be thought of as placing 2 dividers among 6 balls in such a way that the first two balls go to A, the next three go to B, and the rest go to C. This can be done in C(4,1) = 4 ways.

So, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
