{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

To reason through this, let's consider the number of ways each distribution can occur. In case 1, all three children receive an equal number of balls (2 each). This can occur in (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

In case 2, two children receive different numbers of balls (2 and 3). The number of ways this can occur is (6 choose 2) * (4 choose 3) * (1 choose 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways.

However, we also need to consider the symmetric cases where the distribution is (A:3, B:2, C:1) or (A:2, C:3, B:1). There are two such cases, and each can occur in 60 ways (as calculated above). So, there are a total of 60 * 2 = 120 ways for case 2-like distributions.

Since 120 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
