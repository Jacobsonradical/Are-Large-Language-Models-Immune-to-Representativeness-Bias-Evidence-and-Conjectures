{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. The number of ways to do this is:
C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to do this is:
C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
