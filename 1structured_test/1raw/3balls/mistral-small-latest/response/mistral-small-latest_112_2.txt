{case: 2, This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly than evenly. For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children with each getting 2 is 15, calculated using the multinomial coefficient n! / (r1! * r2! * r3!) where n = 6 and r1 = r2 = r3 = 2. For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 630, calculated similarly with n = 6 and r1 = 2, r2 = 3, r3 = 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, case 2 is more likely to occur.}
