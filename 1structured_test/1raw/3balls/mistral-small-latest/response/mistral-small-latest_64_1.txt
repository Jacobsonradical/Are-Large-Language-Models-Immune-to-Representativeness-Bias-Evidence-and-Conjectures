{case: 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(8, 2). This gives us a total of 28 possible distributions.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 ways.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60 ways.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
