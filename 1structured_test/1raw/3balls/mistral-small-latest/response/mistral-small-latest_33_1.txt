{case: 2, The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2, B has 2, and C has 2 (case 1) is C(6,2)*C(4,2) = 15*6 = 90. The number of ways to distribute the balls such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1 (case 2) is C(6,2)*C(4,3) = 15*4 = 60. Since 90 < 60*3, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
