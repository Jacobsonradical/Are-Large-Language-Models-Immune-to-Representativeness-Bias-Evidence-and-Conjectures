{case: 2, The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2, B has 2, and C has 2 is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 900. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1 is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 1500. Since 1500 > 900, there will be more results of case 2.}
