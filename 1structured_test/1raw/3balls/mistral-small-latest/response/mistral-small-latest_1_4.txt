It is more likely that there will be results of case 2.

Here's the reasoning:

In case 1, all children receive an equal number of balls, which is a specific arrangement. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children. So, the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is C(8,2) = 28.

In case 2, one child gets more balls than the others, which allows for more possible arrangements. There are 3 ways to choose which child gets 2 balls (since there are 3 children), and then there are C(4,2) = 6 ways to distribute the remaining 4 balls among the other 2 children. So, the total number of ways to have the distribution in case 2 is 3 * 6 = 18.

Since 18 > 28, it is more likely that the distribution will be like case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is: {case: 2}
