{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. In case 1, each child gets 2 balls, which is an even distribution. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900

In case 2, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is given by:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Comparing the two, there are more ways for the balls to be distributed as in case 2. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
