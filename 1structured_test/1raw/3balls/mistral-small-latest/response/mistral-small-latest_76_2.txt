The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children can be calculated using multinomial coefficients.

For case 1, the distribution is 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270.

For case 2, the distribution is 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Since there are more ways to achieve case 2 (600) than case 1 (270), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is: {case: 2}
