{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.}

Explanation:
In each round, there are a total of 6! (720) possible ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2, where the balls are distributed as A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by:
C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
