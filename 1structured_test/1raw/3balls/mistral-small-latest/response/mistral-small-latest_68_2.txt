The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using combinations with repetitions.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, the number of ways is C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2), which equals 28 * 15 * 6 = 2520.

For case 2, where the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways is C(8, 2) * C(6, 3) * C(3, 1), which equals 28 * 20 * 3 = 1680.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
