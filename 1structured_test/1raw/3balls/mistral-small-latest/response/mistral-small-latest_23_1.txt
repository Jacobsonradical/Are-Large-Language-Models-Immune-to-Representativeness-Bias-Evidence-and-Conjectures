{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. In case 1, each child receives 2 balls. This is a balanced distribution and there is only one way to achieve this distribution (i.e., 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C).

In case 2, child A receives 2 balls, child B receives 3 balls, and child C receives 1 ball. This is an unbalanced distribution. There are more ways to achieve this distribution because we can choose which 2 balls go to A from a total of 6 balls in C(6,2) = 15 ways, and the remaining 4 balls will automatically be distributed as 3 to B and 1 to C.

Since there are more ways to achieve the unbalanced distribution in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
