{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars and bars method, where the stars represent the balls and the bars separate the children. We have 6 stars and 2 bars (since there are 3 children), so there are 8 spaces in total. The number of distributions is the number of ways to choose 2 positions for the bars out of 8 possible positions, which is ${8}\choose{2}$ = 28.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be viewed as placing 2 bars between the 6 balls, resulting in 7 spaces (2 balls for each child). So there is only 1 way to achieve case 1.

For case 2, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3, and the last one gets 1. This can be viewed as placing 1 bar between the first 2 balls and another bar between the first 5 balls, resulting in 6 spaces (2, 3, and 1 balls for each child). There are ${6}\choose{2}$ = 15 ways to choose the positions of the bars, so there are 15 ways to achieve case 2.

Since 15 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
