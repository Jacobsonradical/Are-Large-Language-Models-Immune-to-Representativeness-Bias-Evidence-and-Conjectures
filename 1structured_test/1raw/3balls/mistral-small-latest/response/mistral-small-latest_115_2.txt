{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. There are a total of C(n+r-1, r-1) ways to distribute n identical objects into r distinct containers, where C(n, k) is the combinations of n items taken k at a time. However, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to multiply this by r^n.

In our case, n = 6 and r = 3, so the total number of possible distributions is 3^6 = 729.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there are C(8, 2) * 3! = 28 * 6 = 168 possible distributions.
For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(8, 3) * 3! = 56 * 6 = 336 possible distributions.

Since 336 > 168, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
