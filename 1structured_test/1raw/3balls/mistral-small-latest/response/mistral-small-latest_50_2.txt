{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6, 2, 2, 0) + C(6, 2, 1, 3) + C(6, 1, 2, 3) + C(6, 0, 3, 3) = 15

For case 1, the balls are distributed evenly among the children, so there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this case:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 1

For case 2, there are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly among the children:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 15

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
