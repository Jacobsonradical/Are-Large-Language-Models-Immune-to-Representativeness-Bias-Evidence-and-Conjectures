{case: 2, there will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is (n+r-1) choose (r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups. In this case, n=6 and r=3.

Total ways = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28

Now let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, times the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls out of 4 for child B, times 1 (since child C is left with the remaining 2 balls).

Ways for case 1 = C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90

However, since the children are distinguishable, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the children, which is 3! = 6.

So, the number of distinct ways for case 1 = 90 / 6 = 15

Case 2: One child gets 1 ball, one gets 3, and one gets 2. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 1 ball out of 6 for the child with 1 ball, times the number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 5 for the child with 3 balls, times the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls out of 2 for the child with 2 balls, times the number of ways to arrange the children with those distributions.

Ways for case 2 = C(6,1) * C(5,3) * C(2,2) * (3!) / (2!) = 6 * 10 * 1 * 6 / 2 = 180

Since there are more ways for case 2 than for case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
