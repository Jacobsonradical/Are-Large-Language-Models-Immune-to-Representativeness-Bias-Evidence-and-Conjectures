{case: 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of 6! (720) ways to distribute the 6 distinguishable balls among the three children.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is (2!)^3 (8), as each child gets 2 balls.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is 6! / (2!3!1!) (60).

Since 60 > 8, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
