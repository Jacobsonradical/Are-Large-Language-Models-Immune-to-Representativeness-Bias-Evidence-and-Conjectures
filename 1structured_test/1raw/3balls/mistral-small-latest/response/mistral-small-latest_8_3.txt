{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this game, there are 6 distinguishable balls to distribute among 3 children, A, B, and C. The total number of ways to distribute these balls is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is 20 in this case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
This distribution has 15 possible arrangements (3! arrangements for each pair of balls, and 3 pairs of balls).

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
This distribution has 30 possible arrangements (3! arrangements for the 2 balls with A, and 3 choices for the remaining ball with B or C).

Since 30 > 15, there are more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
