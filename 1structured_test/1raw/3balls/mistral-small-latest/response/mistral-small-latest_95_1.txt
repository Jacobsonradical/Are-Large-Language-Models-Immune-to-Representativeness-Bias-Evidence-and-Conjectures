{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is (n+r-1) choose (r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups. In this case, n=6 and r=3:

Total ways = (6+3-1) choose (3-1) = 8 choose 2 = 28

Now, let's calculate the number of ways for each case:

Case 1: Each child has 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
Case 1 ways = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:
Case 2 ways = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 (Case 2) is greater than 90 (Case 1), there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
