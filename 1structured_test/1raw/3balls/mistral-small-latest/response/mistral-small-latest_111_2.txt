{case: 2, Reasoning: There are more ways to distribute the balls so that the outcome is case 2 than case 1. For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 2, 2) = 270. For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient (6 choose 2, 3, 1) = 630. Since 630 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
