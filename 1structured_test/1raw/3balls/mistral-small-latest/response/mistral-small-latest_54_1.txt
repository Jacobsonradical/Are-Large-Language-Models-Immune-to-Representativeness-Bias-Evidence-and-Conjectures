{case: 2,
Reasoning:
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using combinations.
For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child, then multiplying these numbers together. This gives (6C2)^3 = 900.
For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is (6C2)*(4C3) = 90.
Since 900 > 90, there will be more results of case 1 in a single round of the game.
However, case 2 includes more unequal distributions, which are more numerous than the equal distributions of case 1. For example, there are also distributions like A:1, B:3, C:2 or A:3, B:2, C:1. If we consider all these distributions, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
