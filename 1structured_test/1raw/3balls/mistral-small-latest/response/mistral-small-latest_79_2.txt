{case: 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

For case 1, the number of ways is C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, the number of ways is C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls as in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
