{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r) = C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

For case 2, there are two sub-cases: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1 OR A gets 2 balls, B gets 1, and C gets 3. Each sub-case can be achieved in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways. So, there are a total of 2 * 60 = 120 ways for case 2.

Since 120 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
