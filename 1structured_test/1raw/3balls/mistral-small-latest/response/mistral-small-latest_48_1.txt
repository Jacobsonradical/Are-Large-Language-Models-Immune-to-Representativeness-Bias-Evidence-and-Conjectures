{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute the 6 balls such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1, compared to the case where all children have 2 balls each. The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90. The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60. Since 60 > 90, there will be more occurrences of case 2.}
