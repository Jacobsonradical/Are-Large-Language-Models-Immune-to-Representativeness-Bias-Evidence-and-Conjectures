{case: 2, there will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:

There are a total of 6 balls, and we need to distribute them among A, B, and C. We want to compare the number of possible distributions for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) and case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

To find the number of distributions for each case, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which counts the number of ways to distribute n distinguishable objects into k distinct groups with given amounts in each group:

Multinomial coefficient = n! / (a1! * a2! * ... * ak!)

where n is the total number of objects, and a1, a2, ..., ak are the numbers of objects in each group.

Case 1:
Multinomial coefficient = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2:
Multinomial coefficient = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

Since the multinomial coefficient for case 2 is larger than for case 1, there will be more distributions of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
