{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because there are more ways to distribute 6 balls unevenly among 3 children than distributing them evenly. In case 1, the balls are distributed evenly with 2 balls each for A, B, and C. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for each child, and there are 3! ways to arrange the children, so there are a total of C(6,2)^3 * 3! = 900 ways to distribute the balls evenly. In case 2, the balls are distributed unevenly with 2, 3, and 1 balls for A, B, and C, respectively. There are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and 1 way to choose 1 ball for C. There are also 3! ways to arrange the children, so there are a total of C(6,2) * C(4,3) * 3! = 1,800 ways to distribute the balls unevenly in this specific case. Since there are more ways to distribute the balls unevenly, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.}
