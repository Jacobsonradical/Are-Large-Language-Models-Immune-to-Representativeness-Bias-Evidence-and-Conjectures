{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute 6 balls into A:2, B:3, C:1 than A:2, B:2, C:2. Specifically, the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is C(6,2) \* C(4,3) = 15 \* 4 = 60, while the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is C(6,2) \* C(4,2) / 2! = 15 \* 6 / 2 = 45, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, and the division by 2! in case 1 is to account for the fact that the balls given to A and B are indistinguishable.}
