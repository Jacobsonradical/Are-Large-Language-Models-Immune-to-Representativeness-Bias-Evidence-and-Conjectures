{case: 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. To find the number of ways to distribute the balls, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of balls and r1, r2, ..., rk are the numbers of balls given to each child.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more ways to have the distribution in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
