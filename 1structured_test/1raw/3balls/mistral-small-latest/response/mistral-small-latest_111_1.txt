{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.}

Explanation:

In each round, the 6 balls can be distributed among the three children in 203 different ways. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula C(n; k1, k2, ..., kn) = n! / (k1! * k2! * ... * kn!), where n = 6 and k1 = k2 = k3 = 2 in case 1, and k1 = 2, k2 = 3, k3 = 1 in case 2.

The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 1 is C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.
The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
