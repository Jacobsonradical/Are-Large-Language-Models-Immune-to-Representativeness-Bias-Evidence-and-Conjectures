{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8,2) = 28 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can happen in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways.

In case 2, one child gets 1 ball, another 3, and the last 2. This can happen in C(6,1) * C(5,3) * C(2,2) = 6 * 10 * 1 = 60 ways.

Since 60 < 90, there will be more results of case 1 in a single round. However, if we consider multiple rounds, the probability of each case happening remains the same. The total number of ways for case 2 (60) is less than the combined total number of ways for all other distributions where children have different numbers of balls. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
