{case: 2, There are more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because in case 2, one child gets an extra ball compared to the others, while in case 1, all children have an equal number of balls. There are more ways to distribute balls unequally among the children than equally. The number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is 15 (combinations of 6 choose 2 for each child), while the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is 60 (combinations of 6 choose 2 for the child with 2 balls, and combinations of 4 choose 3 for the child with 3 balls).}
