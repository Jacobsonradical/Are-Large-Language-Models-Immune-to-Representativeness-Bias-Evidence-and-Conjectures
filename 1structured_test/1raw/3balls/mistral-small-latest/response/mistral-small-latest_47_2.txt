{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: C(n; n1, n2, n3) = n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!), where n = 6, n1, n2, and n3 are the number of balls given to each child.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 900.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 than in case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
