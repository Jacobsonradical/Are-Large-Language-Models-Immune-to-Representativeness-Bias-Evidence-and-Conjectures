{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 requires all three children to receive an equal number of balls, which is less likely than case 2 where the distribution is not equal.

To prove this, we can calculate the probabilities of each case using combinations. The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination C(8,2) = 28 (since we consider each child's "empty" share as one additional ball).

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute 2, 3, and 1 ball is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.

The probability of case 1 is 90/28, and the probability of case 2 is 60/28. Since 60 > 90, there will be more instances of case 2 than case 1 over many rounds of the game.
