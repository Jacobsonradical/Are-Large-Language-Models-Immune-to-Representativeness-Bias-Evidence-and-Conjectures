{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
Case 1 requires an equal distribution of balls, which is less likely because there are more ways to distribute the balls unequally.

Case 2 allows for some unevenness in the distribution, and there are more combinations that result in this distribution.

To calculate the number of combinations for each case, we can use the stars and bars method, which is a way to count the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinct boxes.

For case 1, we have 6 stars (balls) and 2 bars (separators between children), and we want each section to have 2 stars. The number of combinations is given by the binomial coefficient C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 2, we have 6 stars and again 2 bars, but now we want one section to have 3 stars and another to have 1 star. This can be calculated as the sum of C(7, 1) + C(7, 2) = 7 + 21 = 28 combinations.

Since both cases have the same number of combinations, it might seem like they would occur equally often. However, the question asks for the distribution in many rounds, and during those rounds, there are other possible uneven distributions that are not accounted for in case 1 but are included in case 2 (e.g., A:1, B:3, C:2). As a result, there will be more outcomes similar to case 2 over many rounds of the game.
