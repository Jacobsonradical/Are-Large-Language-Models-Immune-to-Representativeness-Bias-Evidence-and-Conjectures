The problem can be solved using the concept of combinations.

The total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls is the number of combinations of choosing 2 balls out of 6 for A, 2 balls out of the remaining 4 for B, and the rest for C, which is C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90.

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90, because each child gets exactly 2 balls.

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute the balls is C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60, because A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets the remaining 1.

Therefore, there will be more results of case 1, as there are more ways to distribute the balls in this manner.
