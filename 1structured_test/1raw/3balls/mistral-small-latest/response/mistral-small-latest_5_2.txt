{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6! (720) possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. We can use combinations to calculate the number of ways for each case.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
The number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C is given by:
C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
