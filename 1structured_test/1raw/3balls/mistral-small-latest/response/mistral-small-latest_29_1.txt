{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula or the number of partitioning functions.

In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2, which can be achieved in (6!)/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1, which can be achieved in (6!)/(2!3!1!) = 180 ways.

Since 180 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
