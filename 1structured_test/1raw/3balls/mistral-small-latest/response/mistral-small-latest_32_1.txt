{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 1 represents a perfectly even distribution of balls, which is less likely to occur by chance than the uneven distribution in case 2.

To provide a more mathematical explanation, let's calculate the number of ways each case can occur. We can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which for n distinguishable balls and r children is given by:

C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where r1, r2, ..., rk are the numbers of balls each child receives, and k = 3 in this case.

For case 1:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (360) than for case 1 (90), we can expect more instances of case 2 to appear in many rounds of the game.
