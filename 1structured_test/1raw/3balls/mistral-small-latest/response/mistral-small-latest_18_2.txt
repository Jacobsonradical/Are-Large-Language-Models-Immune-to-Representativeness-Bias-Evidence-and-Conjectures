{case: 2, There are more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls so that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 than there are to distribute them evenly. Specifically, there are 15 ways to distribute the balls in case 2 (C(6,2) \* C(4,3)), while there are only 15 ways to distribute them in case 1 (C(6,2) \* C(4,2) \* C(2,2)), where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.}
