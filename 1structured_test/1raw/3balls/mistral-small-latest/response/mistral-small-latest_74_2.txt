{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls such that A has 2, B has 3, and C has 1 than distributing the balls evenly among the three children. The number of ways to distribute the balls for each case can be computed using combinations. For case 1, the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90. For case 2, the number of ways is C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60. However, since there are two possible orders for case 2 (B:3, C:1 and B:1, C:3), the total number of ways for case 2 is 60 * 2 = 120. So, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
