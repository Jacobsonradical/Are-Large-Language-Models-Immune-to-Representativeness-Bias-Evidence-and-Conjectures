{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:
In case 1, all three children receive 2 balls each. This is an exact distribution, and there are only 15 ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children such that each child gets exactly 2 balls.

In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. This is also an exact distribution, but there are more ways to achieve this distribution. Specifically, there are 90 ways to distribute the balls in this manner (choose 2 balls for A from 6, choose 3 from the remaining 4 for B, and the last ball goes to C).

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
