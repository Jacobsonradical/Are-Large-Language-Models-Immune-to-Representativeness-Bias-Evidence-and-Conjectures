{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6 balls and 3 children. The number of ways to distribute these balls among the children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, where each child gets 2 balls, the number of ways is given by:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the number of ways is given by:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
