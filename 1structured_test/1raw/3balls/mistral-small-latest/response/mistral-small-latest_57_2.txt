{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6 balls to distribute among 3 children. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the concept of combinations, which is given by the formula nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated as 6C2 * 6C2 * 6C2 = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.

In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be calculated as 6C2 * 6C3 * 6C1 = 15 * 20 * 6 = 1800.

Since 1800 is greater than 3375, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
