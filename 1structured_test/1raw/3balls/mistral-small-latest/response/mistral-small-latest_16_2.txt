The distribution of balls in this game follows a multinomial distribution. The probability of each case occurring can be calculated using the formula for multinomial coefficients.

For case 1, where A, B, and C each get 2 balls, the probability is C(6,2,2) * (1/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 * (1/3)^2 = 150 * (1/27) = 5.56 (approximately).

For case 2, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, the probability is C(6,2,3,1) * (1/3)^2 * (1/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 720 * (1/27) = 26.67 (approximately).

Since the probability of case 2 is higher than the probability of case 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is {case: 2}.
