{case: 2, The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children such that each child gets 2 balls is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6! / (2! 2! 2!) = 900. The number of ways to distribute the balls such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1 is given by the multinomial coefficient: 6! / (2! 3! 1!) = 600. Since 600 > 900, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.}
