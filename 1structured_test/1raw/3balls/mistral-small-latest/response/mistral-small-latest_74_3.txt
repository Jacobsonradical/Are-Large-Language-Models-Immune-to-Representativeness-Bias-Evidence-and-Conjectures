The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children can be calculated using the stars and bars method, which is a common technique in combinatorics. In this case, we have 6 "stars" (balls) and 2 "bars" (dividers between children). The total number of placements for the 8 objects (6 stars and 2 bars) is C(8,2) = 28.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be thought of as placing the 2 bars in the spaces between the 6 balls, so there are C(6,2) = 15 ways to do this.

For case 2, there are 3 ways to choose which child gets 1 ball (either A, B, or C), and then there are C(5,2) = 10 ways to place the remaining 5 balls among the other 2 children. So, there are 3 * 10 = 30 ways for case 2.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
