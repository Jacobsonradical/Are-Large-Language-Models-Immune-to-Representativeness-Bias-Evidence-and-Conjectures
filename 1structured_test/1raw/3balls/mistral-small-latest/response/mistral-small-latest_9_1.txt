{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more possible combinations than case 1. In case 1, each child gets 2 balls, and there are 3 choices for each ball, so there are C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90 ways to distribute the balls. In case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3, and C gets 1, so there are C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60 ways to distribute the balls. Since 60 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
