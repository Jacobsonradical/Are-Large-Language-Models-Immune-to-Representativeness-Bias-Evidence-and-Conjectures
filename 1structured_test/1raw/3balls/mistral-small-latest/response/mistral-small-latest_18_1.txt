{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of items and r is the number of groups.

In this case, n = 6, and r = 3.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the number of combinations is C(8, 2) * 3! / 2!^3 = 28.

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of combinations is C(8, 1) * C(5, 2) * 3! / 2! = 168.

Since 168 > 28, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
