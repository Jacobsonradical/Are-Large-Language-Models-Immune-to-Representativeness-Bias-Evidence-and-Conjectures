{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more possible distributions compared to case 1. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children with each child getting 2 balls is given by the combination formula C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90. The number of ways to distribute the balls as in case 2 is given by C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60. Since 90 < 60, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
