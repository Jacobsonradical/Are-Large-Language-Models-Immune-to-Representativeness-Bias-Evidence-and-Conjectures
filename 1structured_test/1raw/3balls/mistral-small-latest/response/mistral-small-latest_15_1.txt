{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

To reason through this question, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula: C(n+r-1, r) = C(8, 2) = 28.

In case 1, each child receives 2 balls. This can happen in C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 ways.
In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can happen in C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 30 ways.

Since there are more ways for case 2 to occur (30) than for case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
