{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient:
C(6, 2, 2, 0) for case 1 and C(6, 2, 3, 1) for case 2.

C(6, 2, 2, 0) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 0!) = 90 ways
C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600 ways

Since 600 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
