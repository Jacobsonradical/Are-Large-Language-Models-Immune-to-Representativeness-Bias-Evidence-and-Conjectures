The two cases represent different distributions of the balls among the children. The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 900.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 1800.

So, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
