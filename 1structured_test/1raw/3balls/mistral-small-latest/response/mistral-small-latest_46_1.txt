{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. The total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(n, r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

where n is the total number of balls, r1, r2, ..., rk are the numbers of balls given to each child, and k is the number of children.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(6, 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1, so the number of ways to distribute the balls is:

C(6, 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 2, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
