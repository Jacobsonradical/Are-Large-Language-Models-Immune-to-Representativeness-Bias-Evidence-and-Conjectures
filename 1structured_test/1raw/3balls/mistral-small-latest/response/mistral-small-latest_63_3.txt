{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

This is because case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) has more possible distributions than case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).

In case 1, there are only 3 ways to distribute the balls (AABBCC, BBAACC, CCAABB), considering that the balls are distinguishable.

In case 2, there are 15 possible distributions (AABBC, ABBCA, ABBCA, BBAAC, BBACA, BAABC, BABAC, ABCBA, ACBBA, CABBA).

Since there are more possible distributions for case 2, it is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.
