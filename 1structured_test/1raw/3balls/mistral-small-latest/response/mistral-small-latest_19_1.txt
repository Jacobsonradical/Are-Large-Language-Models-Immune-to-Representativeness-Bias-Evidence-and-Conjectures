{case: 2}

Explanation:

The total number of distinguishable ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is C(6,2,2,0) = 15 for case 1 and C(6,2,3,1) = 630 for case 2.

Since there are more possible ways to distribute the balls as in case 2, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 compared to case 1.
