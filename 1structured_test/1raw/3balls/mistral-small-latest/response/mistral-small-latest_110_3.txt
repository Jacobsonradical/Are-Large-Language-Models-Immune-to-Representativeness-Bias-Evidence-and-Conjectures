{case: 2, there will be more results of case 2}

Reasoning:
There are 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of distinguishable distributions is given by the number of ways to choose how many balls each child gets, which can be represented by the stars-and-bars method. In this case, there are 7 "bars" (2 between each child and 1 at each end) and 6 "stars" (the balls), making a total of 13 elements to arrange. The number of distributions is then given by the binomial coefficient C(13, 6) = 1716.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), there is only 1 way to distribute the balls in this manner.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), there are C(4,2) ways to distribute the balls, which is equal to 6.

Since 6 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
