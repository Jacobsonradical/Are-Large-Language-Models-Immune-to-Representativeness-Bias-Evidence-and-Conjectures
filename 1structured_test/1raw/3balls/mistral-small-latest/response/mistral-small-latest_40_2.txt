{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6C3 = 20 different ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children, considering each child as a distinct entity.

For case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2. This can be achieved in 6!/(2!2!2!) = 90 ways, considering the different arrangements of the balls within each child's set.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. This can be achieved in 6!/(2!3!1!) = 180 ways.

Since 180 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
