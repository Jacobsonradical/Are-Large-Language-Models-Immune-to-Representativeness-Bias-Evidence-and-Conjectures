{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
Let's calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case using combinations.

For case 1:
Each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C with 2 balls each is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6;2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2:
A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is:

C(6;2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since there are more outcomes for case 2 (60) than for case 1 (15), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
