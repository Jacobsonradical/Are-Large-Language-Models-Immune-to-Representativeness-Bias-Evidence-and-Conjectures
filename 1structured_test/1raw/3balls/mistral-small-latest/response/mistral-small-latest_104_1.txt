{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute the balls so that A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball, compared to distributing the balls equally among the three children.

The number of ways to distribute the balls in each case can be calculated using combinations:

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the multinomial coefficient C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15.

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute the balls is given by C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60.

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
