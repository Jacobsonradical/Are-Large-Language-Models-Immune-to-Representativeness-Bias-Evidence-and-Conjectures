{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In case 1, all three children receive 2 balls each. This is an even distribution and there is only 1 way this can happen.

In case 2, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3, and the last one gets 1. There are multiple ways this can happen due to the different combinations of children who could receive 2, 3, or 1 ball.

Specifically, there are 3 choices for the child who gets 2 balls, 3 choices for the child who gets 3 balls, and 1 choice left for the child who gets 1 ball. So, there are a total of 3 * 3 = 9 ways case 2 can occur.

Since there are more possibilities for case 2 to occur than for case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
