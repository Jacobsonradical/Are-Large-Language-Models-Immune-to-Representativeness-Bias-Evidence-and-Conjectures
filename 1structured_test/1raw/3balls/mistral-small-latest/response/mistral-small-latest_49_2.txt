{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

This is because case 1 requires each child to have an equal number of balls, which is a more specific outcome. In contrast, case 2 allows for more variability in the distribution of balls, making it more likely to occur.

To provide a numerical argument, let's consider the total number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. This can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method, which gives us a total of C(8,2) = 28 combinations.

For case 1, we need to distribute 2 balls to each child, which can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 ways.

For case 2, we need to distribute 2 balls to A, 3 balls to B, and 1 ball to C, which can be done in C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 30 ways.

Since 30 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
