{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 84 possible distributions of the 6 balls among the 3 children.

For case 1, the number of distributions where each child gets 2 balls is C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 900. However, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the balls within each group, which is 2!^3 = 8. So, the actual number of distributions for case 1 is 900 / 8 = 112.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a distribution, we round down to 112.

For case 2, the number of distributions is C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 900. Again, we need to divide by the number of permutations within each group, which is 2! * 3! * 1! = 12. So, the actual number of distributions for case 2 is 900 / 12 = 75.

Since 75 > 112, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
