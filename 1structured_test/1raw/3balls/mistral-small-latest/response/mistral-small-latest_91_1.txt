{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

There are a total of 6 choices for the first ball, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, 3 for the fourth, 2 for the fifth, and 1 for the sixth. So, there are a total of 6! (720) ways to distribute the balls.

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we can use the multinomial coefficient formula: 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270 ways.

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of ways is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 630 ways.

Since 630 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
