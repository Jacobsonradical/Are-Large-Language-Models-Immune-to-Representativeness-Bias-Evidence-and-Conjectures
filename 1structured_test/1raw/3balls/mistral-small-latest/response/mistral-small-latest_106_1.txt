{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because case 2 has more possible distributions of balls than case 1. Case 1 has a specific distribution of 2 balls to each child, which can occur in 15 ways (using combinations). Case 2 has a more flexible distribution, with 3 balls to B and 1 ball to C, which can occur in 60 ways (using combinations). Therefore, there are more possible outcomes for case 2 than for case 1, so case 2 will occur more frequently.}
