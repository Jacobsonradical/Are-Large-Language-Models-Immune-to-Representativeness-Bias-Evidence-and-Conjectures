{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
There are 6 balls and 3 children, so the total number of ways to distribute the balls is given by the combination formula C(n+r-1, r-1) = C(8, 2) = 28.

For case 1, there is only one way to distribute the balls so that each child has 2 balls.

For case 2, there are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to choose which 2 balls go to child A, and then 2 ways to choose which child gets the remaining ball (either B or C), so there are 15 * 2 = 30 ways to distribute the balls as in case 2.

Since 30 > 1, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
