{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of possible distributions can be calculated using the stars-and-bars method, which is a combination of 6 balls and 2 dividers, resulting in C(8,2) = 28 possible distributions.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This is equivalent to placing the 2 dividers between the 6 balls in 3! ways (since the balls are distinguishable), which gives us 6 possible distributions for case 1.

For case 2, there are more ways to distribute the balls. Specifically, we can choose 2 balls for child A in C(6,2) = 15 ways, then assign the remaining 4 balls to children B and C in 4! / (2!*1!) = 6 ways. So there are 15 * 6 = 90 possible distributions for case 2.

Since 90 > 6, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
