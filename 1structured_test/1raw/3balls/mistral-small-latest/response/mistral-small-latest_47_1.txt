{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.}

Explanation:

Let's calculate the probability of each case occurring:

1. For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), we have to distribute 6 balls such that each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270.
2. For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), we have to distribute 6 balls such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is C(6; 3, 2, 1) + C(6; 3, 1, 2) + C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 720.

The probability of case 1 is 270/720 = 0.375, and the probability of case 2 is 600/720 = 0.833. Since the probability of case 2 is higher, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.
