{case: 2, There are more results of case 2 than case 1.

To reason for this, let's compute the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case using the multinomial coefficient formula:

C(n; n_1, n_2, ..., n_k) = n! / (n_1! * n_2! * ... * n_k!)

where n is the total number of balls and n_1, n_2, ..., n_k are the numbers of balls given to each child.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways = C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 180

Since 180 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.}
