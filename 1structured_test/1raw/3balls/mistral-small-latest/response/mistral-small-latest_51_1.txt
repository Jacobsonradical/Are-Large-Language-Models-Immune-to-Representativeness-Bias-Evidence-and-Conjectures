The distribution of the balls follows a multinomial distribution. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among A, B, and C such that A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball is given by:

C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to achieve the distribution in case 1, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
