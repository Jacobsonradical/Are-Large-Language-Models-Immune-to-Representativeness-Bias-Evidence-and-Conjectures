{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula: C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2, the number of ways is C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 28.
For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1, the number of ways is C(6+3-1, 2) * C(2, 1) = 28 * 2 = 56.

Since 56 > 28, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
