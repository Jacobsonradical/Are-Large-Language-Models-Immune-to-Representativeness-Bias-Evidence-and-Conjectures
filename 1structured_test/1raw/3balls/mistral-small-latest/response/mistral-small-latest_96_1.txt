{case: 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of 6! = 720 ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children without restriction.

To find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula: C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!), where n = 6, r1 = r2 = r3 = 2.
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

To find the number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2, we can use the same formula: C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 630

Since 630 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
