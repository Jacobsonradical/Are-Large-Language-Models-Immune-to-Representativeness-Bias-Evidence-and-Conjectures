{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 84 possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1, there are C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) = 15 * 6 = 90 possible distributions, but this counts each distribution 3! times (due to the distinguishability of the children), so the actual number of distributions for case 1 is 90 / 3! = 15.

For case 2, there are C(6, 2) * C(4, 3) = 15 * 4 = 60 possible distributions. Again, since the children are distinguishable, we need to divide by 3! to get the actual number of distributions for case 2, which is 60 / 3! = 10.

Therefore, there are more distributions of case 2 (10) than case 1 (15) in many rounds of the game.
