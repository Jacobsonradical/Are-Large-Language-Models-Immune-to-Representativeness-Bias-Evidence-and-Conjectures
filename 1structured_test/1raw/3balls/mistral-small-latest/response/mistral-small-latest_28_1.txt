This is a problem of counting the number of possible distributions of balls, which can be solved using combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
Number of ways to distribute the balls in this case = C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 15 * 6 * 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Number of ways to distribute the balls in this case = C(6,2) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in case 1 than in case 2, we can expect that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

{case: 1}
