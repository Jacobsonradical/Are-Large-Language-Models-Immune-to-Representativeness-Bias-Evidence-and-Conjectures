{case: 2, there will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:
In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among three children. The total number of possible distributions can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient formula, which is n! / (n1! * n2! * n3!) where n is the total number of balls, and n1, n2, and n3 are the number of balls given to each child.

For case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of distributions for this case is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90

For case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of distributions for this case is 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 360

Comparing the two, there are more possible distributions for case 2 (360) than for case 1 (90). Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 2.
