{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2.}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children. The total number of ways to do this can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions allowed, which is C(n+r-1, r-1), where n is the number of items to distribute and r is the number of groups.

Total combinations = C(6+3-1, 3-1) = C(8, 2) = 28

Now let's calculate the number of combinations for each case:

Case 1: Each child gets 2 balls. This is equivalent to dividing the 6 balls into 3 pairs and giving each pair to a child. The number of ways to divide 6 balls into 3 pairs is C(5, 2) = 10.

Case 2: One child gets 1 ball, another gets 3 balls, and the last one gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this manner is 3 * C(5, 2) = 30, where 3 is the number of ways to choose the child who gets 1 ball.

Since 30 > 10, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
