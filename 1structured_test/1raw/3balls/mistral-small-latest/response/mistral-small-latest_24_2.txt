{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

Explanation:

In this problem, we are distributing 6 balls among 3 children. There are a total of C(n+r-1, r-1) ways to do this, where n is the number of balls and r is the number of children.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. This can be calculated as C(8,2) * C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 28 * 15 * 6 = 2520 ways.

For case 2, the distribution is 2, 3, 1. This can be calculated as C(8,2) * C(6,3) * C(3,1) = 28 * 20 * 3 = 1680 ways.

Since 1680 < 2520, in a single round, there are more ways for case 1 to occur. However, the question asks about many rounds of the game. In the long run, the distribution that can occur in more ways will occur more often. Therefore, even though there are more ways for case 1 to occur in a single round, there are still ways for case 2 to occur. Given enough rounds, the distribution that can occur in more total ways (even if fewer ways per round) will eventually become more common. In this case, that is case 2.
