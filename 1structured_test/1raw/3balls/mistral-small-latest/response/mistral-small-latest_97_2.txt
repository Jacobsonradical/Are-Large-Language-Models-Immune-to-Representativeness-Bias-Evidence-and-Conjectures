{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

In each round, the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is (6+3-1)! / (6! * 2!).

For case 1, the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to each child is (2!)^3 (since the two balls given to each child can be arranged in 2! ways).

For case 2, the number of ways to distribute 2, 3, and 1 balls to A, B, and C respectively is 2! * 3! * 1!.

By calculating these values, we find that there are more ways for case 2 to occur than for case 1. Therefore, in many rounds of the game, we will see more results of case 2 than case 1.
