The answer is {case: 2}.

There are a total of $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways to distribute 2 balls to one child, and $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to distribute 3 balls to another child, leaving 1 ball for the third child. So, there are $28 \cdot 20 = 560$ ways for case 2 to happen.

For case 1 to happen, each child must receive exactly 2 balls. There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the 2 balls for each child. Since A, B, and C are distinguishable, the total number of ways for case 1 to happen is $15 \cdot 15 \cdot 15 = 3375$.

Since 560 < 3375, there will be more results of case 1 in a single round. However, the question asks about many rounds of the game. Over multiple rounds, the more likely outcome will be the one with more possible combinations, which is case 2. Therefore, the answer is {case: 2}.
