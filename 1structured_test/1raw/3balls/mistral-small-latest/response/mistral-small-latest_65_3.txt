{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more possible combinations than case 1.

For case 1, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for each child, and since there are 3 children, the total number of combinations is [C(6,2)]^3.

For case 2, there are C(6,2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4,3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and only 1 way to give the remaining ball to child C. So, the total number of combinations for case 2 is C(6,2) * C(4,3).

When we compare these numbers, we find that C(6,2) * C(4,3) > [C(6,2)]^3. Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
