{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

To reason this, let's compute the number of ways each distribution can occur.

In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls to 3 children with 2 balls each is calculated using multinomial coefficients:

C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

In case 2, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute 6 balls in this way is:

C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 60

Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
