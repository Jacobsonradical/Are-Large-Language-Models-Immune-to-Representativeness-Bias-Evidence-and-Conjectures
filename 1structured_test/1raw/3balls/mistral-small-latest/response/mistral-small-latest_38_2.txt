{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

This is because case 1 requires all children to receive an equal number of balls, which is less likely given the random distribution. There are more ways to distribute 6 balls unequally between three children than equally. Case 2 is one example of an unequal distribution, and there are many other unequal distributions that would result in more balls for one child and fewer for another.
