{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2 than case 1. This is because case 2 has more possible distributions than case 1. Case 1 has all children receiving exactly 2 balls each, which has 15 possible distributions (choose 2 out of 6 for each child). Case 2 has one child receiving 1 ball, one child receiving 3 balls, and the other child receiving 2 balls, which has 60 possible distributions (choose 1 out of 6 for the child with 1 ball, choose 3 out of the remaining 5 for the child with 3 balls, and the remaining 2 balls go to the last child). Since 60 > 15, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.}
