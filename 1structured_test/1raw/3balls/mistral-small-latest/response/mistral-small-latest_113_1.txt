{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2}

There are a total of 6! (720) ways to distribute the 6 balls among the 3 children. We will calculate the number of ways for each case and compare them.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 2, 2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 270

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is the multinomial coefficient:
C(6; 2, 3, 1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 600

Since 600 > 270, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
