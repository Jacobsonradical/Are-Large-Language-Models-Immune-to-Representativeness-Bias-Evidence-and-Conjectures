{case: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

We have 6 distinguishable balls and 3 children. The total number of ways to distribute these balls among the children is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is $C(n; r_1, r_2, ..., r_k) = \frac{n!}{r_1!r_2!...r_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r_1, r_2, ..., r_k$ are the numbers of items in each group.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. So, the number of ways to distribute the balls is $C(6; 2, 2, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 900$.

For case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1. The number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is $C(6; 2, 3, 1) = \frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 600$.

Since 600 (case 2) is greater than 900 (case 1), there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
