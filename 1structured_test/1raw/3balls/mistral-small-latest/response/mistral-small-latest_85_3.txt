{case: 2}

There will be more results of case 2. This is because there are more ways to distribute 6 balls with the configuration A:2, B:3, C:1 than with the configuration A:2, B:2, C:2.

To see this, let's count the number of ways to distribute the balls in each case.

1. Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
   We can choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A in C(6,2) ways. Once we have placed 2 balls with child A, there are 4 balls left to distribute among B and C. We can choose 2 balls out of 4 for child B in C(4,2) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6,2) * C(4,2).

2. Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
   Similarly, we can choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A in C(6,2) ways. After giving 2 balls to child A, there are 4 balls left to distribute among B and C. We can choose 3 balls out of 4 for child B in C(4,3) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in this case is C(6,2) * C(4,3).

Using the combination formulas, we find that C(6,2) * C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90, and C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15 * 4 = 60.

Since 60 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1 in many rounds of the game.
