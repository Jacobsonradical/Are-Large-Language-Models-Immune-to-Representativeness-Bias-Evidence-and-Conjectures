The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient.

For case 1, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2,2,2) = 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 90.

For case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2,3,1) = 6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 150.

Since 150 > 90, there will be more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.

So, the answer is {case: 2}.
