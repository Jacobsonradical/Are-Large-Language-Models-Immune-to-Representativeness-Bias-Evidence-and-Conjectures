{case: 2, There will be more results of case 2. This is because case 2 has more possible distributions than case 1. In case 1, each child gets exactly 2 balls, and there is only 1 way to distribute them. In case 2, there are multiple ways to distribute the balls. Specifically, there are 15 ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that A gets 2, B gets 3, and C gets 1. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: C(6,2) * C(4,3) = 15.}
