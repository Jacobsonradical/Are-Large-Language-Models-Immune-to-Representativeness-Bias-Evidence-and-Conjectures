{case: 2, There are more results of case 2}

Explanation:
There are a total of C(6+3-1, 3-1) = 28 possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children without any restrictions.

For case 1, the number of ways is C(2+2-1, 2-1)^3 = 3^3 = 27.
For case 2, the number of ways is C(2+3-1, 2-1) * C(1+3-1, 1-1) = 10 * 3 = 30.

Since 30 > 27, there are more results of case 2 in many rounds of the game.
