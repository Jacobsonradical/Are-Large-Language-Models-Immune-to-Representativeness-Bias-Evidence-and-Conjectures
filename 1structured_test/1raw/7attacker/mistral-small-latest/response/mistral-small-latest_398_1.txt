{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time in similar conditions, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller can be calculated as: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This probability is: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, according to the witness and the population statistics, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.76 or 76%.}
