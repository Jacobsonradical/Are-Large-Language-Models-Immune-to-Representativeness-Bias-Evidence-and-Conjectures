{probability: 0.76,

Explanation:
Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct in judging a person's height, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

However, we also know that only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So, we need to account for this base rate.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = [P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall)] / P(witness says tall)

P(attacker is tall) = 0.15 (from the information)
P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
P(witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness says tall | attacker is not tall) * P(attacker is not tall)

Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(witness says tall | attacker is not tall) = 0.2. And since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(attacker is not tall) = 0.85.

So, P(witness says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.22

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.76 or 76%}
