{probability: 0.56, The attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate. Given that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.8 (accuracy) * 0.15 (percentage of tall people) = 0.12. However, we must also account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being tall. This would be 0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (percentage of shorter people) = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.56.}
