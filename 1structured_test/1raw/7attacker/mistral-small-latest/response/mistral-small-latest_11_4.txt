{probability: 0.87, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: 0.15 (probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying the height) = 0.12 or 12%. However, the question asks for the probability given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy), and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.14 + 0.17 = 0.31. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.31 = 0.87 (rounded to two decimal places).}
