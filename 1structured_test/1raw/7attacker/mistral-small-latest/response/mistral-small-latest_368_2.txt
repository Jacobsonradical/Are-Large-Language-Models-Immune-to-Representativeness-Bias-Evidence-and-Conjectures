{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying height, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (population percentage) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height. To find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, we need to divide this by the probability that the witness would make a correct identification, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This probability is 0.5 (since half of the sample people were 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.4. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / 0.4 = 0.64 or 64%.}
