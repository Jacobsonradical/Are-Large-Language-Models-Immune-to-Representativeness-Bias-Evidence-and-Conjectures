{probability: 0.58,

Here's the reasoning:
Let's assume the attacker's height is a random variable, and we want to find the probability that it is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and accuracy.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(W|A) and P(A), and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the witness makes errors in 20% of cases, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.58.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58.}
