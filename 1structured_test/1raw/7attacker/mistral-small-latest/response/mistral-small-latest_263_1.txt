Based on the information provided, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

First, we have the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).

The witness correctly identified the attacker's height with a probability of 0.8 (80% of the time under similar conditions).

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, can be calculated as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness said so) = P(witness said so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness said so)

P(witness said so) = P(witness said so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness said so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

The probability that the witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter, is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2 (20% of the time).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(witness said so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Finally, substituting this into the first equation, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness said so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.571.

Answer: {probability: 0.571}
