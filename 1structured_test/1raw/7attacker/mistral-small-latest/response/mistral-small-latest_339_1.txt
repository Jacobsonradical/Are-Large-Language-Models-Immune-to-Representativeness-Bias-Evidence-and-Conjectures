{probability: 0.84, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes mistakes 20% of the time, which means there's a 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 probability that the attacker is actually shorter but was identified as taller. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 84% when expressed as a percentage.}
