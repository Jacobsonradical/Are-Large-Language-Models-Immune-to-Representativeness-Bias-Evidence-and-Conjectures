{probability: 0.7, Based on the information provided, the witness has an 80% accuracy at identifying people's height. Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, if the attacker was randomly selected from the population, there would be a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust this probability for the witness's accuracy. So, 15% chance * 80% accuracy = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made a correct identification out of the 20% of cases where the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, this would be 85% * 20% = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.}
