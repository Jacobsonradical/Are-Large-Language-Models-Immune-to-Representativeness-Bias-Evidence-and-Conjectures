{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is 80% accurate in identifying heights under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness made a positive identification of the attacker's height, so we need to adjust for this. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall person is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, while the probability of incorrectly identifying a short person as tall is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. The total probability of the witness identifying a person as tall is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.76.}
