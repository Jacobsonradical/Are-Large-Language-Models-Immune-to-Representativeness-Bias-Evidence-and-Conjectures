{probability: 0.46}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the attacker is a random person from the city population. Given the information in (b), there's a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. According to (a), the witness is correct 80% of the time when making this identification.
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.15 (the base rate) multiplied by 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
4. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 0.46 when expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1.
