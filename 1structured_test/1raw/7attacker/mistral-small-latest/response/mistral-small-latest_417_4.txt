{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, based on the city's population distribution.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying the height correctly. So, if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will identify him correctly.
3. However, there's also a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
4. To find the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement), we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the witness's statement.
5. P(B|A) is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8. P(A) is the prior probability, which is 0.15. P(B) is the total probability of the witness making that statement, which is the sum of the probability of the witness being correct (0.15 * 0.8) and the probability of the witness making an error (0.85 * 0.2).
6. So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2) â‰ˆ 0.64.
