{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: The witness has an 80% chance of being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance of being correct when the attacker is shorter (false positive). Since 85% of the population is shorter, the false positive rate is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. The attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is therefore 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.68.}
