{probability: 0.46, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and they are correct in 80% of their identifications. However, only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.46.}
