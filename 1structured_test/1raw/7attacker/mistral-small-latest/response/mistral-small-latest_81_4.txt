Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated by considering both the distribution of heights in the population and the witness's accuracy.

The base rate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to the population distribution, is 0.15.

The witness's accuracy is 80%, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

To find the overall probability, we multiply these two probabilities together:

0.15 (base rate) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
