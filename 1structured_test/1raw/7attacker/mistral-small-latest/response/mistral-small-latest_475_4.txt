{probability: 0.68, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem, where the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the posterior probability is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.68.}
