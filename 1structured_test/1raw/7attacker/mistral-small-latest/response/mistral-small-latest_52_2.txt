{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter but the witness made an error. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes errors 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
