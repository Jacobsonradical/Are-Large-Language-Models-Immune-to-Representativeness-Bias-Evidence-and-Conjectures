{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying height, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 15% * 80% = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of misidentifying a shorter person as tall. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of misidentifying a short person as tall is 85% * 20% = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these probabilities together, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 12% + 17% = 0.56 or 56%.}
