{probability: 0.904, This estimate is calculated as follows: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height would be 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, since the attacker was indeed taller than 185 cm (according to the witness), we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. This error occurs 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% of the population. So, the probability of this error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Given that these are the only two possibilities (the witness was correct or made an error), the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (error identification) = 0.904 or 90.4%.}
