{probability: 0.72, Considering that the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying height, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72.}
