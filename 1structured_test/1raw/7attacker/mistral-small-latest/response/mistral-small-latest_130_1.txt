Based on the information given, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:

E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(E): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).
P(W|E): The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information a).
P(W|not E): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (because the witness makes an error 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states that P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / [P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)].

P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85 (from information b).

So, P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.47.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.47.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.47}.
