Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

1. The probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%, according to information "a".
2. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when given a sample of people with an equal distribution of heights shorter and taller than 185 cm, according to information "b".
3. Since the witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can consider this as a positive identification. Given the witness's accuracy rate, the probability of a correct identification is 80%.
4. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller is the product of the two probabilities: 15% (city population) \* 80% (witness accuracy) = 0.15 \* 0.8 = 0.12.

So, the estimate is: {probability: 0.12}
