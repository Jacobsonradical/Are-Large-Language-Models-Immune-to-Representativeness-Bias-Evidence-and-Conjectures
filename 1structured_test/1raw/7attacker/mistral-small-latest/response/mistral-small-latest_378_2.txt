{probability: 0.69, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and given their 80% accuracy rate, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 0.69. This is calculated by multiplying the witness's accuracy (0.8) by the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller (0.15).}
