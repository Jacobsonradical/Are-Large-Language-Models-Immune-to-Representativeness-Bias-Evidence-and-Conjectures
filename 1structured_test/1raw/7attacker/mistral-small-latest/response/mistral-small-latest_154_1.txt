{probability: 0.784, Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker is likely from the 15% of the population that is 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Given that half the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this error is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10 or 10%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22 or 22%. However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, not the probability that the witness identified the attacker as such. To find this, we need to divide our estimate by the probability that the witness is correct (whether the attacker is tall or not), which is 80%. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.22 / 0.80 = 0.784 or 78.4%.}
