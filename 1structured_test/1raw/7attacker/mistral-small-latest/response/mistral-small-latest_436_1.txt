{probability: 0.52, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker is shorter is 0.2 (also from a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.52.}
