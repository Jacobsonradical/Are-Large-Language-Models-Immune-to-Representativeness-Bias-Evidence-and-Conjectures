{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, and half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the estimated probability of this error is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.64.}
