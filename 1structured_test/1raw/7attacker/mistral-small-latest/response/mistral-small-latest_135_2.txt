{probability: 0.43, This calculation involves using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness is 80% accurate, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed that tall is approximately 0.43. This is calculated as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)}
