{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. However, only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.64.}
