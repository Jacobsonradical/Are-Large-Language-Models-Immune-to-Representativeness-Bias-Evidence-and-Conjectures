{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we can assume that the witness's statement is correct with a probability of 0.8. Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(W|not A) = 0.2. We know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.64.}
