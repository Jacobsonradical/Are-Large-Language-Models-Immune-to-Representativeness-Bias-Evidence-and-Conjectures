{probability: 0.78, given the information provided}

Explanation:
1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time in similar conditions.
3. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that tall, is 0.80.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such: P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W).
5. In this case, P(T) is 0.15, P(W|T) is 0.80. P(W) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification (0.15 * 0.80) and an incorrect identification of a shorter person (0.85 * 0.20), which equals 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.
6. Therefore, P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.78. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.78.
