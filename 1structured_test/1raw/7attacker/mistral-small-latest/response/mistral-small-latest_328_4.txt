{probability: 0.68, based on the given information, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is 80% accurate in such judgments. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this would translate to an estimated probability of 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 for the attacker being 185 cm or taller if chosen randomly from the population. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to adjust for the witness's accuracy. This can be done using Bayes' theorem, resulting in an estimated probability of 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.68}
