{probability: 0.86, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.86. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying height (0.80), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a shorter person as being shorter (0.50 * 0.80 = 0.40), which equals 0.52. So, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52 / 0.62, which is about 0.86.}
