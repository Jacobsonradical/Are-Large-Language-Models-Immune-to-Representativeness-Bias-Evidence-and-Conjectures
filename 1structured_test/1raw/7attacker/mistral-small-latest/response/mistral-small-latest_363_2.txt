Based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

First, we need to consider the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's performance, this probability is 0.8.

Then, we need to consider the base rate of the population, which is that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = [P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness says so)

Since the witness says so in 80% of the cases (regardless of the actual height), we have P(witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.29

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is: {probability: 0.4138}
