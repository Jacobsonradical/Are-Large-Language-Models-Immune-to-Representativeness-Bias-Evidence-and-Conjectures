Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of A given B.

From the information, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

The witness's accuracy is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).

The witness's error rate is 20%, so if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.4285714286

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4285714286.

Answer: {probability: 0.4285714286}
