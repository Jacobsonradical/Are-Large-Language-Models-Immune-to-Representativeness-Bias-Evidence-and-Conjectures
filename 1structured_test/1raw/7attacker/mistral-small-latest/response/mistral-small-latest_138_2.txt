{probability: 0.52, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.80), which gives an estimate of 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This would be the probability of the witness making an error (0.20) multiplied by the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm (0.85), which gives an estimate of 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives a final estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.52 or 52%.}
