{probability: 0.68, Given the witness's accuracy rate and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the witness being correct (0.8) by the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15).}
