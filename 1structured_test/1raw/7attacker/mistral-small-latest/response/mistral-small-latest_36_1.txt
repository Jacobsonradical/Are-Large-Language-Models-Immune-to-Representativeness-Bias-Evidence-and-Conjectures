Based on the information provided:

The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller when the person actually is that tall.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, can be calculated using conditional probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as such) = P(witness is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

This gives us: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

{probability: 0.12}
