{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there is also a chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identified them as taller. This probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.}
