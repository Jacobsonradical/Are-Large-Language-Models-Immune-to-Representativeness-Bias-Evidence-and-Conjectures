Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness correctly identified height in 80% of cases. Given that 50% of the sample had a height of 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4.

However, this does not take into account the overall distribution of heights in the city. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we should adjust our estimate.

So, the final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4 / 0.15 = approximately 2.67.

Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, we can interpret this result as the witness's identification increasing the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller by about 2.67 times compared to the general population. However, the actual probability cannot exceed 1, so we should still consider the attacker to be 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.15, given the limitations of the witness's ability to judge height.

Therefore, the estimate is: {probability: 0.15}
