{probability: 0.68, Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller and has an 80% accuracy rate in conditions similar to that night, and considering that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, the probability can be estimated using Bayes' theorem as follows: P(taller|identified as taller) = P(identified as taller|taller) * P(taller) / P(identified as taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.68}
