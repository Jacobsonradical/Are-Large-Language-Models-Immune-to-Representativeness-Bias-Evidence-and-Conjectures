{probability: 0.93, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate. Given that the attacker is likely to be from the 15% of the population who are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller by multiplying the proportion of tall people (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8). This gives us approximately 0.93 or 93%.}
