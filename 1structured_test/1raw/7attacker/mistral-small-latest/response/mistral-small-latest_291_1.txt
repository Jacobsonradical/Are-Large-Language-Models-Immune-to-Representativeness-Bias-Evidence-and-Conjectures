{probability: 0.68, based on Bayes' Theorem calculation}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From information b, P(A) = 0.15.
2. Let P(W|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 80% from information a, so P(W|A) = 0.8.
3. Let P(W|not A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate, so P(W|not A) = 0.2.
4. Let P(not A) be the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information b, P(not A) = 0.85.
5. By Bayes' Theorem, P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.68.

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.68.
