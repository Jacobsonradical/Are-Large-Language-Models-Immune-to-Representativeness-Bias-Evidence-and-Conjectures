{probability: 0.68, given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying a person's height, and considering that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12, with a false positive rate of 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, but since the witness only testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the base rate of 15% in the population, resulting in 0.29 / 0.15 = 0.68.}
