{probability: 0.92, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (probability of correct identification) times 0.15 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the city's population distribution), which equals 0.92.}
