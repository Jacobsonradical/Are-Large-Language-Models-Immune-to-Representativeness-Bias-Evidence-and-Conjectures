{probability: 0.52, Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time with people of 185 cm or taller and there is a 15% chance of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, considering the witness's error rate of 20%, the probability of the attacker being misidentified as being 185 cm or taller is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the overall estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.52.}
