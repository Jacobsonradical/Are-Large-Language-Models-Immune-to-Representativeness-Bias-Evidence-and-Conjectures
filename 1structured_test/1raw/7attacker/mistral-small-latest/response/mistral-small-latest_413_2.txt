{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the attacker is in the 15% of the population who are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the question asks for the estimate of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statement. We need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error when the person is actually 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.20. So, the probability that the witness identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%. Given the witness statement, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is therefore 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.62 or 62%.}
