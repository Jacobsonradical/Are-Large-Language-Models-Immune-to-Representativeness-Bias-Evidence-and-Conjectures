{probability: 0.73, This estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem, considering the witness' accuracy and the general population distribution. The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and given their 80% accuracy in similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.73.}
