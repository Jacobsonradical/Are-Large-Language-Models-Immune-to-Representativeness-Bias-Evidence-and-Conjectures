{probability: 0.76}

Explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness can correctly identify the height, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. The attacker is either part of the 15% of the population who are 185 cm or taller (true positive), or part of the 85% of the population who are shorter but incorrectly identified as being 185 cm or taller (false positive).
2. The probability of a true positive is 0.15 (15% of the population) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12.
3. The probability of a false positive is 0.85 (85% of the population) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17.
4. The total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, considering both true and false positives, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
5. However, since the question asks for an estimate based on the witness's identification, we should consider the witness's accuracy in this scenario. Therefore, we can adjust our estimate by multiplying the total probability by the witness's accuracy: 0.29 * 0.8 = 0.76.
