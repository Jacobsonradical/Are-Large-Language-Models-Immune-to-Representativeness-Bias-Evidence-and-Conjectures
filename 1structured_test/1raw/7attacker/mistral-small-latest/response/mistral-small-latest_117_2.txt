{probability: 0.73, Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy under similar conditions is 80%. The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the general population distribution, is 15%. Using these figures, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.73 or 73%.}
