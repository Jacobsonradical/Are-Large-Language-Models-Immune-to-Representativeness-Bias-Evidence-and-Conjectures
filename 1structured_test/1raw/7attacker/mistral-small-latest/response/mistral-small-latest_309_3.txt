{probability: 0.84, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm. Given the information b, P(A) = 0.15. Let P(W|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually taller. This is 0.8 according to information a. Similarly, let P(W|not A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually not taller. This is 0.2 according to information a. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is taller given that the witness identified him as such. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A)*P(A) / [P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|not A)*P(not A)], which simplifies to about 0.84.}
