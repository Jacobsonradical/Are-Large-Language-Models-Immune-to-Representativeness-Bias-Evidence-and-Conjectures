{probability: 0.77, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller is 15%, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem. The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the likelihood given that the attacker is shorter is 0.2. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.77.}
