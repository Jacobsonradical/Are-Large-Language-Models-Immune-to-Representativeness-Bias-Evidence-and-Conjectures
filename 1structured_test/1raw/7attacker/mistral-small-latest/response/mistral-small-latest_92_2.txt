{probability: 0.92, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness who is correct 80% of the time, and the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.92.}
