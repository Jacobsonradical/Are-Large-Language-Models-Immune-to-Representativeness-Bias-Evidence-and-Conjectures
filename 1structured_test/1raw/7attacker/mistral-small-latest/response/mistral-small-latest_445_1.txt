{probability: 0.904, explanation: The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated by taking into account the witness' accuracy in identifying height and the population statistics. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.904 or 90.4%.}
