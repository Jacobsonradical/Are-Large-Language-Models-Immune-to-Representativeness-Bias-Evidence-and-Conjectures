{probability: 0.56, The attacker was identified by the witness as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy of 80%, this means there is an 80% chance that the witness was correct. However, the attacker's height is also constrained by the population distribution in the city. Since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we multiply the witness's accuracy of 80% by the population probability of 15% to get a final estimate of 0.56 or 56%.}
