{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: 15% (population proportion) * 80% (witness accuracy) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the witness's errors as well. The witness will incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (since 50% of the sample was shorter than 185 cm). So, the probability of this error is 50% * 20% = 0.10 or 10%. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.10 (incorrect identification) = 0.22 or 22%. However, this is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probability we're looking for is (0.12 / 0.22) = 0.545 or approximately 0.62.}
