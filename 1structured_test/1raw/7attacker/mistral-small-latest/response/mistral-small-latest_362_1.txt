{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. This would be 0.85 (probability that the person is shorter) * 0.2 (probability of witness error). So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
