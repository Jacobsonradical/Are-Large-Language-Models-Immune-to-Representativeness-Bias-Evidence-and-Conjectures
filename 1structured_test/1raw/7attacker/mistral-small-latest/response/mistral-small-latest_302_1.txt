{probability: 0.82, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% and the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.82. This is calculated as the product of the witness's accuracy (0.8) and the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15), which equals 0.12. Then, this value is divided by the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is the sum of the probability of a correct identification for a person who is 185 cm or taller (0.12) and the probability of a false positive (0.36, which is 0.2 error rate times 0.85 proportion of population shorter than 185 cm), which equals 0.48. So, 0.12 / 0.48 = 0.82.}
