{probability: 0.68, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate when identifying people of this height (0.8), resulting in an estimated probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness only saw the attacker and not a random person from the population, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so is higher than the base rate. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want P(A|W), which is equal to P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W). We know P(A) = 0.15, P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), and P(W) can be calculated as P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25. Therefore, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25 = 0.68.}
