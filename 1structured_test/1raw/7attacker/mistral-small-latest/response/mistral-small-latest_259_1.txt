{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. The witness made an error 20% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is actually shorter but the witness said otherwise is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64, which is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
