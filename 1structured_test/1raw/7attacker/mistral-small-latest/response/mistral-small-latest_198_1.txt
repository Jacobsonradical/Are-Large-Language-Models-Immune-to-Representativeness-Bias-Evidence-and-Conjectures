{probability: 0.66, This is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.66.}
