{probability: 0.875, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as follows: 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability of witness being correct) = 0.12. However, this does not account for the possibility of the witness making a mistake in identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, the probability of the witness misidentifying a short person is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.875 or 87.5% that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.}
