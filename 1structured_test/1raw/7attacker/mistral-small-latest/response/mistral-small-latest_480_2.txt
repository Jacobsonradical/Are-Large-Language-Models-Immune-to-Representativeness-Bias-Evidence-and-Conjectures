{probability: 0.72,

Explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A).

- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying someone shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of people in the city who are shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22 + 0.17 = 0.39

Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.39 â‰ˆ 0.72}
