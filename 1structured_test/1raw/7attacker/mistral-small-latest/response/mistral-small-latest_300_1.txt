{probability: 0.64,
Here's the reasoning: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our starting probability. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so we multiply these two probabilities together to get 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness can also incorrectly identify a shorter person as being taller. Since half the population is shorter, this gives us 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correctly identified) + 0.1 (incorrectly identified) = 0.64.}
