Based on the information provided, using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be approximately 0.47, or 47%.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
2. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.
3. From Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W).
4. From the information, P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller).
5. From the information, P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller).
6. To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A).
7. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, P(W|not A) = 0.2.
8. And from the information, P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of people in the city who are shorter than 185 cm).
9. Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41.
10. Finally, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.47.
