Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller (from information a).
2. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time under similar conditions (from information b).
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
4. To find the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we multiply the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

The estimated probability is: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
