{probability: 0.69, The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 15%. Given these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. The calculation is as follows: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.69.}
