{probability: 0.86, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the witness's error rate, which is 20% of the time they misidentify someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not. The probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. But since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, not the probability that the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to correct for the witness's false positives. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, so the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.86.}
