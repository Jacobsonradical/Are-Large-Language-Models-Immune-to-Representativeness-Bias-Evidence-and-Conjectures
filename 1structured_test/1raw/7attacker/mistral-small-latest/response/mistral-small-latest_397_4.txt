{probability: 0.84, based on the given information and assuming the witness and the attacker are from the same population}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height.
3. To find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height, we multiply the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by the witness's accuracy rate: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. However, there is also a chance that the witness made an error and identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This probability is the product of the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) and the witness's error rate (0.2): 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
5. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.84.
