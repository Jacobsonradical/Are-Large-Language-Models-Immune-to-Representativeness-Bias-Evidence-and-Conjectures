Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

First, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

Then, we have the witness's accuracy in identifying height. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

To find the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement), we can use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability = (Likelihood * Prior probability) / (Likelihood * Prior probability + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior probability))

Plugging in the numbers:

Posterior probability = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.4615

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.4615}
