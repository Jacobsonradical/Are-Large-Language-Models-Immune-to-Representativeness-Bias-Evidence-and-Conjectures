{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness was correct. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.58.}
