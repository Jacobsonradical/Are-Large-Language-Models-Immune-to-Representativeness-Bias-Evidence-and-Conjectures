{probability: 0.76,

Explanation: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population is 0.15. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is P(attacker tall|witness says tall) = [P(witness says tall|attacker tall) * P(attacker tall)] / P(witness says tall) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.76}
