{probability: 0.67, explanation: The witness's accuracy rate is 80%, and they identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This means that if the attacker were actually 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them. However, since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for this. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as such. Then P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W). We know P(W|A) = 0.8 (80%), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population), and P(W) = P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|not A)*P(not A). Since P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population), and assuming the witness has the same 20% error rate for identifying shorter people, P(W|not A) = 0.2. Plugging these values into the equation, we get P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.67 or 67%.}
