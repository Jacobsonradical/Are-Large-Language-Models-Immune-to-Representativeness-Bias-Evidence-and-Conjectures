{probability: 0.96, This is calculated as follows: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the witness is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time). Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually this tall is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter but the witness made an error. This is 0.2 (the error rate) times 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter). So the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.96.}
