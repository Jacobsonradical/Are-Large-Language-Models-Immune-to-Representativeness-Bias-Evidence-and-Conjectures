{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying the height under similar conditions, we can assume that the 80% of the time the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, that person is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this means that when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there's a 15/80 = 0.64 probability that the person is actually that tall.}
