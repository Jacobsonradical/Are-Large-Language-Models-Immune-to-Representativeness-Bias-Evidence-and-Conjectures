{probability: 0.56, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are looking for P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). From the given information, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.56.}
