{probability: 0.92, explanation: The witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases. However, since the attacker was more likely to be shorter than 185 cm due to the population distribution, the witness had a higher chance of correctly identifying a taller attacker. Therefore, we need to adjust for this. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness identified the attacker as taller. This means we are considering the scenario where the witness was correct. So, the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.92.}
