Explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies height, even when half of the sample is shorter than 185 cm and half is 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the witness is more likely to be correct when identifying a taller person in the 15% of the population that is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to use Bayes' theorem to account for this information. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. P(A) = 0.15, P(W|A) = 0.80, and P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller). Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A)P(A)/(P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|not A)P(not A)) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.76}
