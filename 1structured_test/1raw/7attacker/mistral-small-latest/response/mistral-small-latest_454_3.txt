{probability: 0.5625, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy of 80%, we can assume that the true probability is higher than 80%. The base rate of the population is that 15% are 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.5625 or 56.25%.}
