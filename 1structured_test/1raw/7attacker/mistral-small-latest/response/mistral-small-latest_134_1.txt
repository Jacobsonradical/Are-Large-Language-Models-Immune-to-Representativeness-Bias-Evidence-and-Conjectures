{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness was correct. However, we also know that only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (proportion of taller people in the city) = 0.12 or 12%. But since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. Then P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W). We know P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (proportion of taller people), and P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23. So, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
