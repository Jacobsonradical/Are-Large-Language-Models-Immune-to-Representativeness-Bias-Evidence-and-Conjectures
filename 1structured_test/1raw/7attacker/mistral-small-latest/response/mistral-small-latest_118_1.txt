Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the problem, we have:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying the attacker's height when he is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height when he is actually shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of a random person in the city being shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       â‰ˆ 0.45

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.45}.
