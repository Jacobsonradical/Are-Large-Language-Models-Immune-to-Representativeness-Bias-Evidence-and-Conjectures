{probability: 0.76, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the witness (80%) with the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (15%). So, 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness has a 20% chance of making an error, we need to consider that the attacker might actually be shorter than 185 cm. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually shorter is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the true positive probability (12%) minus the false positive probability (17%), which equals 0.12 - 0.17 = -0.05. Since probabilities can't be negative, we adjust this to 0 (meaning there's no evidence either way) but given the witness's testimony, we can say there's a 76% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller (12/(12+17) * 100%).}
