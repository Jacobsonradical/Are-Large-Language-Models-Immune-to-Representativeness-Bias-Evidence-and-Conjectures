{probability: 0.92, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.92. This is calculated as follows: the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so there's an 80% chance they were correct about the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for this. So, 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) multiplied by 0.15 (the proportion of the population that's 185 cm or taller) equals 0.12. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.92. This is calculated by adding the 0.12 (the probability that the witness was correct) to the 0.15 (the base rate in the population).}
