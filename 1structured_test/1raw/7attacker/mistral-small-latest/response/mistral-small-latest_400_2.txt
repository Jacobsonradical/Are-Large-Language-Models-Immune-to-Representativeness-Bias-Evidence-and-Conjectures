{probability: 0.75,
Given the information, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the distribution of heights in the city. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, and the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), which is the probability of A given W.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

We know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller), P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city), and P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is an error, which occurs 20% of the time, so P(W|not A) = 0.2. P(not A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.75

So, there's a 75% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
