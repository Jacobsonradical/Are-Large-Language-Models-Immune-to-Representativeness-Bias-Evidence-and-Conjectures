Here's the reasoning:

1. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the height and a 20% chance of making an error.
2. In a population where half are 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
3. However, in the actual population, only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
4. To account for this, we need to adjust our probability. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that only 15% of the population is this tall, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
5. But we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this error is 0.2 (20% chance of error) * 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.17.
6. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, taking into account both the witness's correct identification and possible error, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64 or 64%.
