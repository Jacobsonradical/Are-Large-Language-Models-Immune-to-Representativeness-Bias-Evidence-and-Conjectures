{probability: 0.916, or 91.6%}

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the general population, is 15%.
2. The witness's accuracy rate in identifying height is 80%.
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that tall, is 0.80.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such):
   Posterior probability = (Likelihood * Prior probability) / (Likelihood * Prior probability + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior probability))
   Posterior probability = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.916 or 91.6%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.916 or 91.6%.
