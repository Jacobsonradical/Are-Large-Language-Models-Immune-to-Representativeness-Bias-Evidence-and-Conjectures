{probability: 0.72, based on the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying height}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the city's population distribution, is 15%.
2. The witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time in similar conditions.
3. To find the posterior probability (i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185+ | witness says 185+) = [P(witness says 185+ | attacker is 185+) * P(attacker is 185+)] / P(witness says 185+)

4. We are given that P(witness says 185+ | attacker is 185+) = 0.8 and P(attacker is 185+) = 0.15.
5. P(witness says 185+) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(witness says 185+) = P(witness says 185+ | attacker is 185+) * P(attacker is 185+) + P(witness says 185+ | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

6. P(witness says 185+ | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies height in 80% of cases).
7. P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(attacker is 185+) = 0.85.
8. Plugging in the values, we get P(witness says 185+) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.23.
9. Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we get P(attacker is 185+ | witness says 185+) â‰ˆ 0.72.
