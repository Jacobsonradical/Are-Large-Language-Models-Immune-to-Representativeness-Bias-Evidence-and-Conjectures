{probability: 0.61, This estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall is 0.8 (from information a). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (false positive rate from information a). So, the posterior probability, which is our estimate, is calculated as (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.61.}
