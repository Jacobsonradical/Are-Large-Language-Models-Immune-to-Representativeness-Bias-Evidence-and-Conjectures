{probability: 0.66, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), the likelihood is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), and the posterior probability is approximately 0.66.}
