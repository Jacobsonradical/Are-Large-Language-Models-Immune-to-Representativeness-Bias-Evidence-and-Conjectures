{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the city (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying people of that height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%, but we need to account for the witness's errors in identifying shorter people as taller. Given that half the sample was shorter than 185 cm, and the witness made errors 20% of the time, the probability of a false positive is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 or 10%. Adding the true positive rate (12%) and the false positive rate (10%) gives us an estimated probability of 0.68 or 68%.}
