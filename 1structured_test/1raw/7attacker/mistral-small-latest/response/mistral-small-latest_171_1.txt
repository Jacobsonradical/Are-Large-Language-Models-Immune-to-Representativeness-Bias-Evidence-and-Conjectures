{probability: 0.65, This estimate is calculated by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying the attacker's height and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is actually this tall is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could have also misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.65.}
