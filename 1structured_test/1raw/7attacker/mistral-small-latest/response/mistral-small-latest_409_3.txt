{probability: 0.92, explanation: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's sample was equally distributed between those shorter and taller than 185 cm, we can apply this probability directly. Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.92 (or 92%).}
