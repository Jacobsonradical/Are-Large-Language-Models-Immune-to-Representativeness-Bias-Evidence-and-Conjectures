{probability: 0.64,

explanation:
Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our initial probability. However, we need to account for the witness's accuracy in identifying height. According to the data, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. So, we multiply the initial probability (0.15) by the witness's accuracy (0.8) to get the final probability. Therefore, the estimate is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.64 or 64%.}
