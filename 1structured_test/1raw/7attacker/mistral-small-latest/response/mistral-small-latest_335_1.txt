{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, since the witness also makes mistakes, and 20% of the time they incorrectly identify shorter people as taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is shorter but identified as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.58.}
