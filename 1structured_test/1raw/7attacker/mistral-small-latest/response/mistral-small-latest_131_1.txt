{probability: 0.52, Given that the witness is 80% accurate in identifying height, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to consider the inverse probability. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.52}
