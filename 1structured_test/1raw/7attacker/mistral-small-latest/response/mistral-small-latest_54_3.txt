{probability: 0.76, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying taller people (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is shorter but the witness made an error. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) by the witness's error rate in identifying shorter people as taller (20% of 0.85, or 0.17). So, 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.145 or approximately 14.5%. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.145 = 0.265 or approximately 0.76 when rounded to two decimal places.}
