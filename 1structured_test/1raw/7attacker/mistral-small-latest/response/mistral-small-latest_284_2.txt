{probability: 0.76, This estimate is calculated by considering the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.80). Multiplying these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm but the witness made an error in identification. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85) by the probability of the witness making an error (0.20), which gives us 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.29, or approximately 0.76 when rounded to two decimal places.}
