{probability: 0.46, Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the actual proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the population is 15%, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This results in an estimated probability of 0.46.}
