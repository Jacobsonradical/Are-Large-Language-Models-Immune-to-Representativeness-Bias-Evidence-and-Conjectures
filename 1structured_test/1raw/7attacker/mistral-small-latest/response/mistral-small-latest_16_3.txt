{probability: 0.59, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness errors in 20% of the cases). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.59.}
