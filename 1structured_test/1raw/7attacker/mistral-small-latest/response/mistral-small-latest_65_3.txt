Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote the event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values: P(A|B) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
