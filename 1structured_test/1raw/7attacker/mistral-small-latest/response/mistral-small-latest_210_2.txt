{probability: 0.78, The witness correctly identified height in 80% of the cases when half the sample was 185 cm or taller. Since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height in these cases 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made a mistake in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness makes mistakes in 20% of cases and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this mistake is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to adjust for this additional information. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want P(A|B), which is equal to P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying taller people), and P(B) can be calculated as P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.235. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.235 â‰ˆ 0.78.}
