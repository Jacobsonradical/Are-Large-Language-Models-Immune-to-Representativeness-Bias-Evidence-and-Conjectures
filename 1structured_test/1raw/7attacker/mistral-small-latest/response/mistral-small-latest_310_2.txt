{probability: 0.92,

Explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct in judging the height of a person, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Assuming the witness's accuracy is independent of the height distribution in the population, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) =
Probability(Witness is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / Probability(Witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from information a).

The event "Witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller" includes two possibilities: the witness is correct, or the witness makes an error but identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of the latter event is:

Probability(Witness makes error and identifies shorter person) =
Probability(Witness makes error | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * Probability(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) =
0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, Probability(Witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Probability(Witness is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + Probability(Witness makes error and identifies shorter person) =
0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.21

Finally, Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.92}
