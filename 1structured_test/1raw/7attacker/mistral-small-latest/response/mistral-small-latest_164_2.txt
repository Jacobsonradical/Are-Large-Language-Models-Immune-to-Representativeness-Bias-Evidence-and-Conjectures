Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let P(A) be the probability that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.
Let P(E) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information a.
Let P(E|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the person actually is 185 cm or taller. This is also 0.8 according to information a.

The probability we want to find is P(A|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

P(E) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a person's height, whether the person is actually 185 cm or taller (P(E|A) * P(A)) or shorter (P(E|not A) * P(not A)). Since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases when the person is shorter, P(E|not A) = 0.2. And P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Therefore, P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.5217

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.522.

Answer: {probability: 0.522}
