Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.
- P(W|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 according to information a.
- P(W|not A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time and the witness sees an equal number of people above and below 185 cm, this error will be equally distributed. So, P(W|not A) = 0.1.
- P(not A): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (1 - P(A)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)

The calculated probability is approximately 0.54.

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.54}.
