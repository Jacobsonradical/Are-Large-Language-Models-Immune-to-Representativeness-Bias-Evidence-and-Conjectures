{probability: 0.89, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8), which gives an estimated probability of 0.12. However, since the witness can also misidentify shorter people as taller, we need to account for this error. The error rate is 0.2 for shorter people. So, out of the 0.85 of the population that is shorter, 0.17 (0.85 * 0.2) might be misidentified as taller. Adding this to the 0.12 gives an estimated probability of 0.29. However, this is not the final answer because the witness only identified the attacker as being taller. Therefore, we need to divide this 0.29 by the total probability of the witness identifying a person as taller, which is the sum of the witness correctly identifying a taller person (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12) and incorrectly identifying a shorter person (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17). So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.89.}
