{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of 185 cm or taller people in the population (0.15) with the witness's accuracy rate in identifying tall people (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%, and since the witness identified the attacker as being tall, this is our estimated probability.}
