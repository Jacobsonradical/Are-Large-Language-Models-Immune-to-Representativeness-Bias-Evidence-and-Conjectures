{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given the 80% accuracy of the witness and the 15% probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall person) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64.}
