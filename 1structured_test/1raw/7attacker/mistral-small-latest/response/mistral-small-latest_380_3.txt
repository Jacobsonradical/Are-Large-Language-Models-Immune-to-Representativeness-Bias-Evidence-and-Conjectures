{probability: 0.68, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying tall people (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a short person as tall. This would be the proportion of short people in the population (0.85) multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying short people as tall (0.2). So, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 12% + 17% = 29%. However, this is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as tall, not the probability that the attacker actually is tall. To find the actual probability, we need to divide the 29% by the witness's overall accuracy, which is 80%. So, 29% / 80% = 0.3625, or approximately 0.68.}
