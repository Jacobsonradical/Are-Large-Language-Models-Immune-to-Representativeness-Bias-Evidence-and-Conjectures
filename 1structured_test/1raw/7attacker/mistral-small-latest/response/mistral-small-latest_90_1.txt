{probability: 0.56, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We want to know the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W). According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W). We know from the problem that P(W|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is shorter), and P(W) = 0.225 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time). So, P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.225 = 0.56}
