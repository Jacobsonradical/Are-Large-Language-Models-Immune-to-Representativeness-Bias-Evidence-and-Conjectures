{probability: 0.66, explanation: Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, there is a 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed in the 15% taller population. However, there is also a chance that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, there is a 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Adding these two probabilities together, we get a 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the witness's statement. However, since the witness can be wrong, we need to adjust this probability. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), and P(B) = 0.29 (calculated above). Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.66.}
