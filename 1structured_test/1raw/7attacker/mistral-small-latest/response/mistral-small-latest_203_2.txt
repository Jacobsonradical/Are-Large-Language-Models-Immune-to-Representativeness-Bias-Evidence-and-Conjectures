{probability: 0.68, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's 80% accuracy and the fact that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.15 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.68.}
