{probability: 0.78, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (as per information b). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (as per information a). The probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (false positive rate as per information a). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.78.}
