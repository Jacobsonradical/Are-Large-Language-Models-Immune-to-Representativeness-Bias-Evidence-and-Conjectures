{probability: 0.6, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying height (0.8), resulting in an estimated probability of 0.12. However, the witness's errors can also lead to a false positive identification of a shorter person as taller. Since half of the population is shorter, the witness could mistakenly identify a shorter person in 0.10 of cases (0.5 * 0.2). Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.6 or 60% that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
