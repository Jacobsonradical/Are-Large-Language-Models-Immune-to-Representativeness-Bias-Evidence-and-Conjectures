To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can say that P(H) = 0.15, where H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time in similar conditions, we can say that P(E|H) = 0.8, where E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time in similar conditions, we can say that P(E|not H) = 0.2.

We also need to know the probability of not H, which is the complement of H, so P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)].

Substituting the values, we get P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85].

Calculating this, we get P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.409.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.409}.
