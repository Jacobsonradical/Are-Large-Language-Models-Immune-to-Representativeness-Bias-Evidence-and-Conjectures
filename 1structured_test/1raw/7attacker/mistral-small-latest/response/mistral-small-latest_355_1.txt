{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness, who is correct 80% of the time when identifying height, then identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there is also a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually shorter. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. The total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is therefore the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness making an error in the opposite direction, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
