{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors, and given that half of the population is 185 cm or taller in the sample, the witness will make an error in identifying a shorter person as taller 10% of the time (0.5 * 0.2). So, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.56.}
