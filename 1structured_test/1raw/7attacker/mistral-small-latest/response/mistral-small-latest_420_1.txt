{probability: 0.769, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller can be calculated. Since the witness is prone to errors, we need to account for the possibility that a shorter person was misidentified as taller. The probability of this happening is 20% of the 85% shorter population, which is 0.17 (or 17%). So, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is the sum of the witness's correct identification (80% of 15% taller population, which is 0.12) and the subtraction of the misidentification error (0.17), resulting in 0.769 or 76.9%.}
