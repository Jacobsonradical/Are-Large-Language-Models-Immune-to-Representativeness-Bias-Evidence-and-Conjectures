Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
E: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness correctly identified the height
P(E): the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(not E): the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
P(W|E): the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W|not E): the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information given:
P(E) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not E) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / (P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E))

Since P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, we can calculate:

P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

The final answer is: {probability: 0.409, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.409}
