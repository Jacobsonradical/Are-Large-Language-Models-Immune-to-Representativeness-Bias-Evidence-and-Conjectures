{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

We can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Therefore, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.64 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.64.}
