{probability: 0.86, This is calculated by first finding the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8, according to the witness's accuracy). Then, we multiply this by the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15, according to the population statistics). So, the estimated probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the question asks for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). The probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being shorter). So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.86 or 86%.}
