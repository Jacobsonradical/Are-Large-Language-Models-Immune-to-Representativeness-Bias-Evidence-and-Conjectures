{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and this error would apply to the 85% of the population that is shorter than 185 cm. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72.}
