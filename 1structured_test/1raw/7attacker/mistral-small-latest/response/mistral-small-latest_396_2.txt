{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm but the witness misidentified him as taller. This would be 85% (the probability that the attacker is shorter) times 20% (the probability that the witness makes an error), which equals 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, this is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, not the probability that the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller. To find the actual probability, we need to divide the probability of the witness being correct by the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64 or 64%.}
