Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(E): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(W|E): Probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(W|~E): Probability of the witness making a mistake when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information a, assuming the witness makes the same error rate for both groups)
- P(~E): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)

According to Bayes' theorem: P(E|W) = [P(W|E) * P(E)] / [P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|~E) * P(~E)]

Substituting the given values: P(E|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.48

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.48}.
