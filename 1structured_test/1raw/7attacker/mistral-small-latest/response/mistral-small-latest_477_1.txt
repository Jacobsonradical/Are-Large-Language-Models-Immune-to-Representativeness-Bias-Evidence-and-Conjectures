{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate and the majority of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know that P(A) = 0.15 (from information b) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a). To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since P(not A) = 0.85 and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2, we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.72.}
