{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the actual proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller is 15%, Bayes' theorem can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness says tall). We know that P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(attacker is tall) = 0.15 (from information b), and P(witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness says tall | attacker is not tall) * P(attacker is not tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26 + 0.17 = 0.43. So, P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.43 â‰ˆ 0.68.}
