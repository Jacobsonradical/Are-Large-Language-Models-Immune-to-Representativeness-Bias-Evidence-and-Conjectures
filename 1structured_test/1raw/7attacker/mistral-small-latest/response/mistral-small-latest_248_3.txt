Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

First, we know that the probability of a randomly selected person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (or 15%).

Second, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height under similar conditions.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, can be calculated using conditional probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We can assume that the witness identifies people as 185 cm or taller with the same accuracy regardless of their actual height. So, P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter) is 0.2 (or 20%).

Let's calculate P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter) * P(attacker is shorter)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability we're interested in:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
