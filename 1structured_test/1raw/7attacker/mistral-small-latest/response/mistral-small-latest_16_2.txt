{probability: 0.64, explanation: Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given they are 185 cm or taller. We know that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15 (from information b). P(W) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height regardless of the attacker's height. It can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(W|A)P(A) and P(W|not A)P(not A), where P(not A) = 0.85 and P(W|not A) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate). After calculating P(W), we can then use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W), which is the probability we want: P(A|W) = P(W|A)P(A) / P(W).}
