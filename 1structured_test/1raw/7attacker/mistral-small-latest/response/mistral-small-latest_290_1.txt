{probability: 0.44, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), which gives us 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness correctly identified a person who was actually 185 cm or taller, even though the majority of the population is shorter. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm in the population (0.85) by the witness's error rate (0.2), which gives us 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimated probability of 0.44 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
