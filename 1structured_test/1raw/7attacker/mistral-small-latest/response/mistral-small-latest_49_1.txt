Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(E): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information b, we have P(E) = 0.15.
- P(W|E): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information a, we have P(W|E) = 0.8.
- P(W): The probability of the witness identifying any person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted average of P(W|E) and P(W|not E), where P(W|not E) = 0.2 (the error rate from information a) and P(not E) = 0.85 (from information b). So, P(W) = P(E) * P(W|E) + P(not E) * P(W|not E) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.23.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W), so the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 = 0.565, rounded to 0.57.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.57}
