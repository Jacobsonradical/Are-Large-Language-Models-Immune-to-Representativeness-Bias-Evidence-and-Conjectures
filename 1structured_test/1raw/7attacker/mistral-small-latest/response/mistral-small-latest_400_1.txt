{probability: 0.76,
Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
When the person is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies their height as 185 cm or taller in 20% of the cases. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, we can find P(A|B) by substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.76}
