{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying such individuals under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter individual as being 185 cm or taller. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness has a 20% error rate, the estimated probability of this happening is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 or 10%. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.72 or 72%.}
