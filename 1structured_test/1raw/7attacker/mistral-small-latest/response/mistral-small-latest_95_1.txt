{probability: 0.71, Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that the attacker's height is a random variable. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so is calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness says tall)

We know that:
- P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy)
- P(attacker is tall) = 0.15 (from the given population statistics)
- P(witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness says tall | attacker is short) * P(attacker is short)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the attacker is short)
  = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.71}
