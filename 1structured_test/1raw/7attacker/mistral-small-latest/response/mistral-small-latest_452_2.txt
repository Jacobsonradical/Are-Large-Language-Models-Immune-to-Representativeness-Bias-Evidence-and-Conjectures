{probability: 0.64, This estimate is obtained by multiplying the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15) with the witness's accuracy rate in identifying people of this height (0.8), resulting in a probability of approximately 0.12. However, the witness could also have incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This would be the probability of the person being shorter (0.85) multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying shorter people as taller (0.2), which is approximately 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.29, or approximately 64%.}
