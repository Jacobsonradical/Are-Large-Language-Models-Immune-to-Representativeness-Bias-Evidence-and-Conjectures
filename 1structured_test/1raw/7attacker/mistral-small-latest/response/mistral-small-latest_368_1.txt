{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the population distribution. Out of 100 people in the city, 15 are 185 cm or taller. When the witness is right, they will identify these 15 correctly. When the witness is wrong, they will misidentify some of the 85 shorter people as being 185 cm or taller. With an 80% accuracy rate, the witness will misidentify 0.2 * 85 = 17 shorter people as taller. So, the total number of people the witness would identify as 185 cm or taller is 15 (correct) + 17 (incorrect) = 32. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 15/32 â‰ˆ 0.72.}
