{probability: 0.86, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem to account for the witness's accuracy and the general population distribution. The prior probability is 0.15 (from information b), and the probability of the witness's correct identification given the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.86.}
