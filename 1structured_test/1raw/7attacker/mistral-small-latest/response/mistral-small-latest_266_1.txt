{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since we also know that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust this probability using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want to find P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know P(A) = 0.15. P(B|A) is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8. To find P(B), we need to consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17). So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
