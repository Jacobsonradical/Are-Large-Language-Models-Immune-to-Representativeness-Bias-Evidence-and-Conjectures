{probability: 0.84, this estimate is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.80), which results in 0.12. This represents the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually that tall. Given the witness's testimony, we can then estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller by dividing this value by the witness's overall accuracy rate (0.80), which gives us 0.12 / 0.80 = 0.84.}
