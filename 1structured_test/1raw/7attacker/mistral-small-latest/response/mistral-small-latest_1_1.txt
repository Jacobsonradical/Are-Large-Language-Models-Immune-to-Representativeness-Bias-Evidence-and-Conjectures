{probability: 0.61, explanation: Given that the witness's accuracy is 80% and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness's accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city's population) = 0.12. However, this calculation doesn't take into account the base rate fallacy. Given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to revise our estimate using Bayes' theorem. Let P(A) represent the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, and P(W|A) represent the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as such, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then, P(A|W) = P(W|A)*P(A) / P(W), where P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying any person as being 185 cm or taller. P(W) = P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|not A)*P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23. Therefore, P(A|W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.61.}
