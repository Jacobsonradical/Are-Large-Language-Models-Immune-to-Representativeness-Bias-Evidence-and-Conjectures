Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%, given the population distribution.

The witness's accuracy in identifying the height is 80%, and they identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = [P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness says so)

We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).

P(Witness says so) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a tall person and incorrectly identifying a short person as tall:

P(Witness says so) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given that the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, P(Witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

So, P(Witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.34 or 34%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.34}
