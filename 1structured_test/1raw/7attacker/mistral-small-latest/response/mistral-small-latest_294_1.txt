{probability: 0.44, This calculation is based on Bayes' theorem, where the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) times the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15), divided by the sum of the witness's accuracy times the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness's error rate times the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.2 * 0.85).}
