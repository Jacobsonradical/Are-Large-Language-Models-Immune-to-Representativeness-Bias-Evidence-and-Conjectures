{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so we need to add this probability as well: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72.}
