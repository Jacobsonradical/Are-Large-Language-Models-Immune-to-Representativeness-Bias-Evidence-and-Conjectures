Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.76.

Here's the reasoning:
1. We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time in similar conditions.
3. To find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we multiply the proportion of the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy (0.8).
4. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12% if expressed as a percentage. However, since you asked for a number between 0 and 1, the answer is 0.12.

Apologies for the initial mistake in my previous response. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
