Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know P(A) = 0.15 (from information a) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (from information b).

We also know from information b that when the witness is presented with a sample of people half of whom are 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. This means that P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Given that half of the sample are 185 cm or taller, P(not A) = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.5]
       = 0.64

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.64}.
