{probability: 0.936, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness makes errors in 20% of cases, the probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but was incorrectly identified as taller is 0.15 (15% of the population) x 0.2 (error rate) = 0.03. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.03 = 0.936.}
