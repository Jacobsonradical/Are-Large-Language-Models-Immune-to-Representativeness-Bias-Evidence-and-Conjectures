{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. However, only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. But the witness could also have made an error, and the attacker might still be taller than 185 cm. The probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being taller is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 15%. However, we also need to account for the fact that the attacker cannot be shorter than 185 cm (since the witness didn't identify them as such). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.15 / (1 - 0.85) = 0.72 or 72%.}
