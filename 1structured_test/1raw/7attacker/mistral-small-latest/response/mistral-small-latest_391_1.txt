{probability: 0.62, Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the probability of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The calculation is as follows: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. So, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.62.}
