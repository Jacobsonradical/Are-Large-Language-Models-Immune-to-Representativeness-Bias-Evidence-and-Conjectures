{probability: 0.64, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from information b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a) is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64.}
