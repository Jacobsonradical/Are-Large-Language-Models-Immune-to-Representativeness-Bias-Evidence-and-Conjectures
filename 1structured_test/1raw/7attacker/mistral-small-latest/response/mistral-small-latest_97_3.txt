{probability: 0.65, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.65.}
