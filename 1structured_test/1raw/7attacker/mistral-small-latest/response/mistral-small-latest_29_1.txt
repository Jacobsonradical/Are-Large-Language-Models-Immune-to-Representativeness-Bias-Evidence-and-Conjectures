{probability: 0.64, explanation: The attacker being 185 cm or taller is a conditional probability, which depends on both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (information a), and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time (information b), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we must also account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identified them as taller. Since half the population is 185 cm or taller in the witness's test sample, the witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as taller 10% of the time (0.5 * 0.2). Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.48 * 0.10 (incorrect identification) = 0.12 + 0.048 = 0.64.}
