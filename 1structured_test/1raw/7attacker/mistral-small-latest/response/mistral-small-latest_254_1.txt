{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness is 80% accurate and the overall population has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.56.}
