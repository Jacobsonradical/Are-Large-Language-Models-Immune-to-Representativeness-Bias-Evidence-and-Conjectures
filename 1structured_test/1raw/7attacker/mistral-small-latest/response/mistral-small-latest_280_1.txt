{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies the height, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there's also a 20% chance that the witness misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this error would result in a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.56.}
