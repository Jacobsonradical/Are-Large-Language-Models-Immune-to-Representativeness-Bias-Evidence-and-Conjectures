{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies height, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (probability of correct identification) times 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city), which equals 0.64 or 64%.}
