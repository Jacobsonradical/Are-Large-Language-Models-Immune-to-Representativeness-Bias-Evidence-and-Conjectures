{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, there is a 0.15 base rate for the attacker's height. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying such heights. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the probability of the witness being correct given the attacker's height. We need the reverse probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want P(A|W). According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W). Here, P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (base rate), and P(W) = P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|not A)*P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23. So, P(A|W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.76. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.76.}
