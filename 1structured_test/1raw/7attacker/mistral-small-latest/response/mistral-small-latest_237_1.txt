{probability: 0.52, The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller in 80% of the cases when the person was actually that tall. However, only 15% of the population fits this description. Therefore, the probability is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. Given that the attacker was identified as such by the witness, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability. The prior probability was 0.15, and the likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.80. So, the posterior probability is (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.52.}
