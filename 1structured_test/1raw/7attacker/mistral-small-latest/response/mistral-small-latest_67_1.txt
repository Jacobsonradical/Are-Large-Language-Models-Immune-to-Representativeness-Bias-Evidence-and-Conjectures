{probability: 0.64, This estimate is derived by first calculating the likelihood that the witness would correctly identify the attacker given their height (0.8 for taller individuals), and then multiplying that by the base rate of taller individuals in the population (0.15). The result is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. Since the witness identified the attacker as taller, we can consider this as the probability that the attacker is actually taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.04) = 0.64, where 0.04 is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller.}
