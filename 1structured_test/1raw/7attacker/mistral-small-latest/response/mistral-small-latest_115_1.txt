{probability: 0.48, Explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. However, since only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust this probability. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. But we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness identified him as taller. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.85 (the proportion of the population shorter than 185 cm). So, the total estimated probability is 0.12 (witness correct) + 0.17 (witness error) = 0.48.}
