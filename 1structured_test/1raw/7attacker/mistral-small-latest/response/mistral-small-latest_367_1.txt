{probability: 0.51, Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.51. This accounts for the possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness misidentified their height.}
