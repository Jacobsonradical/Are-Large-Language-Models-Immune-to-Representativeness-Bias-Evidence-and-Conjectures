Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

First, let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

From the information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter. The witness could identify the attacker's height correctly in these cases with probabilities P(B|A) and P(B|not A), respectively.

We don't have the value for P(B|not A), but we can calculate it using the total probability law: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since P(not A) = 0.85 and we know P(B|A) = 0.8, we can solve for P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = (P(B) - P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(not A) = (P(B) - 0.15 * 0.8) / 0.85

We also know that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get P(B) = 0.24.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.5

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

Final answer: {probability: 0.5}
