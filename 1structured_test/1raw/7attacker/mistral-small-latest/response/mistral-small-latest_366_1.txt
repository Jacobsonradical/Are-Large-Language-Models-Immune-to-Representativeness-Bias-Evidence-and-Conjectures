{probability: 0.56,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, and P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(W|A) = 0.8.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W), where P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as 185 cm or taller.

To find P(W), we need to consider both the cases where the witness is correct and where the witness is wrong.

Let's denote P(~A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(~A) = 0.85. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is P(W|~A) = 0.2 (from the 20% error rate).

So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28.

Therefore, P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.56. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.56.
