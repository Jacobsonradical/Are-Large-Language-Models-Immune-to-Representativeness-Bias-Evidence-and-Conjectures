Based on the information provided, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when half of the sample were 185 cm or taller. Given that the actual proportion of the population in the city that is 185 cm or taller is 15%, we can adjust for this difference.

If the witness is equally likely to make mistakes for people who are shorter and taller than 185 cm, then the witness's mistakes would be more likely to involve people who are actually shorter (since there are more of them). Therefore, we would expect the witness's correct identifications of people who are 185 cm or taller to be higher than their overall accuracy of 80%.

However, without more specific information about the pattern of the witness's mistakes, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate. A rough estimate might be that the witness is correct about people who are 185 cm or taller more often than they are overall, perhaps around 90%.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is: {probability: 0.9}
