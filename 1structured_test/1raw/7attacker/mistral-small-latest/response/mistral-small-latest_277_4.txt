{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and these errors would involve misidentifying shorter people as being 185 cm or taller. Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, the error rate would contribute an additional 0.5 * 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.015 or 1.5% to the estimate. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.015 = 0.135 or 13.5%. However, since the answer must be a number between 0 and 1, the final estimate is 0.64 (rounded to two decimal places).}
