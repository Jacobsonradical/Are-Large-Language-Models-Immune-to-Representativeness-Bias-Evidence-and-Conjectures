{probability: 0.69, The witness correctly identified the height of people who are 185 cm or taller in 80% of cases. Given that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the witness's 20% error rate in identifying shorter people as taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as approximately 0.69 or 69%.}
