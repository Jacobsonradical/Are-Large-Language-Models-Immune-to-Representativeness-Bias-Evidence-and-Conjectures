{probability: 0.72, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation (a) given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.72.}
