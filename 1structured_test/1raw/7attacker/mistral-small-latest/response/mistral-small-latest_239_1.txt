{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, there's an initial 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. So, out of the 15% who are 185 cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify 15% * 80% = 12%. But we also need to account for the instances where the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This is 85% * 20% = 17%. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 12% + 17% = 29%. However, this 29% represents the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, not the actual probability that the attacker is that height. To find the actual probability, we divide the 29% by the witness's overall error rate, which is 20% of the total population (20% of 100% = 20%). So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 29% / 20% = 0.58 or 58%.}
