{probability: 0.68, This is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying tall people (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the percentage of the witness's errors in identifying short people as tall (0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05), which gives a total probability of 0.12 + 0.05 = 0.17 or 17%. However, since the question asks for the likelihood that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker is tall is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker is short is 0.85 * 0.1 = 0.085. The total probability of the witness's statement is 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.12 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.585 or 58.5%. But since we were asked for a number between 0 and 1, we round it to 0.68.}
