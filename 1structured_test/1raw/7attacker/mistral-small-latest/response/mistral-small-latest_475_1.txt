{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, we need to consider two probabilities: the witness being correct and the attacker actually being that tall. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height is 0.8 (80% success rate). So, the probability that both events happened (the attacker is tall and the witness is correct) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness could also be correct when identifying a tall attacker even though tall people are less common in the population. This is known as the positive predictive value. Using Bayes' theorem, the positive predictive value is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64 or 64%. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.64.}
