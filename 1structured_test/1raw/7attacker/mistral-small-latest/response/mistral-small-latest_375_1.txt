{probability: 0.76,

Explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

0.85 (probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height) = 0.76 or 76%.}
