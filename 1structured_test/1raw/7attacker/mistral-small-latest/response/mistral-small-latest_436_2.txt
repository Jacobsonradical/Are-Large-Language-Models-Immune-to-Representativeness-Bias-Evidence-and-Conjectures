{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) multiplied by 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller), which equals 0.72 or 72%.}
