{probability: 0.52, Explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying a person's height, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: The witness is 80% accurate when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (true positive rate), and 20% inaccurate when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (false positive rate). However, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a higher chance that a randomly selected person is shorter. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote T as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. P(T) = 0.15 (from information b), P(W|T) = 0.8 (from information a), P(W|not T) = 0.2 (from information a). P(not T) = 0.85. Then P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.52.}
