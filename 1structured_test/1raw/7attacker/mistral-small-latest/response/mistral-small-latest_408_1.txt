{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.64.}
