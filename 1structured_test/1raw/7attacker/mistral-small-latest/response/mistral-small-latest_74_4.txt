{probability: 0.52, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. If we were to randomly select someone from the population, the probability they are 185 cm or taller is 0.15. However, given the witness's accuracy, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.52.}
