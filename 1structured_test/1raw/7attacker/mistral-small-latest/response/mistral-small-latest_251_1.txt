{probability: 0.91, explanation: Given the information, we can calculate the probability as follows:
1. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).
2. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height under similar conditions.
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that tall, is 0.8.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's statement) = [P(witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness's statement)
5. P(witness's statement) = [P(witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(witness's statement | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
6. P(witness's statement | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2. So, the equation becomes: P(witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
7. Plugging in the values, we get: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.91}
