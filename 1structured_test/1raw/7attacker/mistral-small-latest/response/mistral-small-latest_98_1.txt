  probability: 0.68,
  explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be estimated by considering both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. First, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Then, since the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, we multiply the 15% by 0.8 to get an estimated probability of 0.12. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies shorter people as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. So, we need to account for the probability of this error in our estimation. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we multiply this by the 20% error rate to get an estimated probability of 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is approximately 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68.
