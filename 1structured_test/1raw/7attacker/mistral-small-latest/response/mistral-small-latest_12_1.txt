{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct in identifying height, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness's accuracy) * 0.15 (percentage of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. However, since the witness has a 20% error rate, there is also a chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This would be 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.85 (percentage of people in the city who are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.17. To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we subtract the probability of the witness's error from 1: 1 - 0.17 = 0.64 or 64%.}
