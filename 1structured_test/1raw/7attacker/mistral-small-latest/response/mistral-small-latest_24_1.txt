Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A and the event of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as B. We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
Assuming the witness's error rate is the same for people shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.

Answer: {probability: 0.545}
