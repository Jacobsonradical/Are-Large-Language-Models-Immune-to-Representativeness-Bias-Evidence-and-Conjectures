{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as this tall, we need to consider the probability of this happening given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is known as the positive predictive value (PPV). PPV = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives) = 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64 or 64%.}
