{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate when identifying taller individuals (0.8), resulting in a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller in 10% of cases (0.5 * 0.2), we need to add this to our previous estimate. So, the final probability is 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22 or 22%. But since the question asks for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, and not the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller in the general population, we need to adjust our answer using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want P(A|B), which is equal to P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct when the attacker is tall and the witness being incorrect when the attacker is not tall: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21. Therefore, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.68.}
