{probability: 0.70, The attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness. Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% and the fact that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller to be around 0.70 (80% of 15%).}
