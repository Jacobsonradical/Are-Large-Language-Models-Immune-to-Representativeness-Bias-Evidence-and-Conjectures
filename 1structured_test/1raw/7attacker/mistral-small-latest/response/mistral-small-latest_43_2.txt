{probability: 0.77, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood (a) of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that he actually is, is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.77.}
