Given the information provided:

{probability: 0.76,
Explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. We know that the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15. The witness is correct 80% of the time when someone is 185 cm or taller, so the likelihood of the witness being correct given that the attacker is tall is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is tall given that the witness said so is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.76.}
