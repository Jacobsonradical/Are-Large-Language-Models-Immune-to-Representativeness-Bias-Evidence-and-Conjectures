{probability: 0.56, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the population statistics (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. Then, considering the possibility of the witness making a false positive identification (mistaking a shorter person for a taller one), we multiply the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85) by the probability of the witness making a mistake (0.2). So, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities gives us a total probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, this is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, we use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. So, 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.56 or 56%.}
