Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:

- T: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬T) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

By Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|¬T) * P(¬T)]

Since P(¬T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85, we can calculate P(T|W) as follows:

P(T|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.4

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4}
