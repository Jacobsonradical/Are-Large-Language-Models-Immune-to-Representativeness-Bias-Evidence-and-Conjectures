{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness is correct in this instance. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we multiply these two probabilities together to get an estimated probability of 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the estimated probability that the attacker is taller given that the witness said he is taller. To get the probability that the attacker is taller, we need to account for the possibility that the witness is incorrect. Since there is a 20% chance that the witness is incorrect, there is a 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% chance that the attacker is shorter but the witness said he is taller. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64 or 64%.}
