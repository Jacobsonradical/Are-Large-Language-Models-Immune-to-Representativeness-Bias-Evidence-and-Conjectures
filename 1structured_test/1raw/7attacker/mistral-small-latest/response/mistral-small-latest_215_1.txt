{probability: 0.68, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being in the taller group (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone in that group (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, since the witness could have also correctly identified someone from the shorter group as being taller (a false positive), we add this probability, which is 0.5 (half the population) times 0.2 (the probability of the witness making an error), which equals 0.1. Therefore, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.68.}
