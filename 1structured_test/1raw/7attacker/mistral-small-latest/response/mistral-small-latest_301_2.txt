{probability: 0.62, This is calculated as follows: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when half the sample was 185 cm or taller. However, in the population, only 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, if we adjust for the population distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (proportion of population 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. But this is the probability given that the witness was presented with a person who is 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, the total probability of the witness identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.62.}
