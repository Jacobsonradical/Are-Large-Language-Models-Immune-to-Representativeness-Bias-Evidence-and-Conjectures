{probability: 0.6, Based on Bayes' theorem, the prior probability (from information b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, so the likelihood is 0.8 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.6.}
