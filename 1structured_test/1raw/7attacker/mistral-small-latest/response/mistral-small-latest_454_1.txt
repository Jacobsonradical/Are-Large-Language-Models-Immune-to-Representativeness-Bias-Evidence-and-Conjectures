{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and the error rate is 20%, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * (15/100) / (0.8 * (15/100) + 0.2 * (85/100)) = 0.64. This calculation uses Bayes' theorem to account for the witness's accuracy and the general population height distribution.}
