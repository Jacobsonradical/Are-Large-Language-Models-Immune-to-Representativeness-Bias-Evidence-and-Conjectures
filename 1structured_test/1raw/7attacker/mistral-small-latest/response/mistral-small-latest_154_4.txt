{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as follows: 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.80 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Given that half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness has a 20% error rate, the probability of this happening is: 0.50 (probability of attacker being shorter) * 0.20 (witness's error rate) = 0.10. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, according to the witness's statement and their accuracy rate, is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.10 (incorrect identification) = 0.64.}
