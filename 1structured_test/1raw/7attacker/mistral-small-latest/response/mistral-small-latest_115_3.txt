{probability: 0.704, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have misidentified a shorter person as tall. Since 85% of the population is shorter, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.704 or 70.4%.}
