{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height and the fact that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed this tall. If the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter, the probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. However, the witness did identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually this tall is 1 - 0.17 = 0.64 or 64%.}
