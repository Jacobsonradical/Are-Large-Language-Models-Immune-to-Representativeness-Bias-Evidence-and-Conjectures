{probability: 0.62, The witness has a 20% error rate in identifying heights. Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller is 15%, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability. The posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.62.}
