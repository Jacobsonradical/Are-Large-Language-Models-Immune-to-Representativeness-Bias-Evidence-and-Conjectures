Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information b, the prior probability P(A) is 0.15.

From the information a, the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W|A), is 0.8.

The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, P(W|not A), is 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find the posterior probability P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

So, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.571

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.571.

Answer: {probability: 0.571}
