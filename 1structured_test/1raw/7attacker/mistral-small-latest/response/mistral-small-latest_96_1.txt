Based on the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

1. According to the witness's accuracy rate, when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies their height 80% of the time.
2. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (given by information "a").
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller AND the witness correctly identified their height is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:

{probability: 0.12}
