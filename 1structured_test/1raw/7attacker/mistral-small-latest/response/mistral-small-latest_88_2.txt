{probability: 0.64,

Explanation:
1. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population demographics, is 0.15.
2. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.
3. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. However, the witness could also have incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller.
5. The probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.5 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm) * 0.2 (probability of the witness making an error) = 0.10.
6. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and making an error in favor of a taller person: 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.64.}
