Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.64.

Answer: {probability: 0.64}
