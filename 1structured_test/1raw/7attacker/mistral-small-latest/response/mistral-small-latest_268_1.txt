{probability: 0.94, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given he is 185 cm or taller (0.8), which results in 0.12. Then, we consider the possibility that the witness made an error but the attacker is still 185 cm or taller. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness making an error (0.2), which results in 0.03. Adding these two probabilities gives the final estimate of 0.94 or 94%.}
