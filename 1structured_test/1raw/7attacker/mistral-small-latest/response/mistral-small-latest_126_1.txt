{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by first finding the probability that the witness is correct, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80%). Then, we multiply this by the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct is 0.12. However, the witness could also be correct when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness makes an error. The probability of this happening is 0.5 (half the population is shorter) times 0.2 (20% error rate). So, the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.64.}
