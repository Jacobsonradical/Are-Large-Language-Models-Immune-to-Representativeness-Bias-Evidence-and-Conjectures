{probability: 0.96, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.96 or 96%.}
