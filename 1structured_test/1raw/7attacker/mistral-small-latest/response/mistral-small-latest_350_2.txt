Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.4545

So, your estimate is {probability: 0.4545}
