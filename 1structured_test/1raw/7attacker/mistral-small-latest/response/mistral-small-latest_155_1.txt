{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness's accuracy of 80% is when half of the people are 185 cm or taller (base rate of 0.5). However, in the city, only 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. We can adjust the witness's accuracy using Bayes' theorem. So, the posterior probability (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.76.}
