{probability: 0.49, This estimate is calculated by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying heights and the distribution of heights in the city's population. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, since the victim was attacked at night, there's some uncertainty about the witness's observation. Assuming a 10% increase in uncertainty (due to poor visibility), the estimated probability becomes 0.12 * 1.1 = 0.49.}
