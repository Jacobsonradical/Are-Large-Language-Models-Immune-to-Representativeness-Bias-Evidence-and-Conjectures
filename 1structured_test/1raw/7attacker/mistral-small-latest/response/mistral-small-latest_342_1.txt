{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct in identifying a person's height and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (percentage of tall people) = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness identified the attacker as being tall, so we need to adjust for this observation. Using Bayes' theorem, P(Tall|Observed Tall) = [P(Observed Tall|Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Observed Tall). Here, P(Observed Tall|Tall) = 0.8 (witness accuracy), P(Tall) = 0.15, and P(Observed Tall) = P(Observed Tall|Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Observed Tall|Not Tall) * P(Not Tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.252. So, P(Tall|Observed Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.252 â‰ˆ 0.64 or 64%.}
