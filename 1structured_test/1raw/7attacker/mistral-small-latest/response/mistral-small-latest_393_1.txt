Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.

Therefore, {probability: 0.36}
