{probability: 0.78, This is based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability, which is our estimate, is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.78.}
