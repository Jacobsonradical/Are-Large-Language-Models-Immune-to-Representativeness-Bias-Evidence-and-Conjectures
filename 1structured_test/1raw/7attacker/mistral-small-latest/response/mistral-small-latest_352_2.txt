{probability: 0.58, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being that tall in the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.80), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as tall (0.10, which is half the population of shorter people multiplied by the witness's error rate of 0.20). So, 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.58}
