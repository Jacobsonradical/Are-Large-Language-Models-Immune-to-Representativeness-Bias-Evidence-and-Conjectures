{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information a). The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time (from information b), so the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is tall is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64.}
