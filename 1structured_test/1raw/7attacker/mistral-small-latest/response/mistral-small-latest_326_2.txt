{probability: 0.875, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability (our estimate) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so the likelihood of observing that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 0.2. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of observing the witness's report given that the attacker is shorter is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Using Bayes' theorem, our final estimate is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.875.}
