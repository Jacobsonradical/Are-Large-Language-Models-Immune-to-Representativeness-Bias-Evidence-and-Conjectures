{probability: 0.83, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Given that the witness could also misidentify a shorter person as taller (false positive), we need to account for this error rate. The error rate for shorter people is 20% of half the population (since half the sample is shorter), which is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total probability that the witness identified a shorter person as taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22. The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is then 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.22) = 0.83.}
