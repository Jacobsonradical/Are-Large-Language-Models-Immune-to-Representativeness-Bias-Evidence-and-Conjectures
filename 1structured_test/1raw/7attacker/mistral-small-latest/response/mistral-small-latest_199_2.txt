{probability: 0.68, This is calculated by assuming the witness is correct in their identification. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability would be 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, this is the probability that the attacker is taller given that the witness is correct. Since we don't know if the witness is correct or not in this case, we need to account for the possibility of error. The probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.2. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.68.}
