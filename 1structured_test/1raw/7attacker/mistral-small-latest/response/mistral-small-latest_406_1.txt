{probability: 0.72, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness made an identification, we can assume the attacker was indeed in the taller group. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, is 0.12 / 0.15 = 0.72 or 72%.}
