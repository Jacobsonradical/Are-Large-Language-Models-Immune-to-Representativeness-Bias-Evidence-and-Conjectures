{probability: 0.86, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is estimated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being in the 15% of the population who are 185 cm or taller (0.15) with the probability that the witness is correct when identifying someone in this height group (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given that half the population is shorter than 185 cm, this would be 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.86.}
