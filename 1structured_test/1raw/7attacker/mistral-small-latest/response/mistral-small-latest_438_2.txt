{probability: 0.92, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is 80% accurate, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that the witness is correct. Using Bayes' theorem, P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = [P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall)] / P(witness says tall). P(witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness says tall | attacker is not tall) * P(attacker is not tall). Here, P(attacker is not tall) is 0.85, P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) is 0.8, and P(witness says tall | attacker is not tall) is the error rate of 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Substituting these values, we get P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) â‰ˆ 0.92 or 92%.}
