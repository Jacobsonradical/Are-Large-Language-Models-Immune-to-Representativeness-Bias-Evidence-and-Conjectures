{probability: 0.58, Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58 (rounded from 0.5833). This is calculated by multiplying the accuracy of the witness (0.8) by the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15).}
