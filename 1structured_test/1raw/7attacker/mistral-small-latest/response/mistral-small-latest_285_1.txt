{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of misidentifying a shorter person as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (misidentification of shorter people) = 0.64.}
