{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the product of the probability that the attacker is in that height range in the population (0.15) and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8). Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%, when rounded to a whole number. However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness said so) = [P(witness said so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness said so). We know P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, P(witness said so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, and P(witness said so) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(witness said so) = P(witness said so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness said so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness said so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
