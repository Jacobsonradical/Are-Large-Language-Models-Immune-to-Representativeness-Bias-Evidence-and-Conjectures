{probability: 0.72, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate for identifying such individuals (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%, which is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller than 185 cm. So, we need to account for this error rate in the larger population of shorter individuals (0.85). Therefore, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29% that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, since the question asks for the estimate of this probability, and the witness was able to identify the attacker's height, we can adjust our estimate to reflect the witness's statement. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 / 0.29 + 0.71 (probability that the witness would correctly identify a shorter person) = 0.72.}
