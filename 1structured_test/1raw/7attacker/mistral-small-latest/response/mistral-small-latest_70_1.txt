{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying people of this height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, which is approximately 0.64 when considering the witness's potential error in identifying shorter people.}
