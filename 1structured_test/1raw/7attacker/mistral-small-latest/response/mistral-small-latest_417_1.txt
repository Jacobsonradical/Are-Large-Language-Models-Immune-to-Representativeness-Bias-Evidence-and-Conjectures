{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate for identifying heights in similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness did identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability of this identification being correct given that it was made. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. P(B|A) is the witness's accuracy rate of 0.8, P(A) is 0.15, and P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a tall person and incorrectly identifying a short person as tall: 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.23. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15/0.23 â‰ˆ 0.72.}
