{probability: 0.84, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.84. This is calculated as follows: 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city).}
