{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, since the witness also makes errors 20% of the time when identifying shorter people as taller, there is a chance that the attacker was actually shorter but misidentified. The probability of this is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
