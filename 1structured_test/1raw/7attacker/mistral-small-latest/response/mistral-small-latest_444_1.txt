{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy of 80% and the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller at 15%, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.64 or 64%.}
