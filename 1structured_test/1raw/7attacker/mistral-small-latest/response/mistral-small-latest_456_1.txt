{probability: 0.56, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We want to find the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as such. Let's use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's population data), and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56.}
