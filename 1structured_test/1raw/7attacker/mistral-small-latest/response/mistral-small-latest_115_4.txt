{probability: 0.72, based on the given information, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying the height (0.8). Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.72 or 72%.}
