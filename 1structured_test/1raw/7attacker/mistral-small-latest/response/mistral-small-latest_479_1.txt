{probability: 0.88, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is 80% accurate in identifying height under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. However, there's also a chance that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter, and the witness has a 20% error rate, the probability of this mistake is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. But this includes the possibility of a false positive. To find the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to divide by the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as such (both true positives and false positives), which is 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.31. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.88.}
