{probability: 0.72, The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 72%.}

Explanation:
First, we know that there's a 15% chance that any random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, there's an 80% * 15% = 12% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error, but the attacker was still tall. The witness made errors 20% of the time, and given that half of the population is 185 cm or taller in our sample, there's a 20% * 50% = 10% chance that the witness incorrectly identified a tall person as short.

Adding these probabilities together, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 12% + 10% = 0.72 or 72%.
