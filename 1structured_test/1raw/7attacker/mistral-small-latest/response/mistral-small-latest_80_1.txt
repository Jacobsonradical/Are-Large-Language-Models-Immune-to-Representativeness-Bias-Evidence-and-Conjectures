{probability: 0.87, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Given that 85% of the population is shorter and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the estimated probability for this scenario is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 that the witness identified the attacker's height correctly. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, our final estimate is 0.29.}
