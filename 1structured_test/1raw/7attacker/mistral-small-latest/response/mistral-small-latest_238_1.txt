{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (information a), the prior probability of the attacker being that height is 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time (information b), so the likelihood of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability (using Bayes' theorem) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this does not account for the witness's error rate. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) * 0.5 (the probability that the attacker is shorter, since half the population is shorter). So, the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, according to the witness's testimony and error rate, is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.64 or 64%.}
