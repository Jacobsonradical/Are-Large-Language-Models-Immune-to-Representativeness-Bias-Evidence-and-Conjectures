{probability: 0.73, based on Bayes' theorem}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
2. We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
3. We also know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller).
4. We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
6. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
7. We know P(not A) = 0.85, and P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.
8. So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21
9. Finally, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.73

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.73.
