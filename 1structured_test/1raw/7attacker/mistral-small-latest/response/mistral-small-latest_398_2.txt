{probability: 0.704, This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city population (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also has a chance of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Since half the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness has a 10% chance of making this error (0.5 * 0.2). Adding the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a tall person and incorrectly identifying a short person gives a total estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.704 or 70.4%.}
