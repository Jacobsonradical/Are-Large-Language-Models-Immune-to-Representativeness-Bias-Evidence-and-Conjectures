{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: The problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental formula in statistics for calculating conditional probabilities.

Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and W be the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W).

From the given information, P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller), P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller), and P(W) needs to be calculated.

P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A). Since 80% of the time the witness is correct when the person is 185 cm or taller, then 20% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller. So, P(W|not A) = 0.2. And P(not A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A)).

Substituting these values, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22.

Finally, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.64.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.64.
