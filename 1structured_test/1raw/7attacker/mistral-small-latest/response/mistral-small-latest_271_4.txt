{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 15% * 80% = 0.12 * 0.8 = 0.096 or 9.6%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter but the witness made a mistake. The witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, and there is an 85% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.096 (correct identification) + 0.17 (mistaken identification) = 0.64 or 64%.}
