{probability: 0.54, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. Given the witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying height under similar conditions, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can now update our probability estimate. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is (0.12 / (0.12 + 0.15*0.2)) = 0.54.}
