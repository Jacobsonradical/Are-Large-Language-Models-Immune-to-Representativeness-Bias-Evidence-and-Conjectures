{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identified them as taller. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.76.}
