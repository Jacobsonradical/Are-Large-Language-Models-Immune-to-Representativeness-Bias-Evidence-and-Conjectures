{probability: 0.48, This estimate is calculated by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the population distribution. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness has a 20% error rate, the probability that the attacker was actually shorter but identified as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.48.}
