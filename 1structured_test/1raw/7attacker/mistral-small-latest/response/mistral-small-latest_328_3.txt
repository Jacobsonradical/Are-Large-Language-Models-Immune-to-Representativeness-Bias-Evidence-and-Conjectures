{probability: 0.72, explanation: The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy, and assuming that the witness's errors are evenly distributed among tall and short people, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 80% * (15% / 50%) = 0.72.}
