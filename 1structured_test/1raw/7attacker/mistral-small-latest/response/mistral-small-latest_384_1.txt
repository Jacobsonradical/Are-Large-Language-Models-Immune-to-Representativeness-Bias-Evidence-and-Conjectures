{probability: 0.7875, The attacker was identified by a witness who has an 80% accuracy rate in determining heights. Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, we can adjust this probability based on the witness's error rate. The witness would misidentify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller in 20% of cases, but since only 15% of the population is this tall, the probability of this error is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 - 0.03 = 0.78 or 78.75%.}
