{probability: 0.92, explanation: Given that the attacker was identified by the witness as 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let T be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want to find P(T|W), the probability of T given W. Bayes' theorem states that P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W). We know from the problem that P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population), P(W|T) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller), and P(W|not T) = 0.2 (witness makes a mistake 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm). We also know that P(not T) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22. Finally, we can find P(T|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.92.}
