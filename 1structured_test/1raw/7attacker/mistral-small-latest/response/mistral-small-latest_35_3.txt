Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakes shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Calculating the values:
P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4286}
