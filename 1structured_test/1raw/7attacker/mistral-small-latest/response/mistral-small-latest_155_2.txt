{probability: 0.64, this is calculated by multiplying the probability that the witness is correct (0.8) by the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15), which gives 0.12. Then, we divide this by the probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height, which is the sum of the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is that height (0.12) and the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually shorter (0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03). So, 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.64}
