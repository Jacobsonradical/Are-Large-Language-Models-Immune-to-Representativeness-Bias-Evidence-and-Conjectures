{probability: 0.75, This is based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that he is 185 cm or taller, is 0.80 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.75.}
