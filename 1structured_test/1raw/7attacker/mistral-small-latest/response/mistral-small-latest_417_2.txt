{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and these errors would be in identifying shorter people as taller (since the witness never mistakenly identifies tall people as short). Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29% that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for this information. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is (0.29 * 0.8) / (0.29 * 0.8 + 0.71 * 0.2) â‰ˆ 0.64.}
