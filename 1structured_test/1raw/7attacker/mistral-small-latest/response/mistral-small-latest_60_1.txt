{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors in 20% of the cases, so there's a chance that the attacker might be shorter but mistakenly identified as taller. Since the witness identified the attacker as taller, and there's a 50% chance that a random person from the sample is shorter, the probability of this error is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.64.}
