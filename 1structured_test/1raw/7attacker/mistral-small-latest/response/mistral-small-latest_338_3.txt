{probability: 0.64,

This is a Bayesian inference problem. Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we have:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying tall people)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying short people)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.64.}
