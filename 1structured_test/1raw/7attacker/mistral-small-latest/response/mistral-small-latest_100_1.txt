{probability: 0.66, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, given by information b. The likelihood of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8, given by information a. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is therefore approximately 0.66.}
