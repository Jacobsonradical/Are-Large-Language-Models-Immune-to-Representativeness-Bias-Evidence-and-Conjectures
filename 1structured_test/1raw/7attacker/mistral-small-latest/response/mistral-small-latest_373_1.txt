{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker indeed is 185 cm or taller. If we assume the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the general population (15% are 185 cm or taller), then the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness's statement is also subject to false positives, where a shorter person is identified as 185 cm or taller. The probability of a false positive is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the probability of a correct identification divided by the sum of probabilities of correct identification and false positives, which is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.58.}
