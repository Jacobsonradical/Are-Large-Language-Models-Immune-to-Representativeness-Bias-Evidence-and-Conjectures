{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.9 (the probability that the witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 0.20 * 0.15 (the probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm). Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.72.}
