{probability: 0.78, this estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem to the given data. The prior probability (b) of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's observation (a) given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's observation) is approximately 0.78.}
