{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). The witness's accuracy in identifying such individuals is 0.8, and their error rate is 0.2. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.64.}
