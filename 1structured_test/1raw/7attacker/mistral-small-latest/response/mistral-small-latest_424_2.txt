{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time in similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a chance the witness misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, which is the probability that the witness identified someone as 185 cm or taller. But we are looking for the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. Assuming the witness's errors are random, we can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is (0.12 / 0.29) = approximately 0.64.}
