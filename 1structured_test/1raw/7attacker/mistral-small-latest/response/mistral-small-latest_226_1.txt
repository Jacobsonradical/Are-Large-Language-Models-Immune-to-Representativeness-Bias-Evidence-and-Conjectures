{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identified him as being taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness makes mistakes in 20% of cases, the probability of this event is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64, or 64%, that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
