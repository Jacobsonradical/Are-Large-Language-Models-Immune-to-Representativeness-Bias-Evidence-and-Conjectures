{probability: 0.63, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood (a) of the witness correctly identifying a person of 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability (the probability we're looking for) is approximately 0.63.}
