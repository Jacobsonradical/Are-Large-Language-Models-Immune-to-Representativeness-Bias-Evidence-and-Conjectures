{probability: 0.75, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker indeed is 185 cm or taller. The prior probability (from b) is 0.15, and the likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is approximately 0.75.}
