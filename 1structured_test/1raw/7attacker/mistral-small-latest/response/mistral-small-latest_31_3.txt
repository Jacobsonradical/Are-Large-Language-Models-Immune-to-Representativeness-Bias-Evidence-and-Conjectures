{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the distribution of heights in the city. The witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of the cases, but we need to adjust this for the fact that most people in the city are shorter than 185 cm. So, if the witness saw a random person from the city, they would correctly identify them as 185 cm or taller in 80% * 15% = 0.12 of the cases. However, the witness specifically identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which suggests they saw something that led them to this conclusion. Given the witness's accuracy, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller as 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.64.}
