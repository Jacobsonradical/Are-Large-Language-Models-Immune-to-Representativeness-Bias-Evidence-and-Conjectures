{probability: 0.74, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the city's population (0.15) with the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height under similar conditions (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, which is approximately 0.74 when considering the witness's error rate.}
