{probability: 0.78, This is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the probability of a randomly selected person from the city being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.78.}
