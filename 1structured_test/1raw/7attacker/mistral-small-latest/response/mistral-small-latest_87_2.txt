{probability: 0.77, explanation: Bayes' theorem can be applied here. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Given information a, P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy). From information b, P(A) = 0.15 (proportion of the population 185 cm or taller). To find P(B), we need to consider both true positives (attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness correctly identifies) and false positives (attacker is shorter but witness incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller). P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.22. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15/0.22 â‰ˆ 0.77.}
