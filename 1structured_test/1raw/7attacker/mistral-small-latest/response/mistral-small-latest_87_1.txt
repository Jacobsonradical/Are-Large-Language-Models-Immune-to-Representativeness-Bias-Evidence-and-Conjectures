{probability: 0.7875,

Here's the reasoning:

Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller as follows:

Assuming a representative sample of the population in the city, the probability that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller is 15% (based on information b).

However, we must consider the witness's error rate. In this case, the witness might incorrectly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 20% (the witness's error rate) times 85% (the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

So, the probability that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller, despite the witness's potential errors, is:

15% - (20% * 85%) = 0.15 - 0.17 = -0.02

Since a probability cannot be negative, we need to consider that our calculation included the possibility of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller. To correct this, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is actually 185 cm or taller:

80% * 15% = 0.12

Adding this to our initial calculation, we get an estimated probability of 0.15 - 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.7875 or 78.75% that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
