{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. The witness's accuracy is affected by the base rate of tall people in the population, which is 15%. So, we need to account for this. The estimated probability is 0.80 (witness's accuracy) x 0.15 (base rate of tall people) = 0.12. However, this is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the witness could also be correct when the attacker is shorter but identified as taller (a false positive), we need to account for this as well. The false positive rate is 0.20 (witness's error rate) x 0.85 (base rate of short people) = 0.17. Adding the probabilities of the witness being correct when the attacker is actually tall and when the witness makes a false positive gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64 that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
