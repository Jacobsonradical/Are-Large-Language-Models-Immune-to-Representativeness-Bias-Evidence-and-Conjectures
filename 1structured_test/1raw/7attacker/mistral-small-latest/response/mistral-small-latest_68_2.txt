{probability: 0.85, This estimate is based on the fact that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.85.}
