{probability: 0.65, The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, and given that the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for the base rate of the population. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.65.}
