{probability: 0.704, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15), and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given they were 185 cm or taller (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.704 or 70.4%.}
