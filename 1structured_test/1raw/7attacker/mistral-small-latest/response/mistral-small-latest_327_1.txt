Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

First, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.

Second, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the sample is evenly split between those shorter and taller than 185 cm. Since the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, this is the likelihood we need to consider.

To find the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Likelihood) / (Prior probability * Likelihood) + ((1 - Prior probability) * (1 - Likelihood))

Substituting the values:

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is {probability: 0.36}.
