{probability: 0.852, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the population distribution (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given they were 185 cm or taller (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identified their height. Then, adding the probability that the witness made an error when the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1) gives a total estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.852 or 85.2%.}
