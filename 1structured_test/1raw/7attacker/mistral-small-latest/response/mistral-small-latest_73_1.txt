{probability: 0.875, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, even though half of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the witness's accuracy for identifying tall people is 2 times higher than their overall accuracy (since there are twice as many shorter people in the population). So, the witness's accuracy for identifying tall people is 80% * 2 = 160%. However, since this is greater than 100%, we can assume that the witness is particularly good at identifying tall people and has close to 100% accuracy in this case. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was this height or taller is approximately 15% * 100% = 0.875 or 87.5%.}
