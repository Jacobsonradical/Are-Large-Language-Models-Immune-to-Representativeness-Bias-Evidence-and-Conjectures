{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Combining these two probabilities, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64, which is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
