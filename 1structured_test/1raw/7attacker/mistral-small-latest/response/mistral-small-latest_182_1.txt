{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
