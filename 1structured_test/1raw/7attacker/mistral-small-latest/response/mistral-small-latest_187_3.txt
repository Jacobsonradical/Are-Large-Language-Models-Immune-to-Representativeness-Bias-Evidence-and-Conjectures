{probability: 0.85, Based on the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying height is independent of the actual distribution of heights in the population. Given that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, who is 80% accurate, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.85.}
