Based on the given information, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city population)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm in the city population)

Using Bayes' theorem:
- P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:
- P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545.

Answer: {probability: 0.4545}
