{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is the prior probability. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the likelihood is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability = (Likelihood * Prior probability) / (Likelihood * Prior probability + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior probability))
Posterior probability = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.64}
