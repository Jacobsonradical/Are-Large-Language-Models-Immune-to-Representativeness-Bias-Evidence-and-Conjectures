{probability: 0.68, Given the information, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be found using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.252. So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.252 â‰ˆ 0.68.}
