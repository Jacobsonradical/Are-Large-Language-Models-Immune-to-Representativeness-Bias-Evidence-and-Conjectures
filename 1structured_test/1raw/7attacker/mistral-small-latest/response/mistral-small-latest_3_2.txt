{probability: 0.54, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. Given that only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, this suggests a higher probability than 15%. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.54.}
