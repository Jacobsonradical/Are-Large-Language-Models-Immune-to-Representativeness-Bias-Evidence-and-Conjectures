{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness's identification is accurate. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we multiply these two probabilities together to get an estimated probability of 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm but was misidentified by the witness. 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker was shorter but misidentified as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, this is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so. We need to adjust this for the base rate, which is 15%. Using Bayes' theorem, we get a final estimate of (0.29 * 0.15) / (0.29 * 0.15 + 0.71 * 0.85) = 0.68 or 68%.}
