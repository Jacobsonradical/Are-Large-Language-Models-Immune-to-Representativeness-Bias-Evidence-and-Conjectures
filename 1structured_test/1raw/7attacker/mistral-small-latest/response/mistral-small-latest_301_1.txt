{probability: 0.53,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
E = the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W = the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(E|W), the probability of E given W.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

From the information:
P(E) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|E^c) * P(E^c)

P(W|E^c) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate when the person is shorter, which is the complement of the correct identification rate: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

P(E^c) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.53.
