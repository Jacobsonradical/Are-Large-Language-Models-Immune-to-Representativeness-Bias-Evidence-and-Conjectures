{probability: 0.96, this is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness (80%) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the height (given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller), which is 1 minus the error rate (20%), resulting in a probability of 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.96 or 96%}
