{probability: 0.68, Given the information provided, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 80%. However, we also need to consider the base rate of the population, which is 15%. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.68 or 68%.}
