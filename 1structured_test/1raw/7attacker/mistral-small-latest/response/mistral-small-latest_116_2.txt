{probability: 0.66,

Explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem.

Let's denote E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

We are given that P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

We also need to find P(W|not E), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height given that the person is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, and half of the sample is shorter than 185 cm, P(W|not E) = 0.3 (1 - 0.2).

We also know that P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(E|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / (P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E))

Since P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85, we can substitute these values to get:

P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85)

This simplifies to approximately 0.66.}
