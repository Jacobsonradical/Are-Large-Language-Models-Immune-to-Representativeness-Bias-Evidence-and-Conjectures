{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm but the witness misidentified them. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, the probability of this error is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.62, which is our estimate.}
