{probability: 0.58, Given that the witness correctly identifies height in 80% of the cases, and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is the proportion of shorter people (0.85) multiplied by the witness's error rate (0.2), which gives 0.17. So, 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.58.}
