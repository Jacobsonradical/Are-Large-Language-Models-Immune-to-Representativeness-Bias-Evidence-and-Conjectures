{probability: 0.583, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height, and considering that the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.583.}
