{probability: 0.72, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this error is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%. So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, accounting for both correct identification and error, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72, or 72%.}
