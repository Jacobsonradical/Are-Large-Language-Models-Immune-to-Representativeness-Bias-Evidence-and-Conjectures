{probability: 0.54, This is calculated by using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood (a) of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.54.}
