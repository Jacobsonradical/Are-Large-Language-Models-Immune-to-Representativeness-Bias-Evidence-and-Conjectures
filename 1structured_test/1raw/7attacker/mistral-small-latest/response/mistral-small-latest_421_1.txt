{probability: 0.69, The attacker was identified by the witness as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller by adjusting for the witness's accuracy. This can be calculated as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.69 or 69%.}
