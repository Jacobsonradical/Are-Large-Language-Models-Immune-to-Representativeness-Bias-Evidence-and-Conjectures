{probability: 0.66, Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the witness is 80% correct in their judgments, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability of the witness being correct given that they made this identification. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.15 * 0.2) = 0.66 or 66%.}
