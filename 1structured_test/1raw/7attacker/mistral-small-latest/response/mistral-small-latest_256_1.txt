{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. To find the overall probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the witness's errors as well. The witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller 10% of the time (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1). So, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, either correctly identified or misidentified, is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22. But the question asks for the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, so we divide 0.12 (the correct identification rate) by 0.22 (the total probability of being identified as such), which gives us approximately 0.64 or 64%.}
