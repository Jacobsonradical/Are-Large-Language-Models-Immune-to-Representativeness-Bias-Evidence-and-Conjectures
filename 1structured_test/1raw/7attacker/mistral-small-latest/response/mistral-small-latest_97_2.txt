{probability: 0.54,
Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(E|W), the probability of E given W.

We can use Bayes' theorem: P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

From the problem, we have:
P(E) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (let's denote this as E') and where the attacker is 185 cm or taller (E).
P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|E') * P(E')
We know P(E') = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
P(W|E') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height. Since the witness's errors are uniformly distributed, P(W|E') = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (20% error rate and half of the errors would result in identifying a shorter person as taller).

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Now we can find P(E|W):
P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.54}
