Based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights under similar conditions.
3. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

So, {probability: 0.8}
