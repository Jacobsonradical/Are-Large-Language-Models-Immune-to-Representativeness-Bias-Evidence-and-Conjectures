Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability as follows:

First, we know from information "a" that the probability of a randomly selected person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Second, we know from information "b" that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, the probability that they are actually that tall is 0.8.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by multiplying the two probabilities:

0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability that the witness is correct) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.

{probability: 0.12}
