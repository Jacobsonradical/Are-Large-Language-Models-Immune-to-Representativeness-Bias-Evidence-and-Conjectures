{probability: 0.75, To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know from the information that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be calculated using the total probability theorem: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) = 0.85 and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.75.}
