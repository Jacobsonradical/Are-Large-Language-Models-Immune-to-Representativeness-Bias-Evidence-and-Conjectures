{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% in identifying people's height, and the fact that half the people in their sample were 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.80. Since 15% of the population in the city are 185 cm or taller, the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the question seems to be asking for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is (0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.58.}
