{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying such heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have misidentified a shorter person as tall. Given the witness's 20% error rate, the probability of misidentifying a shorter person as tall is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.1 (misidentification) = 0.64.}
