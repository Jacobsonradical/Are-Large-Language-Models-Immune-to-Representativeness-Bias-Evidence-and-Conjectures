{probability: 0.7, This estimate is based on Bayes' Theorem. The prior probability (from information b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness's accuracy (from information a) is 80%, so the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.7 or 70%.}
