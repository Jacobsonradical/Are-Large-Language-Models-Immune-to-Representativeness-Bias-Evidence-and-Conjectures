{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we have the prior probability (P(A)) that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15. Then, we have the conditional probability (P(W|A)) that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that tall, which is 0.8. We also need the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (P(W|not A)), which is 0.2 (since half of the sample is shorter than 185 cm and the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)). Plugging in the values, we get P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.64.}
