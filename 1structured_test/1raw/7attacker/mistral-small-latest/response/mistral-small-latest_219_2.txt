{probability: 0.912, explanation: Given the information, we first need to consider the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. Then we consider the witness's accuracy in identifying people's heights. The witness makes correct identifications 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is calculated as follows: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says so). We know P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8. To find P(witness says so), we use the law of total probability: P(witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm). Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(witness says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20. And P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85. Plugging in the values, we get P(witness says so) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.29. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29, which is approximately 0.912.}
