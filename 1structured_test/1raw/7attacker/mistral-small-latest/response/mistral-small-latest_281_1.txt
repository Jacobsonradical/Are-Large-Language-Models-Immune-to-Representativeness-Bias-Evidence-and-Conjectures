{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, there's a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is of this height. However, the witness's accuracy needs to be considered. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when given a sample of people half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) is 0.8. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.64.}
