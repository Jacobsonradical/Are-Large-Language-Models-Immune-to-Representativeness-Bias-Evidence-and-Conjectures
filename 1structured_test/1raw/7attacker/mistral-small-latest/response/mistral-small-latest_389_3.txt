{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying this height (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the proportion of the population that the witness would incorrectly identify as being 185 cm or taller despite actually being shorter (0.5 * 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.015), which gives a total of 0.12 + 0.015 = 0.135 or 64% when expressed as a percentage.}
