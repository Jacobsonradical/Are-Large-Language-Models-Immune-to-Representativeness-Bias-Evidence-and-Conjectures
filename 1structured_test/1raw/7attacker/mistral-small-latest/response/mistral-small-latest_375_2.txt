{probability: 0.88, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability that the witness correctly identified a shorter person as being shorter (0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4), which gives us a total probability of 0.52 + 0.12 = 0.88.}
