{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the expected probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, this does not account for the possibility that the witness might have incorrectly identified a shorter person as tall. To account for this, we need to consider the probability of the witness making an error when the actual height is less than 185 cm. Given that half the population is shorter, and the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, the probability of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as tall is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.68.}
