{probability: 0.68, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate. Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made an error and identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to consider this information in our estimate. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such using Bayes' theorem. This gives us a probability of 0.29 / (0.29 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)) â‰ˆ 0.68.}
