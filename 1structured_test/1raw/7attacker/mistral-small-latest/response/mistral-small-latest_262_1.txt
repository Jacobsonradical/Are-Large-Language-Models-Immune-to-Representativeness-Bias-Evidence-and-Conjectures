{probability: 0.93, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we know that the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15. Then, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification) is calculated as follows: P(attacker is 185 cm+ | witness says 185 cm+) = [P(witness says 185 cm+ | attacker is 185 cm+) * P(attacker is 185 cm+)] / P(witness says 185 cm+) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.93}
