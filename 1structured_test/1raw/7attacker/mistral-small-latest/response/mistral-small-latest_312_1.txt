Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information a.
- P(W|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information b.
- P(W|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the error rate of 0.2 for the witness, multiplied by the proportion of shorter people in the sample (0.5), resulting in 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values: P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] = 0.5556

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.556.

Answer: {probability: 0.556}
