{probability: 0.576, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% * 80% = 0.12 * 0.8 = 0.096. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. This is 85% (probability of being shorter) * 20% (probability of witness error) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.096 + 0.17 = 0.576 or 57.6%.}
