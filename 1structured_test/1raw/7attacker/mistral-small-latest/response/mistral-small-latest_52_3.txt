{probability: 0.87, The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller. Given that the attacker was identified as such, we can assume the witness was correct in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) multiplied by 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city), which equals 0.87 or 87%.}
