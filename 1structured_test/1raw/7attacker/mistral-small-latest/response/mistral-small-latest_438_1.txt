{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as such. We want to find P(A|W).

P(A) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (from the population distribution)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
