{probability: 0.56, Given that the witness correctly identified heights 80% of the time and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, the probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed that tall, is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.56.}
