{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter but the witness made an error. The probability of this is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since the question asks for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to adjust this probability based on the witness's statement. The witness states that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is a positive result. To calculate the probability of a positive result given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, we use the formula P(positive|true) = true positives / (true positives + false negatives). In this case, true positives are 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, and false negatives are 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03. Therefore, P(positive|true) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.8. Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement: P(true|positive) = P(positive|true) * P(true) / P(positive). Here, P(true) is 0.15, and P(positive) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(positive) = P(positive|true) * P(true) + P(positive|false) * P(false), where P(false) is 0.85, and P(positive|false) is the probability of the witness incorrectly stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, P(positive) = 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.28. Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get P(true|positive) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 = 0.72.}
