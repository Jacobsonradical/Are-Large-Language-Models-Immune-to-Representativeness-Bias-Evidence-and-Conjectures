{probability: 0.916, The attacker's height is estimated to be 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.916.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
2. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time under similar conditions.
3. Assuming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height is 0.80.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as such) = [P(witness identified as such | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identified as such)
5. P(witness identified as such) = [P(witness identified as such | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(witness identified as such | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
6. Since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(witness identified as such | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
7. Plugging in the values, we get P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as such) â‰ˆ 0.916

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.916.
