{probability: 0.58, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (based on information a) is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so the likelihood is 0.8. Bayes' theorem gives us a posterior probability of 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.58.}
