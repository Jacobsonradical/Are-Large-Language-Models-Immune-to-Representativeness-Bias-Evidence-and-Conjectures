{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that the witness is right 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, this is the probability that the attacker is tall and the witness correctly identified it. To find the overall probability that the attacker is tall, we also need to consider the scenario where the attacker is tall but the witness made an error (which happens 20% of the time). So, the total probability is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.15 (population proportion) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 76% when expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1.}
