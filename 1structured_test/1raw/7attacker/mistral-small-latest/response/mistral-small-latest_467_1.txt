Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as T. We want to find P(A|T), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|T) = P(T|A) * P(A) / P(T)

From the information:
P(T|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(T), we can use the law of total probability: P(T) = P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(T|not A) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|T) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.

Final answer: {probability: 0.545}
