{probability: 0.88, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). Using Bayes' theorem, we get: posterior probability = (likelihood * prior) / (likelihood * prior + likelihood * (1 - prior)). Substituting the values, we get: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.88.}
