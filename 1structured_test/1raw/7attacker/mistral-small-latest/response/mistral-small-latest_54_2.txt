{probability: 0.52,

This is a problem of conditional probability. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, they incorrectly identify height 20% of the time. So, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, substituting P(W), P(W|A), and P(A) into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52.}
