{probability: 0.55, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from a) is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability (the probability we want to estimate) is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.55.}
