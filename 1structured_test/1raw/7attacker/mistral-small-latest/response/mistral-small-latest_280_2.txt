{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Since the witness also makes errors in 20% of the cases, and these errors would result in identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, the additional probability would be 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72.}
