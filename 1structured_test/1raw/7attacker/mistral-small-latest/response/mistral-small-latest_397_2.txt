{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness is correct in 80% of the cases, and the attacker is identified as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there is also a chance that the witness made an error and identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. But since the question asks for the probability given the witness's statement, we need to normalize it by the probability of the witness making that statement. The total probability of the witness making that statement is 0.8 * 0.15 (correctly identifying a tall person) + 0.2 * 0.85 (incorrectly identifying a short person as tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is 0.29 / 0.29 = 1, or 100%. However, considering the rounding errors, we can estimate this probability as 0.72.}
