{probability: 0.68, Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) with the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8). Therefore, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.68 or 68%.}
