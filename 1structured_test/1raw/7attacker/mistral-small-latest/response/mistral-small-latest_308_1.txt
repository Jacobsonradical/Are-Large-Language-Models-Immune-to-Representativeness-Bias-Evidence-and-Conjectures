{probability: 0.68, The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness's accuracy is 80% under similar conditions, there's a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, multiplying these two probabilities gives us a probability of approximately 0.68, or 68%, that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
