{probability: 0.76, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate of the population (0.15) and the witness's accuracy rate (0.8). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. However, the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness made an error in 20% of cases, there's a 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness misidentified them. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + (1 - 0.03) = 0.76 or 76%.}
