{probability: 0.54, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy rate is 80% in similar conditions. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also has a 20% error rate. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.54 or 54%.}
