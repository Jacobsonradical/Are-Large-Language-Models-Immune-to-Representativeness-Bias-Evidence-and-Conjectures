{probability: 0.68, based on Bayes' theorem and the given information}

Explanation:

Let's denote:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability)
P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (likelihood)
P(B): The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (total probability)
P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such (posterior probability)

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.68

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.68.
