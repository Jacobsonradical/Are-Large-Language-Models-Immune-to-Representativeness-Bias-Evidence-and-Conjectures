{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to account for the false positive rate. The false positive rate is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is calculated as the proportion of shorter people that the witness incorrectly identified as taller: (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.1. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 12% / (12% + 10%) = 0.64 or 64%.}
