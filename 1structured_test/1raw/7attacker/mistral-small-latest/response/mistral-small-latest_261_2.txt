{probability: 0.64, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The conditional probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.64.}
