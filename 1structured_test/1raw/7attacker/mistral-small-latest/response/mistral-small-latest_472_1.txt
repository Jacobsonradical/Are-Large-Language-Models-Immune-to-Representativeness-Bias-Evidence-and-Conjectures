{probability: 0.64, explanation: Taking into account the information provided, we first need to consider the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. Then, we consider the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we multiply the two probabilities. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.64 or 64%.}
