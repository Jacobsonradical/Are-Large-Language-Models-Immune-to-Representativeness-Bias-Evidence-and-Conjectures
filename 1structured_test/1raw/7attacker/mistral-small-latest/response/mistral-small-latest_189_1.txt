Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying height is 80%.
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.8}
