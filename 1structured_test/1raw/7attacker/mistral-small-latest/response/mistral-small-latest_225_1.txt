Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.3636

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3636.

Solution in the required format:
{probability: 0.3636}
