{probability: 0.88, based on Bayes' theorem and the given information}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(T)
2. From information "a", we know that P(T) = 0.15
3. Let's denote the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as P(W|T)
4. From information "b", we know that P(W|T) = 0.8
5. We want to find P(T|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such
6. By Bayes' theorem, P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)
7. P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)
8. P(not T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85
9. P(W|not T) represents the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is the error rate given in information "b", so P(W|not T) = 0.2
10. Plugging in the values, we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21
11. Finally, P(T|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.88

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.88.
