{probability: 0.54, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.54.}
