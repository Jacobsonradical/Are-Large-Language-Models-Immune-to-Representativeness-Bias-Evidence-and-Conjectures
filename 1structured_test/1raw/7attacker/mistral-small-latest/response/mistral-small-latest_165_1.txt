{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying people of that height (0.8), which results in 0.12. Then, we add this to the witness's error rate (0.2) in identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm multiplied by the proportion of the population that is shorter (0.85), which results in 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
