{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by taking into account the witness's accuracy in identifying height, the distribution of heights in the city, and applying Bayes' theorem. Specifically, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% base rate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness identified the attacker as such, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, the updated probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2), which equals approximately 0.68.}
