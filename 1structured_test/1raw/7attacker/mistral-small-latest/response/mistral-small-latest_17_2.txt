{probability: 0.62, Explanation: Given the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the distribution of heights in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as such. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). From the information provided, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.62.}
