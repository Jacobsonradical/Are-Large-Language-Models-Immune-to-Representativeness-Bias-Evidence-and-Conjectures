{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the 15% probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a) with the 80% probability that the witness correctly identified the height (from information b). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness's errors would lead to incorrectly identifying shorter people as taller, we also need to consider the probability of this happening. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (half the population is shorter) * 0.2 (20% error rate) = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.64 or 64%.}
