{probability: 0.89,

Explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem statement, P(A) = 0.15, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city.

P(W|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

To find P(W), we need to consider both P(W|A) and P(W|not A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.

P(W|not A) = 0.2, the probability of the witness making an error, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm.
P(not A) = 0.85, the proportion of people shorter than 185 cm in the city.

So, P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.21 + 0.17 = 0.38

Finally, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.38 â‰ˆ 0.89

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.89.}
