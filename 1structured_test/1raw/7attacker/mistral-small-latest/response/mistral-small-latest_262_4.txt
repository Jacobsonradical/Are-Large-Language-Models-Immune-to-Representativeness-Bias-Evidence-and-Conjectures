{probability: 0.92, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.92. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability that the witness correctly identified a tall person even though they were not actually tall (0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03). So, 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.92 or 92%.}
