{probability: 0.64, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying such individuals (0.8), resulting in a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) by the witness's error rate (0.2), resulting in a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we only consider the correct identification scenario. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
