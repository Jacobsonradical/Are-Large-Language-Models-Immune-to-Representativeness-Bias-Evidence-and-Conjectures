{probability: 0.68, The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying height (0.8), which gives 0.12, and then adding the product of the percentage of the population shorter than 185 cm (0.85) and the witness's error rate in identifying height as taller (0.2), which gives 0.16. So, 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28. However, since the witness identified the attacker as taller, we only consider the cases where the witness is correct, so we divide 0.12 by the total probability of the witness's assessment (0.12 + 0.16), which gives approximately 0.68.}
