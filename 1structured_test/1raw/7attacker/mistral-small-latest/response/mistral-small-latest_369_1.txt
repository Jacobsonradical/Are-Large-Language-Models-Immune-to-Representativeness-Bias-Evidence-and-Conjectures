{probability: 0.68, This is calculated as follows: The witness has an 80% accuracy rate when identifying people taller than 185 cm. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of being tall) = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is tall but the witness made a mistake. This is 0.2 (error rate) * 0.15 (probability of being tall) = 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 68% when expressed as a percentage.}
