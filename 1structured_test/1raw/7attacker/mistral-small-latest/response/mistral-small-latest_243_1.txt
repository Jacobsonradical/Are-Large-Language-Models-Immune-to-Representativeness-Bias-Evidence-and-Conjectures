{probability: 0.62, Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem can be used here: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller. B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying tall people), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of tall people in the city), and P(B) can be calculated using total probability theorem: P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|not A)*P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23.

So, P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 = approximately 0.62.}
