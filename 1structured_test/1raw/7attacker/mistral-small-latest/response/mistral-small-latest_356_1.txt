{probability: 0.52, explanation: Bayes' theorem can be used to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W).

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (from information a, assuming the witness makes the same error rate for people shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
