{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying such a person (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness correctly identified a taller person who actually makes up a smaller proportion of the population. This is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller (0.10, which is 0.5 * 0.2) times the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm (0.85). So, 0.10 * 0.85 = 0.085. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205 or approximately 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.}
