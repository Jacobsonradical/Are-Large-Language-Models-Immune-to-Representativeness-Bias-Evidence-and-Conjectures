{probability: 0.77, The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, and in this case, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness's errors would mostly lie in identifying shorter people as taller. Therefore, we need to adjust the 80% to account for this bias. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem, which gives us a probability of approximately 0.77 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.}
