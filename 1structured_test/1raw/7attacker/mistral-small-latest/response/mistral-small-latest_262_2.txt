{probability: 0.676, explanation: The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we have the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population). The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. To find the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) = [P(witness testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness testimony). P(witness testimony) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(witness testimony) = [P(witness testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(witness testimony | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(witness testimony | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2. Plugging in the values, we get: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) â‰ˆ 0.676.}
