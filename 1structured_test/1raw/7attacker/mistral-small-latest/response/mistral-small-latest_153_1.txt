{probability: 0.89, given the 80% accuracy of the witness and the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 for correctly identifying a tall attacker and 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 for incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall. So, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15, but we also need to account for the 85% of the population that is shorter than 185 cm and the witness's 20% error rate in identifying them as tall, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.89.}
