Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller).

We also need P(W|not A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness correctly identifies height in 80% of cases, they will incorrectly identify height in 20% of cases. Therefore, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)], where P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Calculating the probability: P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4651.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4651}.
