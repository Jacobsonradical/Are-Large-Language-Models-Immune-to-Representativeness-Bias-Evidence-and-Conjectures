{probability: 0.66,

Explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we can assume that the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 80%. However, since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust this probability based on the prior probability of the attacker's height. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.66 or 66%.}
