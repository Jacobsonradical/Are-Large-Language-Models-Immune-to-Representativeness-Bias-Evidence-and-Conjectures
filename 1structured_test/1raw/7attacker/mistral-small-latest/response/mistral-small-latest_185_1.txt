Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
