{probability: 0.54, This estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.54 or 54%.}
