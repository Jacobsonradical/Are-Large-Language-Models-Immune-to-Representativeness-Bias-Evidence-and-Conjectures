{probability: 0.68, given the 80% accuracy of the witness and the 15% of the population being 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness can also make an error by identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this error is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68.}
