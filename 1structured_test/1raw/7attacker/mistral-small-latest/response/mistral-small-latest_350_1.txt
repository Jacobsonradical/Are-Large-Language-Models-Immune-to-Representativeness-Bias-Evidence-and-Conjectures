{probability: 0.84, estimate: Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.84. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height under those conditions (0.80).}
