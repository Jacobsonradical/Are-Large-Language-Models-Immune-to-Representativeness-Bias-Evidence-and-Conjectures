Based on Bayes' theorem and the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows:

1. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.
2. We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying taller people), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population being 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying shorter people).
3. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].
4. Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we can calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
5. Finally, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.475.

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.475}.
