{probability: 0.625, explanation: The problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).
We know from the problem:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
To find P(B), we use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
Substituting these values, we get P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.22.
Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.625.}
