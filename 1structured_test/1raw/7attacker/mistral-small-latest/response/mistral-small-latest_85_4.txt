{probability: 0.9375, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.9375 or 93.75%.}
