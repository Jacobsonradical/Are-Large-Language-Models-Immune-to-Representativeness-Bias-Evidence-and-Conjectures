{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.58.}
