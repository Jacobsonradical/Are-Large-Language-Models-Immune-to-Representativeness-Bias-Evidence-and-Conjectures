{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness is 80% accurate in identifying heights, the probability of them correctly identifying a taller person given that the person is taller is 0.8. However, since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for this. So, the probability that the attacker is taller AND the witness correctly identified them as such is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have incorrectly identified a shorter person as taller. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.85 (the proportion of shorter people). This equals 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or approximately 64% when expressed as a probability between 0 and 1.}
