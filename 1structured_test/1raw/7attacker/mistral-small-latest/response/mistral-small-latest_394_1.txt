{probability: 0.89, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, there is a 0.15 base probability. Given the witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying height, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this error is 0.85 (the percentage of the population that is shorter) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate) = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%. However, this number represents the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, not the actual probability that the attacker is that tall. To find the actual probability, we divide the 0.12 (the probability that the witness was correct) by the 0.29 (the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller), which gives an estimate of 0.89 or 89%.}
