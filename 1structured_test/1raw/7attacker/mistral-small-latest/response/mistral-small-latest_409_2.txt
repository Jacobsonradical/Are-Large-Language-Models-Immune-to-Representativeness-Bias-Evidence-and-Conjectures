{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions, there's an 80% chance they correctly identified the attacker's height. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker was indeed that height is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there's also a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than that height, the estimated probability of this error is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and making that error, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
