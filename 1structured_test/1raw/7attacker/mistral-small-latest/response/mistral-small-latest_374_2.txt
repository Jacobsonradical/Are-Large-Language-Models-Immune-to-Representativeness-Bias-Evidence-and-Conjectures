{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, the estimated probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.76.}
