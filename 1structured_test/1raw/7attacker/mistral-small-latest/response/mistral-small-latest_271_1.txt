{probability: 0.39, The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller. Given that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could have also made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.39.}
