{probability: 0.54, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (prior probability), and the witness correctly identifies people's height 80% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as tall is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.54.}
