{probability: 0.58, based on the information given, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 58%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%.
2. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will identify correctly.
3. However, even if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, there's still a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is: (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)] = approximately 0.58.
