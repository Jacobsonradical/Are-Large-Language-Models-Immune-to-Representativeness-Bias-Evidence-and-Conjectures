{probability: 0.9, Given the witness's 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights and the fact that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 x 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness did identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, so we should consider this positive identification. Assuming the witness's errors are random, the probability of a false positive (identifying a shorter person as taller) would be 0.2 x 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.9 or 90%.}
