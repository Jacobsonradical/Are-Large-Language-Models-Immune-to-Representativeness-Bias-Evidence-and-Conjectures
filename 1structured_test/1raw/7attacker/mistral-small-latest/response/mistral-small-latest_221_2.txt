{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness is correct when identifying heights, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of being 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. However, this is the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To get the overall probability, we need to account for the possibility that the witness is incorrect. Using Bayes' theorem, the overall probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.64.}
