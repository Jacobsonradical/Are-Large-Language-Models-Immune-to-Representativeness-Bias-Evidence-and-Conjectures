{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness is correct in 80% of cases and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the fact that the witness might be wrong but the attacker is actually taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter, the probability that the witness is wrong but the attacker is taller is 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 64% when expressed as a percentage.}
