{probability: 0.704,

Explanation:
Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our prior probability.
The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height under similar conditions.
Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a person who is actually shorter as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter, this error would result in a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
Adding these probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.704.}
