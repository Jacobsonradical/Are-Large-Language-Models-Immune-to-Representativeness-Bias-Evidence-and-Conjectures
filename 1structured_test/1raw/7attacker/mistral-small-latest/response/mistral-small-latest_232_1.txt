{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability, based on information a, is 0.15. The witness's accuracy in identifying tall people is 0.8 (80%), and their error rate for mistaking short people as tall is 0.1 (20% of the 50% short people). So, the likelihood of the witness being correct given a tall attacker is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness being incorrect (mistaking a short person for a tall one) is 0.1. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.8*0.15) / ((0.8*0.15) + (0.1*0.85)) = 0.64.}
