{probability: 0.68, The witness correctly identified the height in 80% of cases among people who are 185 cm or taller. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there's also a chance that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. The probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68 or 68%.}
