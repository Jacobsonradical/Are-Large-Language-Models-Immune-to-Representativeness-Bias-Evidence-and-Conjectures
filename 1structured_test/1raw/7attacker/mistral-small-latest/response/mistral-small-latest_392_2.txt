{probability: 0.92, based on the available information}

Here's the reasoning:
1. According to the witness's accuracy in estimating height, the probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is 80%.
2. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 20%.
3. Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, when in reality the attacker is shorter, is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
5. Subtracting this probability from 1 (since there are only two possibilities: the attacker is either shorter or taller than 185 cm), we get the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification: 1 - 0.17 = 0.92 or 92%.
