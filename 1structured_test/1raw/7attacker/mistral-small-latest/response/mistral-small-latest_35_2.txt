{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies the height, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
