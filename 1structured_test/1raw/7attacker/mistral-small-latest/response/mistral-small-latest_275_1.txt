{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's statement) = P(witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness's statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.68.}
