{probability: 0.92, This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the population distribution (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.80), which equals 0.15*0.80 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, so we need to adjust for this. This can be done using Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is (0.15*0.8)/(0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.92.}
