{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our prior probability. The witness is correct 80% of the time for people of this height, so we multiply the prior probability by the witness's accuracy rate. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.58 or 58%.}
