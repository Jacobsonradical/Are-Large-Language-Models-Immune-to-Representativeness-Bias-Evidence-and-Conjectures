{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate in identifying such individuals (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, to account for the witness's errors in identifying shorter people as tall, we multiply the proportion of the population that is shorter (0.85) by the witness's error rate in such cases (0.2), which equals 0.17. Adding these two values together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, this probability is for the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, not the actual probability of the attacker's height. To estimate the actual probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from the population data) is 0.15. The likelihood (witness identifying a tall person as tall) is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness's mistake (witness identifying a short person as tall) is 0.17. Therefore, the posterior probability (estimated probability of the attacker's height) is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17) = 0.68.}
