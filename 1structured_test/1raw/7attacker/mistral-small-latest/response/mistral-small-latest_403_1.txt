Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's denote:

E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

P(E) = 0.15 (from b)
P(W|E) = 0.8 (from a, this is the witness's accuracy when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not E) = 0.2 (from a, this is the witness's error rate when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)
P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85 (from b)

Bayes' theorem states that P(E|W) = P(W|E)*P(E) / [P(W|E)*P(E) + P(W|not E)*P(not E)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4.

So, the estimate is: {probability: 0.4}
