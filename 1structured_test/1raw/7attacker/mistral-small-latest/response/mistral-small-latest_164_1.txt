{probability: 0.54, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness, who is correct 80% of the time, identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. So, we can adjust our probability using Bayes' theorem. The updated probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.54.}
