{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we also need to consider the probability of the witness making a false positive identification. This would be the probability of a shorter person (85% of the population) being incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller (20% error rate). So, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or approximately 0.64 when considering only the witness's identification.}
