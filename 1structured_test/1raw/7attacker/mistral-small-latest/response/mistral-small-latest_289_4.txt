{probability: 0.704, The attacker being 185 cm or taller is estimated at a 70.4% probability. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), resulting in 0.12. To account for the possibility that the witness could have misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, we add the product of the proportion of the population that is shorter (0.85) and the witness's error rate (0.2), which equals 0.17. The sum of these two values (0.12 + 0.17) is 0.29, or 29%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the conditional probability. This is done by dividing 0.12 by the sum of 0.12 and 0.17, which results in approximately 0.704 or 70.4%.}
