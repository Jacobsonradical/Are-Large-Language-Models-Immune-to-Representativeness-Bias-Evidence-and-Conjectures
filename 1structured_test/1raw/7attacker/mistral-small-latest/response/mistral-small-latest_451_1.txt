{probability: 0.84,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the event of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as B. We want to find P(A|B), which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where they are not. Let's denote the event of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm as not A. We know that P(not A) = 0.85. We also know that the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can use the law of total probability to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.84}
