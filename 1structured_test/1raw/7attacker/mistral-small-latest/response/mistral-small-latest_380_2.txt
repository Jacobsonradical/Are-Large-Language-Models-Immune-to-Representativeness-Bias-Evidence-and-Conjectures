{probability: 0.91,

Explanation:
Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
The witness correctly identified height in 80% of cases, so the probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.8.
Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so:
Posterior probability = (prior probability * likelihood) / (prior probability * likelihood + prior probability * (1 - likelihood) + (1 - prior probability) * (1 - specificity))
Plugging in the numbers, we get: 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.2) â‰ˆ 0.91. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.91.}
