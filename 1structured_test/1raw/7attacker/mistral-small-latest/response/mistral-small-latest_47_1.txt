{probability: 0.72,

Explanation: Assuming that the witness's ability to judge height is independent of the actual height distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (with probability 0.85) and the witness makes a mistake, and where the attacker is 185 cm or taller (with probability 0.15) and the witness is correct.

So, P(B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) + P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.256

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.256 â‰ˆ 0.72}
