{probability: 0.68, Given the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the population distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68. This is calculated by multiplying the witness's accuracy (0.8) with the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15).}
