{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.80 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. However, since the witness also makes errors, we need to consider the possibility that the attacker is actually shorter but was misidentified. This happens 20% of the time (witness error rate) for people who are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
