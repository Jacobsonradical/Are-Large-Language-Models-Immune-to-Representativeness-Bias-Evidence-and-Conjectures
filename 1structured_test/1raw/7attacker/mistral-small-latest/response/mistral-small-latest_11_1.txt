{probability: 0.45, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that he truly is (true positive rate from a) is 0.8. So, the posterior probability (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement) is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.45.}
