{probability: 0.68, rounding to two decimal places, the estimated probability is 0.68 or 68%}

Explanation: The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when given a sample of people half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker has this height is the product of the percentage of the population with that height and the witness's accuracy rate in identifying it: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the attacker was identified as such, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made a correct identification out of the shorter population. There's a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17% chance that the witness made an incorrect identification. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the correct identification probability and the incorrect identification probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68 or 68%.
