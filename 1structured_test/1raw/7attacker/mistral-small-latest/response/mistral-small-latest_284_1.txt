{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying height, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, this probability is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. The total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
