{probability: 0.96, This estimate is calculated by considering the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) and the witness's accuracy in identifying height (0.8). Multiplying these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 or 12%. However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows: P(Attacker is tall|Witness says tall) = [P(Witness says tall|Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness says tall). P(Witness says tall) = P(Witness says tall|Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness says tall|Attacker is not tall) * P(Attacker is not tall). Given that P(Witness says tall|Attacker is not tall) is the error rate of the witness (0.2) and P(Attacker is not tall) is 0.85, we can calculate P(Witness says tall) as 0.12 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives us an estimated probability of 0.12/0.29 â‰ˆ 0.96 or 96%.}
