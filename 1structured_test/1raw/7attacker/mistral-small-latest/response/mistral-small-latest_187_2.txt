{probability: 0.45, explanation: The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time. However, 85% of the population is actually shorter than 185 cm. So, we need to adjust for this. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (since the witness is right 80% of the time when identifying tall people, and only 15% of the population is tall). But the witness said the attacker was tall, so we're only considering the scenario where the witness is correct. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.45.}
