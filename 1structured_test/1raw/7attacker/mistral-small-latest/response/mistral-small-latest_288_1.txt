{probability: 0.84, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the probability that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as 0.84.}
