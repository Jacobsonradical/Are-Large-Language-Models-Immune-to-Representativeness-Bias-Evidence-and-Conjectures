{probability: 0.62,
Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct, and where the attacker is shorter but the witness makes an error.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.62}
