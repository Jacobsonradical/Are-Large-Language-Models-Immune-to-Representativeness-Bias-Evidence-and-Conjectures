{probability: 0.941, explanation: Given that the attacker is identified by the witness as 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability of this identification being correct. To do this, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

From the information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.

Now we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height of the attacker.

Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.5 (for those who are actually 185 cm or taller) + 0.2 * 0.5 (for those who are actually shorter than 185 cm). This gives us P(B) = 0.5.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.941 or 94.1%}
