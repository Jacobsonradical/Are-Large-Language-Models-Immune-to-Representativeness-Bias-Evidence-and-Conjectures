{probability: 0.58, The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 58%. This is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the height (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being tall (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), which gives us the final estimate of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58 or 58%.}
