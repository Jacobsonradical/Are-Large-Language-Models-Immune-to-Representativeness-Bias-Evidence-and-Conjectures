{probability: 0.86, or 86%}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
3. So, the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a taller person is 0.80 (80%).
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.
5. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so the probability of making an error when the person is shorter is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.
6. But this error would mean identifying a shorter person as taller, which contradicts our given information. So, we subtract this probability from our initial calculation: 0.12 - 0.17 = -0.05.
7. Since probability cannot be negative, we interpret this as meaning that the witness's identification adds some (not negative) likelihood to the attacker being taller. The total probability of the population being taller is 0.15, and the additional likelihood provided by the witness's testimony is 0.05. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20, or 20%.
8. However, I made an error in the calculation. The probability should be the witness's accuracy (0.8) divided by the probability of the witness making a correct identification or an error when the person is taller (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85). This gives an estimated probability of 0.86, or 86%.
