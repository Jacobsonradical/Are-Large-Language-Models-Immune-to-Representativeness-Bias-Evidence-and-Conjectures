{probability: 0.68, Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68. This is calculated by using Bayes' theorem.}
