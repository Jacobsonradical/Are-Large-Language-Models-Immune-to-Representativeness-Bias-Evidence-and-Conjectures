{probability: 0.475, This is calculated by using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.475.}
