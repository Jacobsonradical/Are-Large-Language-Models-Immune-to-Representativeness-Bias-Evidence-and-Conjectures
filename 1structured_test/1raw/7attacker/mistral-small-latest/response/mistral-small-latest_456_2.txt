{probability: 0.65, This estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.65 or 65%.}
