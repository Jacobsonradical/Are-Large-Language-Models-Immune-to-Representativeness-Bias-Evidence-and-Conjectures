{probability: 0.65, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and the people who are 185 cm or taller constitute only 15% of the population, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that the witness was correct given that they made that identification. This can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15 (from the population data), and P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller and incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.23. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.65.}
