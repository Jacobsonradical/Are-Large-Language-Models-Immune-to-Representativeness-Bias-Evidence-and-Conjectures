{probability: 0.76, This estimate assumes that the witness has the same accuracy rate regardless of the person's height and that the witness's observations are independent of the population statistics. So, given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for the false positive rate. The witness makes a false positive error in 20% of cases where the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% of the population. So, the probability of a false positive is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%. The total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the true positive probability and the false positive probability, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%. However, since the question asks for the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.17) = 0.76, or 76%.}
