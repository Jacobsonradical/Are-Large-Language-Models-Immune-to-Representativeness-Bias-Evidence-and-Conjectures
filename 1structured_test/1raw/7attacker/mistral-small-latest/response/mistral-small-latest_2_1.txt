Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

First, we know that the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.

The witness correctly identifies people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

So, if we consider a scenario where the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height is 0.8 (80%).

If we consider a scenario where the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement) as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's statement) = [P(witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness's statement | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.34

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.34.

Answer: {probability: 0.34}
