{probability: 0.76, based on the provided information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.76 or 76%.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identified a person's height when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. From the witness's record, they correctly identify height 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identified their height is 0.8.
3. Now, we need to consider the base rate of the population. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).
5. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
6. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
7. P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city).
8. We can assume that P(B) is approximately the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. Since half of the witness's sample was 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, P(B) ≈ 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.52.
9. Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.52 ≈ 0.76.
