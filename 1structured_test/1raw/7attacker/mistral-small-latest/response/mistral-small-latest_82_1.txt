{probability: 0.78, Given that the witness is 80% accurate and the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, and considering that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, this is the probability of the witness being correct given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which gives us an estimated probability of 0.78.}
