{probability: 0.7875,

This is a problem of conditional probability, which you can solve using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when he is not. Let's denote C as the complementary event of A (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
  - P(B|C) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(C) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|C) * P(C) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.245

Substituting the probabilities into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.245 ≈ 0.7875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7875.}
