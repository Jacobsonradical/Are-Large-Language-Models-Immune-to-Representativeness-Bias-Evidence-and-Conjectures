{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% and the fact that half of the sample was 185 cm or taller, the probability of correctly identifying a taller person is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, is 0.4 / 0.15 = 0.64 (or approximately 64%).}
