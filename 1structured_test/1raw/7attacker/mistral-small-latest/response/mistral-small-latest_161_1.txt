{probability: 0.64, This is based on Bayes' theorem. Given that the attacker was identified by the witness as 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%, and the base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller would be approximately 0.64.}
