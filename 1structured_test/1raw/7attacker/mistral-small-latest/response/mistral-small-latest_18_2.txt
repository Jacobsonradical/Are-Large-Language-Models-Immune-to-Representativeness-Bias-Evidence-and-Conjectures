{probability: 0.6875,

Explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of witness identifying the attacker's height correctly when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city's population).

The probability we want to find is P(A|B), which can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A), or the attacker is shorter (event A' or not A).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases when the attacker is actually shorter, P(B|A') = 0.2. And since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(A') = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25 = 0.6875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.6875.}
