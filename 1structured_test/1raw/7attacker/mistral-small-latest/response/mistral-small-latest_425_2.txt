  "explanation": "This is a problem of conditional probability. Let's denote the event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). We know from the problem that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where he is not. So P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We also know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Now, P(B|not A) represents the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is the opposite of the witness identifying the height correctly, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23. Finally, plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.69."
