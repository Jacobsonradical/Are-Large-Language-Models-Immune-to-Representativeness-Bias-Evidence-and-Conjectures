  "probability": 0.58,
  "explanation": "Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we start with a base probability of 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time under similar conditions, so we multiply the base probability by 0.8 to get an estimated probability of 0.12 (0.15 * 0.8). However, the witness can also misidentify shorter people as being 185 cm or taller. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.10 (0.5 * 0.2). Adding these two probabilities together, we get an estimated probability of 0.58 (0.12 + 0.10) that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller."
