{probability: 0.72, given the witness's accuracy and the distribution of heights in the city's population}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the city's population, with 85% of the attackers being shorter than 185 cm and 15% being 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height (in this case, 185 cm or taller) in 80% of the cases when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
3. We can calculate the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller by multiplying the actual probability of an attacker being that height by the witness's accuracy: 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12.
4. However, this calculation does not account for the cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller. This happens 20% of the time, so for the 85% of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
5. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72 or 72%.
