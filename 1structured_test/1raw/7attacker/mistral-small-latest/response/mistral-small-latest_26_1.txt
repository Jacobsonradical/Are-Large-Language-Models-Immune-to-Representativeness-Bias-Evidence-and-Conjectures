{probability: 0.64,
explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our initial probability. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height under similar conditions. Therefore, to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we multiply these two probabilities together. That gives us 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this estimate only accounts for the cases where the witness is correct. We also need to account for the possibility that the witness is incorrect but the attacker is still 185 cm or taller. The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so if we consider the 85% of the population that is shorter than 185 cm, the witness might incorrectly identify one of them as being 185 cm or taller. This would be a false positive and occurs at a rate of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us our final estimate: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or approximately 29%. However, since the question asks for an estimate between 0 and 1, we can interpret this as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. So, 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.71) â‰ˆ 0.64.}
