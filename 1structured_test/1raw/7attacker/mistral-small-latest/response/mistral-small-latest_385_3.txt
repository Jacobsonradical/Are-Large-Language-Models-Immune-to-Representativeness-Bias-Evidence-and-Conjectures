Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

First, we know that the probability of a randomly selected person from the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says so)

We can calculate P(witness says so) using total probability:

P(witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given that the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter is 0.2. And since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.

So, P(witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.5217

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.5217}
