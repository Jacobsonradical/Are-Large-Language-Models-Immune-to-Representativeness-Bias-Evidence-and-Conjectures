{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying such people, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.80 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was 185 cm or taller but the witness made an error. This is 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.20 (witness's error rate) = 0.03 or 3%. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 15%. However, we need to convert this to the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, this is calculated as: 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85*0.20) = 0.64 or 64%.}
