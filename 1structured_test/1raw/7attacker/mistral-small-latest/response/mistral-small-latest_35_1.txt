{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height, the probability that the witness is correct about the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, this only considers the scenario where the witness is correct. We also need to consider the scenario where the witness is incorrect, but the attacker is actually taller than 185 cm. This happens when the witness is looking at someone who is shorter than 185 cm (85% of the population) and incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (which happens 20% of the time). So, the probability of this scenario is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
