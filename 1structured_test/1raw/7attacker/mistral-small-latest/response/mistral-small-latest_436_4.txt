{probability: 0.72, or 72%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time under similar conditions.
3. So, the probability that the witness is correct when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.
4. However, the witness can also make a mistake when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm. This happens in 20% of cases, and since 85% of the population is shorter, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.
5. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct (12%) and making an error (17%), which equals 0.72, or 72%.
