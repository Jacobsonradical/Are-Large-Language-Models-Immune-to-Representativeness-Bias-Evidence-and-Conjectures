{probability: 0.84,
Explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

According to the information, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter).

The witness's accuracy is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall). The witness's error rate when the person is actually shorter is 20%, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values: P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.84}
