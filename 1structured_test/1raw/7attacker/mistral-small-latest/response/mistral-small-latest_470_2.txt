{probability: 0.69, The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.69.}
