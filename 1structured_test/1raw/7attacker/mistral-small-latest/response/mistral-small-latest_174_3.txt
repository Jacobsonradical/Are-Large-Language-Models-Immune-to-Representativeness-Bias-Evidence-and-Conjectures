{probability: 0.68, Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time under similar conditions, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller in the witness's sample, the witness would make an error 10% of the time (0.5*0.2), identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.68.}
