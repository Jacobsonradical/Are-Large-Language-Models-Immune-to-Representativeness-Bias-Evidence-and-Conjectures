{probability: 0.912, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the base rate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. So, if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness correctly identifying it is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(tall|witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) / P(witness). Here, P(witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) + P(witness|not tall) * P(not tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85. Plugging in the values, we get P(tall|witness) â‰ˆ 0.912.}
