{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, this means there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, the witness made an error in 20% of the cases where the person was 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 15% / (1 - 20%) = 0.76 or 76%.}
