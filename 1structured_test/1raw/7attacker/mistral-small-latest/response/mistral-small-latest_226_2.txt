{probability: 0.73, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, there's also a 0.20 (20%) chance that the witness made an error and identified a shorter person as taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this error is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.73 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.}
