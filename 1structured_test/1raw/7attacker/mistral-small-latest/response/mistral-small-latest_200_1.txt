{probability: 0.576,

Explanation:
Given the witness's accuracy of identifying height under similar conditions, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. Since the witness identifies height correctly 80% of the time and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability is 0.8.
2. However, the population distribution needs to be considered. There is only a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the city's population statistics.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
4. To calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as tall.
5. The witness makes errors 20% of the time (0.2), and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. So, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
6. Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (mistaken identification) = 0.576 or 57.6%.}
