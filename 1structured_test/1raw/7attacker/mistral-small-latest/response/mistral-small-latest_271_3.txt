{probability: 0.64, calculation: Based on the witness's accuracy and the population data, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying taller people) * 0.15 (probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness misidentified a shorter person as taller, which is 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.85 (probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
