{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the height distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. Then P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W). We know P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller), and P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.64.}
