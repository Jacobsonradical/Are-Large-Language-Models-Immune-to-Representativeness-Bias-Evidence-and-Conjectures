{probability: 0.48,
Explanation: Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, we start with a base probability of 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so we multiply the base probability by the witness's accuracy rate. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.48.}
