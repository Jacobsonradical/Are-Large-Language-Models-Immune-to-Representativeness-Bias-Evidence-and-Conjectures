{probability: 0.48, This calculation is based on the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and error rate. The probability that the witness is correct about the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness made an error. This is 0.2 (20% error rate) * 0.85 (probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.48.}
