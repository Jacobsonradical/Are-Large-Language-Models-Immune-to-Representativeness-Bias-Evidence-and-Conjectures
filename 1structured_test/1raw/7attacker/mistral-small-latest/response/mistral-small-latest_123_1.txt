{probability: 0.58, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%. However, since the witness could also misidentify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, we need to account for this. The witness makes an error in 20% of cases, so if the actual attacker was shorter, there's a 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.58.}
