{probability: 0.54, explanation: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and has an 80% accuracy rate under similar conditions. So, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. However, only 15% of the population meets this height requirement. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. But since we know the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to adjust for this. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, is (0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.54}
