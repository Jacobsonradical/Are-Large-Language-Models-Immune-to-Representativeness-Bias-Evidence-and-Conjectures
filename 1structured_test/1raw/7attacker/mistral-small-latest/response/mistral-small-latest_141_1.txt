{probability: 0.704, This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8). Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.704 or 70.4%.}
