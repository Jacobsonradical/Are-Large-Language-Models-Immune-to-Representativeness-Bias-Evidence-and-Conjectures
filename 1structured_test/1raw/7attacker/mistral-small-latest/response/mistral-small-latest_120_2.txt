{probability: 0.875, Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (P(A)) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The probability of the witness's correct identification given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)) is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (P(A|B)) is approximately 0.875.}
