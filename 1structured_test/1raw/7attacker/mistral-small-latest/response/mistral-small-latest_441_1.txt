Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

First, we know that the probability of a randomly selected person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Second, we have a witness who correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time.

Given that the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, we need to account for both the actual proportion of tall people in the population and the witness's accuracy.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is:

0.15 (probability of being tall) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate is {probability: 0.12}.
