To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We don't know P(B|~A), but we can calculate it using the information that the witness errs 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm.
P(B|~A) = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.444}
