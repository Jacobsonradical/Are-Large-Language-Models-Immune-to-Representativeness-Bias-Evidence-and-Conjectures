To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4137931}
