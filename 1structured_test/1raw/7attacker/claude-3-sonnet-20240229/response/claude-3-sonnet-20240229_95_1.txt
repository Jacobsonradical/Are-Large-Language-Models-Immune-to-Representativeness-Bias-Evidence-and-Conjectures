To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
