To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's denote the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (the witness errs 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the court's assessment, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
