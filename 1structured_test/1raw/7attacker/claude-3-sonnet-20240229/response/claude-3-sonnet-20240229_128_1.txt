To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(E) = Probability that the witness correctly identified the height = 0.8
- P(E') = Probability that the witness incorrectly identified the height = 0.2
- P(H) = Probability that a person's height is 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15
- P(H') = Probability that a person's height is shorter than 185 cm in the city = 0.85

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the height correctly.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H'))

P(E|H) = 0.8 (Witness correctly identified height when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(E|H') = 0.2 (Witness incorrectly identified height when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.41379}
