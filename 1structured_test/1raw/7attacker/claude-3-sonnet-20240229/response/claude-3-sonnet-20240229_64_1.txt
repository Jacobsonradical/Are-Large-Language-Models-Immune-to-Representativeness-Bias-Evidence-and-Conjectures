To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and combine the information from the witness's testimony and the population's height distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population's height distribution.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)

Where:
- P(B|A^c) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(A^c) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
