To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem using the given information.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time.
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(B) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
