To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and allows us to update our beliefs about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Given information:
- P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
- P(W | H < 185 cm) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H ≥ 185 cm | W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | W) = (P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm)) / P(W)

Where P(W) is the overall probability of the witness's testimony, which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm) + P(W | H < 185 cm) × P(H < 185 cm)
     = (0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27
                  = 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.444}
