To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
  Where A^c is the event that the person's height is less than 185 cm, and P(B|A^c) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
