To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(H≥185) = 0.15 (Prior probability that a person's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|H≥185) = 0.8 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|H<185) = 0.2 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H≥185|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H≥185|W) = [P(W|H≥185) × P(H≥185)] / [P(W|H≥185) × P(H≥185) + P(W|H<185) × P(H<185)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H≥185|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / [(0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)]
            = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
            = 0.12 / 0.29
            = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
