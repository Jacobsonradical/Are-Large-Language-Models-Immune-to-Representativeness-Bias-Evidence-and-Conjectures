To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given information:
- P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (prior probability)
- P(witness correctly identifies height ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8
- P(witness incorrectly identifies height < 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.2
- P(witness correctly identifies height < 185 cm | height < 185 cm) = 0.8
- P(witness incorrectly identifies height ≥ 185 cm | height < 185 cm) = 0.2

We want to find P(height ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(height ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm) = (P(witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) × P(height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm)

P(witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm) = P(witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) × P(height ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm | height < 185 cm) × P(height < 185 cm)
= 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
= 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(height ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies height ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.414 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
