To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (unknown)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A') = 0.85 (Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A) + P(A') = 1
P(A) = 1 - P(A')
P(A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Substituting P(A) = 0.15 in the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
