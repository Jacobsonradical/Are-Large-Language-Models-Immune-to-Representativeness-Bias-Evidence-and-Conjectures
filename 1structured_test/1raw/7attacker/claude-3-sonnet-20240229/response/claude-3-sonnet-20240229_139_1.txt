To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem and use the given information.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
