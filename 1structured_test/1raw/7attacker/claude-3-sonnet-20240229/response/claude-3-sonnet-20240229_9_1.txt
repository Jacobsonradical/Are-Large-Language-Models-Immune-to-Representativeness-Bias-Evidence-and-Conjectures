To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the complement of event A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Therefore, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
