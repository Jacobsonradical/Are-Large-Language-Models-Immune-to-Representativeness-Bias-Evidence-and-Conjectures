To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a")
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information "b")

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.41379}
