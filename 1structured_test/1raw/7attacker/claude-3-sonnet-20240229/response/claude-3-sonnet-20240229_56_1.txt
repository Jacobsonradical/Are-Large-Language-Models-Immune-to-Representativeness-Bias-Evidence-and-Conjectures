To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Now, we can substitute the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444444...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.444444}
