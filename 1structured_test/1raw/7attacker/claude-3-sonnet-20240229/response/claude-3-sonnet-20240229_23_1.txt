To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability based on the witness's identification.

Given information:
- Prior probability of being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.2

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of being 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
