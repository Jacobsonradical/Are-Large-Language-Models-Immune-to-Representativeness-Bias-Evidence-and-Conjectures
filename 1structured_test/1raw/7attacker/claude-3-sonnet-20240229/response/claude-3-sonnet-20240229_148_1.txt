To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(Identified | Height >= 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified 80% of people 185 cm or taller)
- P(Identified | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified 20% of people shorter than 185 cm)
- P(Height >= 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified) = (P(Identified | Height >= 185 cm) * P(Height >= 185 cm)) / (P(Identified | Height >= 185 cm) * P(Height >= 185 cm) + P(Identified | Height < 185 cm) * P(Height < 185 cm))

Substituting the given values:

P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(Height >= 185 cm | Identified) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
