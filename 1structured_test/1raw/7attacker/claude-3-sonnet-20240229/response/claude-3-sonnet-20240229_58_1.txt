To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the complement of A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

We don't have the value of P(B|A^c), but we can use the given information to calculate it:
P(B|A^c) = 1 - P(A|B^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness misidentified height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.41379}
