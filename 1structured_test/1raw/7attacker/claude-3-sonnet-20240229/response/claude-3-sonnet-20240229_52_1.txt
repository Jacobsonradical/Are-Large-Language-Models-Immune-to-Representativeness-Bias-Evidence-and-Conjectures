To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(E | H < 185 cm) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(H ≥ 185 cm | E), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H ≥ 185 cm | E) = (P(E | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm)) / P(E)

To find P(E), we use the law of total probability:
P(E) = P(E | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm) + P(E | H < 185 cm) × P(H < 185 cm)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.23

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(H ≥ 185 cm | E) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.23
                   = 0.52

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.52}
