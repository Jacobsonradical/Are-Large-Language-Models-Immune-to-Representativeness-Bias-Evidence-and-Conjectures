To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(E) = Probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80%)
- P(E') = Probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height = 0.2 (20%)
- P(H) = Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
- P(H') = Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85%)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H'))

P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|H') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identified heights shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
