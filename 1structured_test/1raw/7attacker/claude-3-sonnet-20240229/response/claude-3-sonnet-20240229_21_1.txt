To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
