To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the complement of A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

We don't have the value of P(B|A^c), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than that. However, we can calculate it using the given information:

P(B|A^c) = 1 - P(correct identification when shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|A^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
