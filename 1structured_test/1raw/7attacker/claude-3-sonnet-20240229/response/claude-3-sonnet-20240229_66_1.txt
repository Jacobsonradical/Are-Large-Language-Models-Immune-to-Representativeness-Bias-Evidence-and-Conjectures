To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their marginal probabilities.

Given:
- P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from information "a")
- P(Witness identifies correctly | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from information "b")
- P(Witness identifies incorrectly | H < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from information "b")

Let's define the events:
- A: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(B | A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(B | A) = (P(A | B) * P(B)) / P(A)

P(A | B) = P(Witness identifies correctly | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8
P(B) = P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
P(A) = P(A | B) * P(B) + P(A | B') * P(B')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(B | A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
