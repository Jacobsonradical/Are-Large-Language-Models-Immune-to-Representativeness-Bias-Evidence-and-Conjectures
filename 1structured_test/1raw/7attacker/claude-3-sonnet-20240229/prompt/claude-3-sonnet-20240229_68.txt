A person was attacked from behind at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height. Despite this, we have the following two available information:

{
  "a": "85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.",
  "b": "A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases."
}

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller?
