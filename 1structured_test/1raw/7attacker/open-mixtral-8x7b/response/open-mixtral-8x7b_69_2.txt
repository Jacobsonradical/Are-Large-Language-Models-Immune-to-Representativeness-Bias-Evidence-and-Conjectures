To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the observation that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (the witness erred 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm, and correctly identified 80% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.68*0.85 = 0.656

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.656 ≈ 0.1802

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.1802}
