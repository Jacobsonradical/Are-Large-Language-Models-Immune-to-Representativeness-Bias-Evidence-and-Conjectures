To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and when it's not. We'll use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We already know P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15. To find P(E|not H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, we can use the complement: P(E|not H) = 1 - P(not E|not H) = 1 - 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.125 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we just need to find P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.125 * 0.85 ≈ 0.20625

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.20625 ≈ 0.581395

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.5814} (rounded to four decimal places)
