To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- W_Correct: Event that the witness correctly identifies the height.
- W_Incorrect: Event that the witness incorrectly identifies the height.

From the given information, we can calculate:
P(W_Correct|T) = 0.8 and P(W_Incorrect|S) = 0.2.
P(S) = 0.85 and P(T) = 0.15.

We want to calculate P(T|W_Correct), the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W_Correct) = P(W_Correct|T) * P(T) / P(W_Correct)

To find P(W_Correct), we need to find the total probability of the correct identification for both the short and tall groups:

P(W_Correct) = P(W_Correct|T) * P(T) + P(W_Correct|S) * P(S)

However, we don't have P(W_Correct|S), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Since the information provided does not allow us to calculate P(T|W_Correct), we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

I apologize for not being able to provide a specific probability estimate as requested in the format. However, based on the given information, it seems that we cannot accurately calculate the posterior probability.
