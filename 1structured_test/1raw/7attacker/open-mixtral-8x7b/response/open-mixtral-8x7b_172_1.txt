To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem statement, we have:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so 85% is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height in 20% of the cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(¬B), the probability of the witness not identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(¬B) = P(¬B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.03 + 0.68
= 0.71

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to 0.41)

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
