To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the observed evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

First, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability of observing the witness's identification given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(A), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

However, we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm, we can use the witness's error rate of 20%. So P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
