To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller as W.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W)

We want to find P(H|W).

P(W|H) is the accuracy of the witness given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. So, P(W|H) = 0.8.

P(H) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(W). This is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(W|H) and P(W|~H), where ~H represents the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, and the weight is given by the respective probabilities of H and ~H.

P(W|~H) is the complementary probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is indeed shorter than 185 cm, which is 80%. So, P(W|~H) = 0.2.

P(~H) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%. So, P(~H) = 0.85.

Therefore, P(W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] + [P(W|~H) * P(~H)]
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|W) ≈ 0.3448

However, this value is less than 0.5, which doesn't seem to make sense given the information provided. Let's reconsider the problem.

We are given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. This means that when the actual height was 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified it 80% of the time, and when the actual height was shorter than 185 cm, the witness still identified it as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

So, instead of calculating P(W|~H) as the complementary probability, we need to calculate it as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%.

P(W|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can recalculate P(W):

P(W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] + [P(W|~H) * P(~H)]
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|W) ≈ 0.4138

Given the information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
