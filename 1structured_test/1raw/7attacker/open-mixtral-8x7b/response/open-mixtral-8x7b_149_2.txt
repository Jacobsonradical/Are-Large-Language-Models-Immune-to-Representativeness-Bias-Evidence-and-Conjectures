To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new available evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.15 according to the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not. Since the witness is equally likely to make an error in either direction, this probability is also 0.2 (the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

First, we need to calculate P(not A), which is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.17.

Then, we can calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.17)] = 0.3158 or 31.58% when expressed as a percentage.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3158}
