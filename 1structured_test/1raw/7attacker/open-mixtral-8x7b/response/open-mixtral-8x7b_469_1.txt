To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(A|B), we can use the formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(B|A) * P(A):
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
