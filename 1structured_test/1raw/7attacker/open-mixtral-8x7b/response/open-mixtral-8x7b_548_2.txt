To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We're given two pieces of information:

a) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
b) A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such cases.

Let's define the following events:
H = The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W = The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

First, we need to find P(W|H):
- The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller.
- Therefore, P(W|H) = 0.8

Next, we need to find P(H):
- We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- Therefore, P(H) = 0.15

Now, we need to find P(W):
- The probability of the witness saying "185 cm or taller" can be calculated as follows:
  - For people who are 185 cm or taller, the witness will say "185 cm or taller" with a probability of 0.8 (P(W|H)).
  - For people who are shorter than 185 cm, the witness will say "185 cm or taller" with a probability of 0.2 (1 - P(W|H')).
- Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm, we get:
  - P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|H') * P(H')
  - P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
