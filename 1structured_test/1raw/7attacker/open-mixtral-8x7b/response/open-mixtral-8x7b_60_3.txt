To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct (B|A) and the witness is not correct (B|not A). So:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A). We also know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

The witness is not correct 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.145 = 0.265

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.265 = 0.12 / 0.265 â‰ˆ 0.4528

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4528 or 45.28%.
