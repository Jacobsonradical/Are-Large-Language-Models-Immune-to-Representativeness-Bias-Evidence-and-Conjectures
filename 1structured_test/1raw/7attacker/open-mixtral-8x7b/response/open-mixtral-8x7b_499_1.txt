To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm
- P(S): probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm
- P(T): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(B|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
P(B|S) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy)
P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(T|B) = P(B|T) * P(T) / [P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|S) * P(S)]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.17)
= 0.515 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.515}
