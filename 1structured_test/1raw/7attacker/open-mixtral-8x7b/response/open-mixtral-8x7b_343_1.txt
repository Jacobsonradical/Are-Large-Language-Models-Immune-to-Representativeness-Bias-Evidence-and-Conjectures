To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

We know from the given information that:
- The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- The witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|A). This is equal to the witness's accuracy of 80% when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|¬A). This is equal to the witness's error rate of 20% when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

We know the values for P(W|A), P(W|¬A), and P(¬A) (which is 85% since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). However, we don't know the value for P(A). To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(W) / (P(W|A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) / P(A|W))

We don't know the value for P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. However, since the witness has some ability to judge height, it's reasonable to assume that P(W) is greater than 0.5. Let's try using a value of P(W) = 0.6 as an example.

With this value, we can calculate P(A) as follows:

P(A) = 0.6 / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85 / P(A|W))

Solving this equation for P(A), we get a value of approximately 0.32.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.32}
