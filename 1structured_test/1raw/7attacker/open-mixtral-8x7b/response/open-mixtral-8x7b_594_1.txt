To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(E): the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(F): the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
P(A) = ?
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs)
P(¬A) = 0.15 (population distribution)
P(A) = 1 - P(¬A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.85 / 0.71 ≈ 0.896

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.896, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
