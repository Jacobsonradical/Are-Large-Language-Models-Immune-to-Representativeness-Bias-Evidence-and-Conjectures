To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, i.e., the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population. According to the information provided in "a", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height under the given conditions. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the conditional probability P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(¬B|A) = 0.2.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. From the information provided, we know that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2. Since P(¬A) = 0.85 (from "a"), we can calculate the conditional probability P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A) = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
