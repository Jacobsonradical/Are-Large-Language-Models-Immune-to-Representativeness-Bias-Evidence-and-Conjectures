To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|not A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (20%).
- P(not A): The probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343 (34.3%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.343 (34.3%).
