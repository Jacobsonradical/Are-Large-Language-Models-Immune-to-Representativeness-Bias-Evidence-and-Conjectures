To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + [1 - P(not B|not A)] * [1 - 0.15]

From statement (a), we know that the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(not B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.24 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.6857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6857.
