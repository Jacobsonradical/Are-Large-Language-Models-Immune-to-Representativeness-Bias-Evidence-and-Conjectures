To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (A) and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the case where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
