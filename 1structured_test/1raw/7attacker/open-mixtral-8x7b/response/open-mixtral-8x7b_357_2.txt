To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new available evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which from the statement (a) is 15%.
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which from the statement (b) is 80%.
P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which from the statement (b) is 20%.
P(not A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which from the statement (a) is 85%.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the numerator:
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.12 + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
