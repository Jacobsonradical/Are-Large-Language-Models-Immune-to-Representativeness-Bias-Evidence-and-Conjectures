To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): the event where the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(~E): the event where the witness identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A))

We need to find P(E|A) and P(E|~A):

P(E|A) = P(B|A) = 0.8

P(E|~A) = 1 - P(B|~A) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9

Now, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.9 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.765) â‰ˆ 0.136

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.136 (13.6%).
