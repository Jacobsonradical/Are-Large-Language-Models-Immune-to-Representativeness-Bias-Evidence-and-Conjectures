To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as P(A). According to statement "b", the population statistics state that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). 

Now, let's consider the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. We can denote the witness's statement (that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) as W. Then, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is P(W|A) = 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller is P(W|¬A) = 0.2.

We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness made the statement, P(A|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to find P(¬A), which is the probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. Given the population statistics, we know that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can find the probability of the witness's statement, P(W), which is the sum of two probabilities: P(W|A) * P(A) and P(W|¬A) * P(¬A):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is estimated to be approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
