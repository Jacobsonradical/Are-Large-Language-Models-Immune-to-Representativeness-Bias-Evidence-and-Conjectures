To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (shorter than 185 cm)

From the given information, we know:

P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
