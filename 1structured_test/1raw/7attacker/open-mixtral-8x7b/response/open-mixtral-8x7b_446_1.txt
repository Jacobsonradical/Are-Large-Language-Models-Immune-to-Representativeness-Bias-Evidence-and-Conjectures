To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From the given information, we have:
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider both cases where the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and where it is not. Let B be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Given that, P(E|B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time)

Now we can calculate P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4138}.
