To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided, the following probabilities can be calculated:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% of 85% of the population)

Now, Bayes' theorem can be applied:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
â‰ˆ 0.455

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.455}
