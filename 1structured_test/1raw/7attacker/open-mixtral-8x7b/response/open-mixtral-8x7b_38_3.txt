To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. When the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the population statistics. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This means that if we randomly select a person from the city, the probability that they are 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Given the witness's accuracy and the population statistics, we can combine these two probabilities. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the product of the witness's accuracy (0.8) and the population probability (0.15):

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The final answer is:
{probability: 0.12}
