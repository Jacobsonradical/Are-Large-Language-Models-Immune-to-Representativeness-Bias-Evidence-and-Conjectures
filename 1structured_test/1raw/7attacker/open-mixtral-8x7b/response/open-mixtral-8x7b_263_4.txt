To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given their probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A') = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.3448.
