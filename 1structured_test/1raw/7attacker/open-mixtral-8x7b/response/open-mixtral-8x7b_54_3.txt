To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3448

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
