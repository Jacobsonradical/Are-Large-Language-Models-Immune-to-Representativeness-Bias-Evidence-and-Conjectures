To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Let's assume that the attacker is randomly selected from this population.

Next, we have information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Specifically, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using this information, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is simply the witness's accuracy rate of 80%.

However, we are interested in the reverse probability - the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can plug in the values we know:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
* P(A) = 0.15 (population prevalence)
* P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness error rate)
* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plugging these values in, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.14) = 0.403

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.403.
