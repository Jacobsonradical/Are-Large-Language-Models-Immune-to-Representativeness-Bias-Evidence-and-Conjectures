To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's statement and the population statistics to calculate a conditional probability.
The witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the suspect is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the suspect as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population statistics:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is the witness's 80% accuracy rate:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80

The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, is the witness's 20% error rate:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20

The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is a weighted average of these two probabilities, using the base rates of 15% and 85%, respectively:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.321

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.321}.
