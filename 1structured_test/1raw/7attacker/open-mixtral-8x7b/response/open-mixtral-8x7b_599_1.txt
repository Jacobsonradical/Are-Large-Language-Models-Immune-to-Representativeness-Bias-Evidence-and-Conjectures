To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the height (80%).
- P(W|A'): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height (20%).
- P(A'): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (15%).
- P(A'): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (85%).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')]

We have all the values required to calculate the above formula:

P(W|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.15 (since the question asks for the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A') = 0.2
P(A') = 0.85

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.36.
