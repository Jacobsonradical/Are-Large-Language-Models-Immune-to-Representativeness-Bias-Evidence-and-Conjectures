Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy rate when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the witness's error rate when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%.

Now, according to the first piece of information, 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This means that the probability of the attacker being shorter than 1
