To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, we calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85 * 0.8)
= 0.12 + 0.136
= 0.256

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.256
≈ 0.468

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.468.
