To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% according to the information provided. We will use this base rate as our prior probability.

Next, we need to account for the witness's accuracy in judging a person's height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying whether a person is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on this new information.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the problem statement, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). We also know that P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate), which we can use to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not: P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(W|not A) = 0.2, so P(not A|W) = P(W|not A) * P(not A) / P(W) = (0.2 * 0.85) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.17.

Now we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.4545, or approximately 45.45%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4545}
