To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = P(a) * P(A|a) + P(not a) * P(A|not a)
= (0.85 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 1)
= 0.1275 + 0.15
= 0.2775

This is the prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller.

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So,

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
P(not B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies an 185 cm or taller person as shorter)

Likewise, for people shorter than 185 cm,

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)
P(not B|not A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a shorter person as shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.2775] / [(0.8 * 0.2775) + (0.2 * 0.7225)]
â‰ˆ 0.642

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.642.
