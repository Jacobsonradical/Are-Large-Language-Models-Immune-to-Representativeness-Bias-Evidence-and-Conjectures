To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in the city and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's calculate the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller:
P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are:
P(Correct Identification | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.8

Now, we need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the court:
P(Witness Identification of Taller than or equal to 185 cm)

= P(Witness Identification of Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) * P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm)

+ P(Witness Identification of Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.29}
