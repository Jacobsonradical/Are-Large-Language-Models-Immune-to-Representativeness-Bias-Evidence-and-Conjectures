To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4955 or 49.55%

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4955}
