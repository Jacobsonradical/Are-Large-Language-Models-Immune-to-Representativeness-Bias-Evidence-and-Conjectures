To approach this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness's testimony).

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from point a).
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from point b).
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (from point b).
- P(not A) is the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (from point a).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.378 or 37.8%.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.378.
