To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the baseline probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% (or 0.15).

Next, let's account for the witness's reliability. We're told that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that this identification is correct.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 or 80%)
- P(A) is the baseline probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which is a combination of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

First, we need to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345 or 34.5%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 34.5%.
