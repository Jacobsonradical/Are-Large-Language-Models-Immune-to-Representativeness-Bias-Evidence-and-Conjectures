To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are
- P(W|¬A): Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not
- P(¬A): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = ?
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A) = P(W) * P(A|W) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since we don't have information about P(A), we will consider two cases: P(A) = 0.5 and P(A) = 0.85.

Case 1: P(A) = 0.5
- P(W) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.17 * 0.5 = 0.485
- P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.485 ≈ 0.825

Case 2: P(A) = 0.85
- P(W) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.17 * 0.15 ≈ 0.714
- P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.85 / 0.714 ≈ 0.91

Considering both cases, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is somewhere between 0.825 and 0.91. However, since there is a stronger prior probability for a person to be shorter than 185 cm (given that 85% of the population is shorter than that), the lower end of the range seems more reasonable.

Answer: {probability: 0.825}
