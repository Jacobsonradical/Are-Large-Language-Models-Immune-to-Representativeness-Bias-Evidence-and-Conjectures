To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the base rate, which is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller: 15%.

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. When presented with a person who is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies their height 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)

We are given P(witness | 185 cm) = 0.8 and P(185 cm) = 0.15. We can calculate P(witness) by summing over all possible heights:

P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) + P(witness | <185 cm) \* P(<185 cm)

We are given P(witness | 185 cm) = 0.8 and P(185 cm) = 0.15, and we know that P(<185 cm) = 1 - P(185 cm) = 0.85. We are also given that P(witness | <185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

Putting it all together:

P(185 cm | witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

P(185 cm | witness) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)

P(185 cm | witness) = 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 36%.
