To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the reliability of the witness's identification.

1. The base rate is given as 15% (or 0.15) in the city.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here,
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 1
