To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A' ) as the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B' | A' ) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 1
