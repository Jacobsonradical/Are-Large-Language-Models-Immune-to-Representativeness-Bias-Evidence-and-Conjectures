To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

Our goal is to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information about the population and the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the given data.
- P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the given data.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.8 based on the given data.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on the given data (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate:
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
- P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
- P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = (P(B and A) + P(B and not A)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Given the problem's constraints, our final answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
