To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(A|B) is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.375}
