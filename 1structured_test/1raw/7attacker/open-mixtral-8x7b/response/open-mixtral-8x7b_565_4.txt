To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness mistakenly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using the Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

After calculating, we get:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4359

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.44 (rounded), confidence: 0.95}
