To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the true height is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can now calculate P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ not A)
P(B ∩ A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B ∩ not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1445
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1445 ≈ 0.2645

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2645 ≈ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
