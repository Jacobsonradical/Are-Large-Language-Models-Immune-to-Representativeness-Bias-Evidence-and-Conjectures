To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 1
