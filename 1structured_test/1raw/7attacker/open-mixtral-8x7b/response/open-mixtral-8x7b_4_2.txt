To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given that event B occurred (the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to compute P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
- Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are wrong 20% of the time: P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now we can compute P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 (18%)

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.667 (66.7%)

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
