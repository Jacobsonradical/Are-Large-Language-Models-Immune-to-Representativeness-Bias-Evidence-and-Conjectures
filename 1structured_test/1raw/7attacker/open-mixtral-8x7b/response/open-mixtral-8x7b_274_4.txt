To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new available evidence. 

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the information given.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is indeed 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 0.8 according to the information given.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is not 185 cm or taller is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, which is 0.2 (1-0.8) since the witness errs 20% of the time.
- P(not A) is the probability that a random person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 according to the information given.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the above values into the formula, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17) = 0.09 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.346.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.346.
