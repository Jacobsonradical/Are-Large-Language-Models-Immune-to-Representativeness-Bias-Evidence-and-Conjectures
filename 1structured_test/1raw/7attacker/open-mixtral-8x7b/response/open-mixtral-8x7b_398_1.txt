To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies incorrectly | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given information:
P(witness identifies correctly) = 0.8
P(witness identifies incorrectly) = 0.2
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (based on 15% of the population)
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (based on 85% of the population)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= [P(witness identifies correctly | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / ([0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85])
â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2818}
