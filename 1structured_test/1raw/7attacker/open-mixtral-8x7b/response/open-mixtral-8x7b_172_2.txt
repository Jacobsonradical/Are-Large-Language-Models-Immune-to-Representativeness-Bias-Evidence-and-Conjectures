To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is shorter than 185 cm is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, which is 0.2 according to the given information.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* (1-P(A)))

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.9091

So our estimate is that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.9091.
