To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.50 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the true height is shorter than 185 cm, effectively randomly guessing)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Calculating the terms:
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.50) * (0.85) = 0.425

Substituting into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [(0.80) * (0.15)] / {[(0.80) * (0.15)] + [0.425]} ≈ 0.2245

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2245 or 22.45%.
