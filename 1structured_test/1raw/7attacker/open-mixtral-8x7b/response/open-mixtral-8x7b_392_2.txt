To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = P(the witness identifies the attacker incorrectly as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 20% = 0.2 (¬A denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
