To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. From the given information, we have:

P(A) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B|not A) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2
P(not A) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2766

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2766}
