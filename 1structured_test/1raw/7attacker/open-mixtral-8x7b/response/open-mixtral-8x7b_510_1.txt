To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. 

We have:
- P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) * P(person is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is shorter than 185 cm) * P(person is shorter than 185 cm)

We are given:
- P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness is correct)
- P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness errs)
- P(person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the probability:
P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

My estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.29}
