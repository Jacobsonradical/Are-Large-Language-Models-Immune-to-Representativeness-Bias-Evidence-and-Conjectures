To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided, we have:
P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (the witness always identifies the correct height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4688

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4688 or 46.88%.
