To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement and their ability to judge a person's height.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. The attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, so we have to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W = Witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
~W = Witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From the problem, P(A) is unknown, P(W|A) = 0.8, and P(~W|A) = 0.2.

We want to find P(A|W) = P(W and A) / P(W)

Using the formula for conditional probability, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and ~A)

We are given that the city population is 85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's evaluation is based on half of the people being shorter than 185 cm and half being 185 cm or taller, we can adjust the probabilities accordingly:

P(A) = 0.5 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Now we need to calculate P(W and A) and P(W and ~A):

P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4
P(W and ~A) = P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and ~A) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W and A) / P(W) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
