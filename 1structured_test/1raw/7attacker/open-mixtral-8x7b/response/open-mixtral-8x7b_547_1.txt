To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 when they indeed are that tall, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and the case where they are not. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From statement (a), we know that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 when they are not, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(not A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.4138.
