To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (prior probability)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (sensitivity or true positive rate)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (false positive rate)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then we calculate P(¬B|¬A), the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is a false positive):

P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.68)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(A|B) = 0.15

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.
