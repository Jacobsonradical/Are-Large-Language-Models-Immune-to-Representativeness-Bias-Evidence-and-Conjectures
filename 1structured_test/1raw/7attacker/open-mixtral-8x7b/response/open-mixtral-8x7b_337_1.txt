To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 0.85 probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. Since half of the people in the witness's sample are 185 cm or taller, there's a 0.5 probability that a randomly chosen person from this sample is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. We can use this information to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Let's plug in the values:
P(Witness identified correctly) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5
P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified incorrectly) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.68

Now, we can find the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.68 = 0.609 (60.9%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.609}.
