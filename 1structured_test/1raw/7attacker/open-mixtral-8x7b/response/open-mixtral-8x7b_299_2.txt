To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's compute P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by considering the two possible cases for the attacker's height, A and not A, and calculating the probability that the witness identifies them as 185 cm or taller in each case:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (or 29%)

Now we can compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345 (or 34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
