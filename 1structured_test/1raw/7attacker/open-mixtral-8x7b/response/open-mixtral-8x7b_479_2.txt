To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's state our prior belief about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, based on the information "a":
P(tall) = 15% or 0.15

Next, let's introduce the witness's evidence, which is that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. According to the witness, this occurs with a probability of 80% when the actual height is indeed 185 cm or taller. But the witness makes mistakes, and incorrectly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. We denote these probabilities as:
P(witness_tall|tall) = 80% or 0.8
P(witness_tall|short) = 20% or 0.2

What we want to find is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, which is denoted as:
P(tall|witness_tall)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(tall|witness_tall) = P(witness_tall|tall) * P(tall) / P(witness_tall)

We can calculate the denominator P(witness_tall) using the law of total probability:
P(witness_tall) = P(witness_tall|tall) * P(tall) + P(witness_tall|short) * P(short)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find our desired probability:
P(tall|witness_tall) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.345 or 34.5%

So, given the available information, there's approximately a 34.5% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
