To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics from the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(W): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W'): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B'|A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W') = 1 - P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We want to calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)

First, let's compute P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (P(B|A') * 0.85)

However, we don't have P(B|A'), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the person is shorter. Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|A'), we cannot provide an exact answer.

If we assume that the witness will never identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller (which might not be true but helps us to estimate the probability), we can calculate the upper bound of P(A):

In this case, P(B|A') = 0 and P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Then,

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.12 / 0.15)
     = 0.9 (rounded to one decimal place)

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at most 0.9, but this assumes that the witness never makes a mistake in identifying shorter people as 185 cm or taller.

Answer: {probability: 0.9}
