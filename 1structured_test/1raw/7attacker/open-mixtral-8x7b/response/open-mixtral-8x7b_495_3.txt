To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 80% of people who are 185 cm or taller)

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Denote C as the complementary event of A, i.e., "the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm". Then, we are given P(B|C) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies 20% of people who are shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To compute P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|C) * P(C)

So,
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
