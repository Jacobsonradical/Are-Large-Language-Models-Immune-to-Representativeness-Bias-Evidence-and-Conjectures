To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know:
P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% or 0.15
P(B|A): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such = 80% or 0.8

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. This is calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such, and the probability that the person is not 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifies them as such.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the circumstances, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
