To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) + P(not A) = 1
P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) / [0.8 * (1 - 0.15) + 0.03 * 0.15]

Calculating P(A|B):

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.9524

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9524}
