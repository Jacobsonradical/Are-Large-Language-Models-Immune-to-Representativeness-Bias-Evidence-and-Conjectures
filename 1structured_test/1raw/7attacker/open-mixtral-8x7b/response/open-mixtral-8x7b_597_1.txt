To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- D: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|D), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the fact that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D)

First, let's find P(D|H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are actually 185 cm or taller, P(D|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(H): the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(D), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller for both cases: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(D) = P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H)

We already know P(D|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15. We need to find P(D|~H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, P(D|~H) = 0.2. And since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(~H) = 0.85.

So, P(D) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|D):

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

{probability: 0.343}
