To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "15% are 185 cm or taller". So, P(T) = 0.15, where T denotes the event that a random person is 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (i.e., identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time. So, P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|not T) = 0.2, where W denotes the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|not T) \* P(not T)]

= (0.8) \* (0.15) / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)]

= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

= 0.12 / 0.29

= 0.41379310344827587 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
