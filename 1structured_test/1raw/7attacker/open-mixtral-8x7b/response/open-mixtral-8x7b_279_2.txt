To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In our case, the events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:
P(A|W) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|W) ≈ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4535 (or 45.35%).
