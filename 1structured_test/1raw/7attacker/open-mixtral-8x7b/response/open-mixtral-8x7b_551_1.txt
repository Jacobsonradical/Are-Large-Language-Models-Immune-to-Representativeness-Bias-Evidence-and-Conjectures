To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as such by the witness (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (8.5% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them, and the probability that the person is not 185 cm or taller but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
