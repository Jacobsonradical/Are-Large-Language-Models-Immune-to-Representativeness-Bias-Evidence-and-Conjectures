To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

First, let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to calculate P(A), given the information provided.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that P(Correctly identified | A) = 0.8 and P(Erroneously identified | not A) = 0.2.

We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, or P(not A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A | Correctly identified) as:

P(A | Correctly identified) = P(Correctly identified | A) \* P(A) / P(Correctly identified)

We can simplify this equation by noting that P(Correctly identified) = P(Correctly identified | A) \* P(A) + P(Correctly identified | not A) \* P(not A), which gives us:

P(A | Correctly identified) = 0.8 \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Since we want to estimate P(A), we can solve this equation for P(A) assuming that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height. This gives us:

P(A) = 0.85 / (0.85 + 0.2 \* 0.8 / 0.8) = 0.85 / (0.85 + 0.2 \* 0.2) = 0.85 / 0.91

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9341, explanation: This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.}
