To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in two steps. First, we use the city's population statistics to find the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller. Then, we adjust this probability using the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Step 1 - Probability based on city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Step 2 - Accounting for the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller AND the person actually being 185 cm or taller, and the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller but the person not actually being 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A')
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
