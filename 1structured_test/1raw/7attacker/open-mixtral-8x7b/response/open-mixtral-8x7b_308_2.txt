To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the information provided (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.685 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.685 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.5805
= 0.7005

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.7005
â‰ˆ 0.1627

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1627 or 16.27%.
