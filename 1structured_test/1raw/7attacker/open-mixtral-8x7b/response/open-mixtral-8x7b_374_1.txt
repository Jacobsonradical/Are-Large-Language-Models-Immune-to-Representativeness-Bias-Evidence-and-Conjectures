To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (E). In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the observed evidence (E) is the witness's statement.

First, let's define our terms:
- P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population statistics.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2.
- P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the city's population statistics.
- P(~E|~H) is the probability that the witness does NOT identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(~E|~H) = 1 - P(E|~H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.6

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6 (or 60%).
