To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and since 85% of the population is not 185 cm tall, we multiply these two percentages)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.43.
