To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4286

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4286 or 42.86%.
