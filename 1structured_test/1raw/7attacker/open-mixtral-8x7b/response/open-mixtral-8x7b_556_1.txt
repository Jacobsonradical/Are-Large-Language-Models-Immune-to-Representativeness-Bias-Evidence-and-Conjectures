To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% probability) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we need to consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85. Now, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm (an error). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
