To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

We know that the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is a piece of evidence that we can use to update our initial belief. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller, and erroneous 20% of the time.

The distribution of heights in the city's population is also relevant information. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|Witness) = P(Witness|A) \* P(A) / P(Witness)

We want to calculate P(A|Witness), so let's simplify this equation by calculating the other terms separately.

First, P(Witness|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

Next, P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to calculate.

Finally, P(Witness) is the probability that the witness makes the statement about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(Witness) = P(Witness|A) \* P(A) + P(Witness|not A) \* P(not A)

We know that P(Witness|A) is 0.8 (80%), and P(Witness|not A) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when it is not, which is 0.2 (20%). We also know that P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Therefore, P(Witness) can be calculated as:

P(Witness) = (0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A))

Now, we can calculate P(A|Witness) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|Witness) = (0.8) \* P(A) / ((0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A)))

We want to solve for P(A), so let's rearrange this equation:

P(A) = P(A|Witness) \* ((0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A))) / 0.8

We don't know P(A|Witness) yet, but we can express it in terms of P(A) and the other known probabilities. From the witness's statement, we know that the witness identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, so:

P(A|Witness) = 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(A))

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:

P(A) = (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(A))) \* ((0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A))) / (0.64 \* P(A))

Multiplying out the terms in the numerator, we get:

P(A) = 0.64 \* P(A)^2 + 0.16 \* P(A) + 0.16 \* (1 - P(A))

Simplifying, we get:

0.36 \* P(A)^2 - 0.08 \* P(A) + 0.16 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in P(A). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:

P(A) = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a = 0.36, b = -0.08, and c = 0.16.

The positive root of this equation is:

P(A) = (0.08 + sqrt(0.0064 - 0.576)) / 0.72

Simplifying, we get:

P(A) ≈ 0.24

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.24}
