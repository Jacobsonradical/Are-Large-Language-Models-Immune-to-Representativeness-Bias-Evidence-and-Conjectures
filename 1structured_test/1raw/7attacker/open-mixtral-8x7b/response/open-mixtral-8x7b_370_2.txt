To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (from b)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the case where they are not. Let's denote ~A as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A).

From the problem, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(~A) = 0.85. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, they are wrong 20% of the time, i.e., P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
