To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the total population of the city. According to the information given, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Let's assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population.

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs (identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A), and when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (event A').

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, so we just need to calculate P(B|A') and P(A').

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person's height, so:

P(B|A') = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
