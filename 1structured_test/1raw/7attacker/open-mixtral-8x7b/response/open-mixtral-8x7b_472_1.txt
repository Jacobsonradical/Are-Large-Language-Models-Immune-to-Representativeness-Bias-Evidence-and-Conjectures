To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to find P(¬A), which is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
