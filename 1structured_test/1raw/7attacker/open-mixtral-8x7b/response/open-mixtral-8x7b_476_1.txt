To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information provided, we know:
P(A): Probability that an individual is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. To find this, we need to consider both the case where the individual is actually 185 cm or taller and the case where they are not.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

We don't know P(B|not A), the false positive rate, but we can calculate it using the witness's error rate. The error rate means that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. So, the false positive rate is:

P(B|not A) = Error rate = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
