To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, which means the false positive rate is 20%, and the false negative rate is also 20%.
2. In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define our terms:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in estimating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate:

- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the given data, P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness falsely identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2
- P(¬A): The prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A), so P(¬A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using the formula:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the known probabilities:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
