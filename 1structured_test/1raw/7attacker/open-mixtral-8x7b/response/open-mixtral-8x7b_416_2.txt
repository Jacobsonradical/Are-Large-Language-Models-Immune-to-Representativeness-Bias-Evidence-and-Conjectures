To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information, P(A) = 0.15 and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time). We also need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness errs 20% of the time in this case, we have P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.203.

Finally, we can find the desired probability using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.203 â‰ˆ 0.59.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.59}
