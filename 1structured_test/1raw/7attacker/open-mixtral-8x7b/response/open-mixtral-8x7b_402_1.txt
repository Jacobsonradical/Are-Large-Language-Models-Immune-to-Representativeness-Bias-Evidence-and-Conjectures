To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population. We will use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We have the following probabilities from the information provided:

P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (based on the city's population distribution)
P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (based on the witness's ability to correctly identify tall people)
P(B'|A) = 20% or 0.2 (based on the witness's error rate for tall people)
P(B|A') = 15% (since 15% of people are 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time for short people)
P(B'|A') = 85% (since 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and the witness is correct 80% of the time for short people)

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.1275 = 0.3075

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3075 = 0.12 or 12%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
