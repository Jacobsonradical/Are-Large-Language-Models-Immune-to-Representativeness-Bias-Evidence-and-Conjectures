Let's reason through this problem:

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

The witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and we want to estimate the probability that this is true.

To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.16 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.16 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.136
     = 0.256

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.256
      = 0.12 / 0.256
      = 0.46875

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.46875}
