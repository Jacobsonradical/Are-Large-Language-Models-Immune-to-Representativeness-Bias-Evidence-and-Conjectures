To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Rearranging to solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A|B) / P(B)

Plugging in the given values:

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.8 / 0.15
P(A) = 0.64 / 0.15
P(A) = 4.27 (approximately)

However, P(A) should be between 0 and 1, so we need to normalize this value by dividing it by the sum of P(A) and P(not A) to ensure that it falls within the valid range:

P(A) = 4.27 / (4.27 + 1)
P(A) â‰ˆ 0.81 (approximately)

So, our estimate is that there is an 81% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
