To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
