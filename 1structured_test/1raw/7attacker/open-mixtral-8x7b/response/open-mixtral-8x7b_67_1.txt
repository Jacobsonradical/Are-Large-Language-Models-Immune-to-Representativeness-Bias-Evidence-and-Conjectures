To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17]
â‰ˆ 0.315

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.315.
