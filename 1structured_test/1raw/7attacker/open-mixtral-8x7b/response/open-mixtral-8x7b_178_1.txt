To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. When the witness thinks a person is 185 cm or taller, they are correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time. Since the population is split evenly between people shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the witness is correct as follows:

Correct identification = 0.5 (population portion) * 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.4

Similarly, the probability that the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller is:

Incorrect identification = 0.5 (population portion) * 0.2 (probability of incorrect identification) = 0.1

Now, let's incorporate the population statistics. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Finally, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = Correct identification + Incorrect identification

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.4 + 0.15

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.55

Given the witness's testimony, and population statistics, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.55 or 55%.
