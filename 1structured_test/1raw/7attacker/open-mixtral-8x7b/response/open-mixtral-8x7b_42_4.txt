To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A)) = 80% = 0.8 (from b)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
