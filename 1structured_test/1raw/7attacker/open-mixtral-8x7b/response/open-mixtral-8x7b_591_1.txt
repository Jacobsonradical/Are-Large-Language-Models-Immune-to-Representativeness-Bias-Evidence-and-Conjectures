To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)) is 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not (P(B|not A)) is 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (P(A)) and 85% is not (P(not A)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
