To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "A" (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and "B" (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller). 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B|not A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%). This is calculated as the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is the complement of the witness correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B): This is what we want to find. It's the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 41%.
