To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.50 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the true height is shorter than 185 cm, so the remaining 80% is split evenly between "tall" and "short" identifications)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.50 * 0.85 = 0.425

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.425)] ≈ 0.2568

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 25.68%.
