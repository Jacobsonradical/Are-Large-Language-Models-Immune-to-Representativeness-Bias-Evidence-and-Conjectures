To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define some terms:

- Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the observed evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence.

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:

1. P(H) = 15% = 0.15 (from statement a)
2. P(D|H) = 80% = 0.8 (from statement b)
3. P(~H) = 85% = 0.85 (from statement a, where ~H represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
4. P(D|~H) = 20% = 0.2 (from statement b, this is the error rate when the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, but they are actually not)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|D):

P(H|D) = (P(D|H) * P(H)) / (P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the values:

P(H|D) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives:

P(H|D) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the observed evidence, is approximately 0.36.
