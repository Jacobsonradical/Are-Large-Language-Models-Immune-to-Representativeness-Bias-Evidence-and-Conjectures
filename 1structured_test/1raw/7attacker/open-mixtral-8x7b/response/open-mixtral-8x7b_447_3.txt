To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H and the probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm as L.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. According to statement (b), 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(A|H). The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are actually 185 cm or taller, so P(A|H) = 0.8.

We also need to find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(A|L). The witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, so P(A|L) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(H|A):

P(H|A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) / [P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|L) \* P(L)]

We know that P(H) = 0.15, P(A|H) = 0.8, and P(A|L) = 0.2. We also know that P(L) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. Plugging these values in, we get:

P(H|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P(H|A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|A) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|A) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
