To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that they were identified as such by the witness (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A)) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone who is actually 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone who is not 185 cm or taller as such.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + P(B|not A) * (1-0.15)

We are also given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness errs 20% of the time when judging height. So, the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is:

P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2

Substituting these values into our expression for P(B):

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.345}
