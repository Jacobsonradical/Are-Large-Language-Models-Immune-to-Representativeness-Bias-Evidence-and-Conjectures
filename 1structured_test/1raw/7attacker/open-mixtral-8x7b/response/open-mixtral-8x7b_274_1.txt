To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 based on the information)
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter (which is 0.2 based on the information)
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85 based on the information)

We want to find P(A) given the evidence. We'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

Now, let's calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Here, we know all the terms:

- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(¬A) = P(the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:

P(W) = 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85

Now, let's solve for P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85)

We are interested in estimating P(A), so let's find the range of possible values for P(A) given the constraint that P(A|W) should be between 0 and 1.

First, notice that P(W|A) \* P(A) must be less than or equal to 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85, so:

P(A) <= (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85) / P(W|A)

Using the values of P(W|A), we get:

P(A) <= 0.8375 / 0.8

Solving for P(A):

P(A) <= 1.046875

Since P(A) must be less than or equal to 1, this condition is satisfied. However, we need to ensure that P(A|W) is greater than or equal to 0.

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.85) >= 0

Solving for P(A):

P(A) >= 0.17

Combining both constraints, we get:

0.17 <= P(A) <= 1.046875

However, since P(A) must be between 0 and 1, we take the closest possible integer value:

P(A) = 0.17 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.17.
