To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller).

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to find P(A), so we rearrange the formula:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.15

To solve for P(A), we can divide both sides by 0.8:

P(A) = P(A) / 0.15 / 0.8

Now, we can multiply both sides by 0.15 * 0.8:

P(A) = 0.12 * P(A)

We can subtract 0.12 * P(A) from both sides:

P(A) - 0.12 * P(A) = 0

Now, we can factor P(A) out of the left side:

P(A) * (1 - 0.12) = 0

Now, we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = 0 / (1 - 0.12)
P(A) = 0 / 0.88
P(A) â‰ˆ 0

There is not enough information to determine the exact probability, but based on the given data, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is very close to 0.

Answer: {probability: 0}
