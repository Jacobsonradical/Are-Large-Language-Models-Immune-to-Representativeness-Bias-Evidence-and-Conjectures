To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.5 (when the person is not 185 cm or taller, the witness has an equal chance of making an error or being correct)

Now, we can find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.545 ≈ 0.216

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.216.
