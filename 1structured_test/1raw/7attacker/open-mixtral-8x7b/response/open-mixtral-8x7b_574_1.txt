To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A), given the information in a and b.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller. We are given that this probability is 0.8 or 80%.

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. We are given that this probability is 0.2 or 20%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A), given the information in a and b.

P(A) = P(A|witness identifies 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) + P(A|witness identifies shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm)

We are given that the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 or 85%.

Using the witness's abilities, the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | A) * P(A) + P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | not A) * P(not A)

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35 or 35%

Similarly, the probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm is:

P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm) = P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm | A) * P(A) + P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm | not A) * P(not A)

P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 or 71%

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = P(A|witness identifies 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) + P(A|witness identifies shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness identifies shorter than 185 cm)

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 29%.

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
