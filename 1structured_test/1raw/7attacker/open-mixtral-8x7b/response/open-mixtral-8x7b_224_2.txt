To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, i.e., P(B|A) = 0.8. Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, i.e., P(¬B|A) = 0.2. Since the witness's identification is binary (either 185 cm or taller, or shorter), we have P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, where ¬A denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From statement (b), we know that the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city's population is 15%, i.e., P(A) = 0.15. Since the complementary probability of being shorter than 185 cm is 85%, we have P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. To do this, we need to calculate P(B), the marginal probability of the observed evidence, which is the sum of probabilities of observing the evidence under each hypothesis:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
