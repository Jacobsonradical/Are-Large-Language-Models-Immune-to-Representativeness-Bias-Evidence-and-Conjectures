To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E)

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:
P(E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|~A) \* P(~A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
~ 0.4138

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
