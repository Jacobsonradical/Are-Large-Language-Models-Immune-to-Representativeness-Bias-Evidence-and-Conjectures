To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness identified them as such
- P(~E): probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller and the witness identified them as such

We are given that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).

We also know that P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller).

Now we need to calculate P(E) and P(~E) to estimate P(A).

P(E) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(~E) = P(~A) * P(B|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Finally, we can estimate P(A) as:
P(A) = P(E) / (P(E) + P(~E)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
