To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We just need to be careful about which events are conditioned on what.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- C: The witness identifies a randomly chosen person as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(C|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the true height is shorter than 185 cm)

Note that P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) and we can use the fact that P(C|¬A) = 0.20 to find P(C|A), since the probabilities of the witness's identification sum to 1:

P(C|A) = 1 - P(C|¬A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(C|¬A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.68
     = 0.80

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.80
      = 0.15 / 1
      = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is:

{probability: 0.15}
