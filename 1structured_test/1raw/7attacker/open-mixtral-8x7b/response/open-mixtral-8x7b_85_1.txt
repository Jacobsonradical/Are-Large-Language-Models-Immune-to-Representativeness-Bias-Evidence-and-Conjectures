To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (80% if the person is actually 185 cm or taller, or 20% if the person is not)
- P(A|B): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such (we want to find this)

We want to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
