To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

We are given that P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2. To find P(not A), we can use the fact that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
