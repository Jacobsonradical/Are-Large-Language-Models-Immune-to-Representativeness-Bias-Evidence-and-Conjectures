To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in a meaningful way.

First, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

Next, we have information about the reliability of the witness. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if a person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. This is our likelihood.

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness)

We are given P(185 cm) = 0.15, and P(witness | 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate). We need to find P(witness), which is the probability of the witness's statement regardless of the attacker's height.

P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(witness | <185 cm) * P(<185 cm)

The probability of the witness's statement given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is the complement of the witness's correct identification rate, which is 0.2 (the error rate). We are also given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(<185 cm) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(185 cm | witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, after considering the witness's statement, there is approximately a 41% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
