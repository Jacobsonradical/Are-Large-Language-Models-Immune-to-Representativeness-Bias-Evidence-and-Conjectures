To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller (80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller (20%, because the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) as the probability that a random person in the city is not 185 cm or taller (100% - 15% = 85%)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

First, we need to calculate P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by calculating the weighted sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) using their respective probabilities P(A) and P(not A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
