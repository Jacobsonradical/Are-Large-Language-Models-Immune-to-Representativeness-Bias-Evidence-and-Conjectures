To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is not 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now, we have all the values to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.14)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4038

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 40.38%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.4038}
