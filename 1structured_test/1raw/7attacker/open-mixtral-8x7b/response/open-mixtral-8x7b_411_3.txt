To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
