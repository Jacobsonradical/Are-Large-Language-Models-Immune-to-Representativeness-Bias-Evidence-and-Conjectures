To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = P(185 cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15 (from part b)
P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, from part a)
P(A') = P(shorter than 185 cm) = 85% or 0.85 (from part b)
P(B|A') = 20% or 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, 20% of the time, from part a)

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

First, we need to find P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138 or 41.38%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 41.38%.
