To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(w|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(w|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height (when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
P(A|w) = 0.8 (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A|w) = 0.2 (probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = 0.15 (population proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B) = 0.85 (population proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A) = ?

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(w|A) * P(A) / P(w)

First, we need to find P(w):
P(w) = P(w|A) * P(A) + P(w|¬A) * P(¬A)

Now, we don't have direct information about P(w|A) and P(w|¬A). However, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height to determine them.

P(w|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person was indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(¬w|¬A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the person as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time)

Now, we can find P(w|¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.15
P(¬w|¬A) = 1 - P(w|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since we're considering the case where the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to find P(w|¬A):
P(w|¬A) = 1 - P(¬w|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(w):
P(w) = P(w|A) * P(A) + P(w|¬A) * P(¬A) = 1 * P(A) + 0.8 * 0.15

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A):
P(A) = P(w|A) * P(A) / P(w)

Solving for P(A), we get:
P(A) = (P(w|A) * P(A)) / (P(w|A) * P(A) + P(w|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A) = (1 * P(A)) / (1 * P(A) + 0.8 * 0.15)

We know that P(A) + P(¬A) = 1, so P(A) = 1 - P(¬A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can plug the value of P(A) into the above equation:
P(A) = (1 * 0.85) / (1 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15)
P(A) = 0.85 / (0.85 + 0.12)
P(A) = 0.85 / 0.97

Based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8763 or 87.63%.
