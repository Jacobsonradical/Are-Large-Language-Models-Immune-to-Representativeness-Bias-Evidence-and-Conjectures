To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(¬B|A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm.
- P(¬B) as the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we know that P(B) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(¬B) = 0.85. Since the witness is equally likely to make an error in both directions, P(¬B|A) = P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A), we can rewrite this as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(B|¬A)) * (1 - P(A)))

We don't know the exact value of P(A), but we can find the range of possible values. Since the witness made an error, either the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm (and thus the witness incorrectly identified them as taller), or the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. Let's call these two possibilities E1 and E2:

E1: P(A) = 0 (meaning the attacker is always shorter than 185 cm)
E2: P(A) = 1 (meaning the attacker is always 185 cm or taller)

Let's calculate P(A|B) for each of these possibilities:

E1: P(A) = 0, P(A|B) = 0
E2: P(A) = 1, P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.8 * (1 / (1 + 0.175)) ≈ 0.696

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 0.696.
