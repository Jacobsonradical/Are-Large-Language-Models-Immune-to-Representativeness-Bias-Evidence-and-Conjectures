To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the question, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A'). Then:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
