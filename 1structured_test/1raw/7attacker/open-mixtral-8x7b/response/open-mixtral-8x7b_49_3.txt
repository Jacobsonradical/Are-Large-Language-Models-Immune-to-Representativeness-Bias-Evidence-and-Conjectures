To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as such by a witness (B).

First, let's find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller. According to statement a, 15% of the population meets this condition.

Next, we need to find the probability of identifying someone correctly as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the true positive rate, or sensitivity, of the witness, and it's given as 80% in statement b. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to find the probability of identifying someone correctly as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are indeed shorter than 185 cm. This is the true negative rate, or specificity, of the witness. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the true negative rate is 80% of 50%, or 40%. So, P(¬B|¬A) = 0.4.

Since the events A and ¬A are complementary, and the witness can only make two types of errors (identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, or identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are not), it follows that the false positive rate, P(B|¬A), is also 20% of 50%, or 0.1.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values we found:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)

Calculating the above expression gives us approximately 0.5556, or 55.56% as the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

So, {probability: 0.5556}
