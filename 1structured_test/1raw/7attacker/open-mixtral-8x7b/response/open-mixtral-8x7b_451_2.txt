To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate, or the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Next, let's take into account the witness's ability to identify a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Therefore, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:

* A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* P(A) is the base rate, or the probability of A, which is 15% or 0.15
* P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the witness's accuracy when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8
* P(B) is the probability of B, which is the sum of P(B|A) \* P(A) and P(B|not A) \* P(not A), where P(not A) is the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85, and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the witness's error rate when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
