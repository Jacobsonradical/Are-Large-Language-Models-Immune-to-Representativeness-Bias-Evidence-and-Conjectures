To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (80%) and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population (15%).

Let's define the following events:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time: P(B|A) = 0.8

Next, let's find P(A), the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller: P(A) = 0.15

Now, let's find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|¬A) * P(¬A), where ¬A is the complementary event of A (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm), P(¬A) = 1 - P(A), and P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (20% error rate).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
