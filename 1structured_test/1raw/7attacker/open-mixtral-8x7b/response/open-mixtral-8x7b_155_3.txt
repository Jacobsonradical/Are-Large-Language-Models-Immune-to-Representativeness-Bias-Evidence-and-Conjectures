To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(Correct|185+): probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(Correct|<185): probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(185+): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(<185): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We know from the problem statement that:
P(Correct|185+) = 0.8
P(Correct|<185) = 0.2
P(<185) = 0.85

Since P(185+) = 1 - P(<185), we have P(185+) = 0.15

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To compute P(B), we need to find the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate this as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller in the two possible cases:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|<A) * P(<A)
P(B|<A) = 1 - P(Correct|<185) = 0.8

Therefore:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.68

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.2206

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.2206}.
