To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

From the given information, we know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identified a person's height as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, we can use this information to update our initial belief.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the problem statement, we are given that P(A) = 0.15.

However, we also have information about the witness's ability to identify the attacker's height. We are told that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying whether a person is 185 cm or taller (event B). This means that P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we are missing information about P(B|A'), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. We are given that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time. Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness has a 50% chance of encountering a person who is shorter than 185 cm. Thus, we can calculate P(B|A') as follows:

P(B|A') = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can find P(B) by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the values we have calculated:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.13

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.13 â‰ˆ 0.9231

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9231}
