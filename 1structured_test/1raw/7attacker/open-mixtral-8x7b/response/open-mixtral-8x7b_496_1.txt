To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of that event given each of the mutually exclusive scenarios.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|not A), we consider that the witness makes an error 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%.
