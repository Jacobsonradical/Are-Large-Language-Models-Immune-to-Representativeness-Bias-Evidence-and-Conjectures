To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial probability (prior) based on new evidence (likelihood).

First, let's define our terms:

- Prior: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's testimony. This is given by statement (a) and can be calculated as 15% (0.15).
- Likelihood: The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the actual height of the attacker. This is given by statement (b) and can be calculated as 80% (0.8) if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 20% (0.2) if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Posterior: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller after considering the witness's testimony.

Now, let's calculate the posterior. We'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

However, we don't know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To calculate this, we need to consider two cases:

- Case 1: The attacker is 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness will identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 80%.
- Case 2: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 20%.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of Case 2 is 0.85, and the probability of Case 1 is 0.15.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|Case 1) * P(Case 1) + P(B|Case 2) * P(Case 2)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, after considering the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
