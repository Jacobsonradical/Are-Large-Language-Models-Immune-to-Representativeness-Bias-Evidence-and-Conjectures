Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
2. This also means that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the city's population:

1. 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the witness's identification is dependent on the actual height of the person, we can multiply these probabilities to get the overall estimate. 

The final estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, {probability: 0.29}
