To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the observed evidence: the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of event A given the observed evidence B.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's compute the terms:

P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 80% or 0.8 based on the given information.

P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This probability is 15% or 0.15 based on the given information.

P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To compute P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies the height (probability: 0.15 * 0.8).
2. The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly identifies the height (probability: 0.85 * 0.2).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A represents the opposite of A, the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can compute P(B):

P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
