To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the observed evidence, which is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15.
We also know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm. Since the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1445
P(B) = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.2645
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) = 0.4538 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4538}.
