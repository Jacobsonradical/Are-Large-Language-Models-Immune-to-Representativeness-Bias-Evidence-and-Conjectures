To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.17 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.1445

Then, apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1445) ≈ 0.5309

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.5309 or 53.09%.
