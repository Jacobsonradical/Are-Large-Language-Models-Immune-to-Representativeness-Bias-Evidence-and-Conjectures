To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
A - event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B - event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
P(B|A) - the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) - the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) according to point a.
P(B) - the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To compute P(B), we need to consider two sub-cases: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies him as such with probability P(B|A) = 0.8. The other sub-case is when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness mistakenly identifies him as 185 cm or taller with probability 1 - P(B|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%). Here, A' denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The total probability P(B) is the sum of probabilities of these two sub-cases:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(B|A')) * P(A')

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), and we can compute P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute the probability that we are interested in, P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Format answer: {probability: 0.345}
