To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W = The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 and errs with a probability of 0.2. That is, P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W'|A) = 0.2 where W' is the complementary event of W. Similarly, we are told that the probability of the witness identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2, so P(W|A') = 0.2 and P(W'|A') = 0.8 where A' is the complementary event of A.

From statement (b), we know that the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85.

What we want to find is P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.345}
