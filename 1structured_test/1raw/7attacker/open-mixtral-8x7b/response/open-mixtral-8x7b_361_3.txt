To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 20% = 0.2 (¬A is the complementary event of A)

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then, calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
