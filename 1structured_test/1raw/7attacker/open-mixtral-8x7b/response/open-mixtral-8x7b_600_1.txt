To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.15 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.15)*(1-0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.13075
= 0.25075

Now, we can find the probability of interest:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.25075)
≈ 0.4786

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4786}
