To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15 because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are faced with someone of equal height (in this case, someone who is 185 cm or taller). Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.80.

However, the witness also errs 20% of the time when faced with someone who is not 185 cm or taller. This means that even if the attacker was not 185 cm or taller, there's still a chance the witness might identify them as such. Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of randomly selecting someone shorter than 185 cm is 0.50. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10.

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find the ratio of the probability of both events A and B occurring to the probability of event B occurring.

P(A and B) = P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller whether or not they actually are. So P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.5455 or 54.55%.

So, given the information, there's approximately a 54.55% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
