To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(B|A): the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
2. P(A): proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the evidence. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the evidence under both conditions, A and not A.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, and we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(not B|not A) = 0.2.

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 = 0.1429 or approximately 14.29%

However, we strictly need to answer in the format with a number between 0 and 1, so we will provide:

{probability: 0.1429}
