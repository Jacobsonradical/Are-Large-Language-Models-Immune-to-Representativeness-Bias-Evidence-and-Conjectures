To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(W) * P(A|W) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, let's calculate P(W). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * (1 - P(A))

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(A). Instead, we can estimate P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we get:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * (1 - P(A)))

We can rewrite and simplify this expression:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|W) / P(A) = 0.8 / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))
1 / P(A) - 1 / (0.2 * P(A)) = 5

Solving this quadratic equation, we get two roots: one negative, which is not valid, and one positive:

P(A) ≈ 0.268

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.268}
