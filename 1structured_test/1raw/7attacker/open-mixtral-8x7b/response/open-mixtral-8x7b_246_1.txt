To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from b)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from b, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
