To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is NOT 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is NOT 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2963

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2963}
