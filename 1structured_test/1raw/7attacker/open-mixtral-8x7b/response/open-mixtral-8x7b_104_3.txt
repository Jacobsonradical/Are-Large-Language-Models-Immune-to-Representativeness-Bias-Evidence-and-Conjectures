To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is taller than 185 cm) = 0.8 (given in the problem as the witness's correct identification rate)
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 1
