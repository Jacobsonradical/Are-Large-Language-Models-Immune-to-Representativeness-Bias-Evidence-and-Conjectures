To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and multiply it by the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the city's population.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the height is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Since P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A),
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

The answer is:
{probability: 0.345}
