To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in the city and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% (from part a). However, the witness's observation introduces additional information that might change our estimate. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but their accuracy is only 80%.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness report)

We are given:
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%)
- P(Witness report | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 (80% accuracy)
- P(Witness report) is the same for both hypotheses (attacker is below 185 cm and attacker is 185 cm or taller), so we can cancel it out when calculating the posterior probability ratio.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, after considering the witness's report, is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness report) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.5349

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5349}
