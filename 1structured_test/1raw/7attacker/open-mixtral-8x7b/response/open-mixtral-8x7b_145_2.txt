To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in two steps. First, we use the city's population data to find the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller. Then, we apply the witness's classification skill to this probability.

Step 1: Probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller
P(Taller) = 1 - P(Shorter)
P(Shorter) = 85% = 0.85
P(Taller) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Step 2: Applying the witness's classification skill
The witness correctly identifies a taller person as taller 80% of the time, and the probability of this occurring is 0.8. The complementary probability is the witness incorrectly identifying a taller person as shorter, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate the final probability:
P(Taller | Witness identifies taller) = P(Witness identifies taller | Taller) * P(Taller)
P(Taller | Witness identifies taller) = 0.8 * 0.15
P(Taller | Witness identifies taller) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
