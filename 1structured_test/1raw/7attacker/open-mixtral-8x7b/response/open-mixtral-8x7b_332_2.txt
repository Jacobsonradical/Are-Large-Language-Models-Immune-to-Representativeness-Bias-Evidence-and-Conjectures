To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (H) given that they were identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (E).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

From the data, we have:
- P(H) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- P(E|H) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8

We also need to find P(E), the probability of the event that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H)
= [P(E|H) * P(H)] + [P(E|not H) * P(not H)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3571}
