To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement and their ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(A|W), where A is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and W is the witness's statement. We are given that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time, the witness errs in their judgment.

Therefore, we can calculate P(W|A), the probability of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as follows:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, to calculate P(A|W). However, we don't have enough information about the exact number of people in the city. But, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have any other information about the distribution of heights within the two groups, we cannot determine if the attacker is more likely to be from one group than the other. Therefore, the best estimate we can make is based on the total population. Thus, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

However, we don't have information about P(W), the overall probability of the witness's statement, given that they are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Since we don't have enough information to determine P(W), we cannot calculate P(A|W) directly.

In this case, we can only provide an estimate based on the given information, which suggests that the attacker is likely to be 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement. However, a precise numerical probability cannot be determined without additional information.
