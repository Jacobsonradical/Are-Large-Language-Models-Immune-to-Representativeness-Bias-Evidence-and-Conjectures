To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new available evidence. 

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which from the data is 15%.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
- P(A|B) as the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Then, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
