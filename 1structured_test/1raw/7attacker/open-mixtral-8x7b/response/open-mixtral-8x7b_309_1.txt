To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city: 15%. According to the witness, they correctly identify a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and they erroneously identify a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness)

P(witness | 185 cm) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80%, according to the witness's ability).

P(185 cm) is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (which is 15%).

P(witness) is the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(witness | <185 cm) * P(<185 cm)

where P(witness | <185 cm) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (which is 20%, according to the witness's ability). P(<185 cm) is the base rate of people who are shorter than 185 cm in the city, which is 85%.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(185 cm | witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.4109

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4109}
