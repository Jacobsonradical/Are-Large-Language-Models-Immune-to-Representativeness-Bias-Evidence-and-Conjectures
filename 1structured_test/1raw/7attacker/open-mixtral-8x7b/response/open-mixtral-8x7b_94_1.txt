To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.255 (the witness erred in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.255 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2145)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.3345
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3587

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3587.
