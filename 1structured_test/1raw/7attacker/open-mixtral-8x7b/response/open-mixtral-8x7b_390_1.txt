To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's assume that the witness's ability to judge a person's height is independent of the person's actual height. That is, the witness is equally likely to make a mistake regardless of whether the person is truly 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm.

Under this assumption, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is calculated as the sum of the following probabilities:
- P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
- P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.17 + 0.12)
= 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.5172413793103448

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 51.72%.
