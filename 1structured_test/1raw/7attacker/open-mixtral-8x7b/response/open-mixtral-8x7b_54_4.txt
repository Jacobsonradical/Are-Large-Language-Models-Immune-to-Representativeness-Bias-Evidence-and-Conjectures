To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, so the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as the product of the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population (15%) and the witness's accuracy rate when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (80%):

0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
