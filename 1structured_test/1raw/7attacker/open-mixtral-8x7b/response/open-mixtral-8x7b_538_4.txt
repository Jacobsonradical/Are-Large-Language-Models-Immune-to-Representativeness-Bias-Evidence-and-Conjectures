To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller attacked the victim given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the question, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's compute P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3158 or 31.58% (when expressed as a percentage)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3158 or 31.58%.
