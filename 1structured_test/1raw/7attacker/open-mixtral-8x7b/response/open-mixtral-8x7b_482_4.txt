To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (which according to the statement is 15% or 0.15).
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is actually 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness (which according to the statement is 80% or 0.8).
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is not 185 cm or taller is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (which according to the statement is 20% or 0.2).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to calculate P(not A) which is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, then P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we can calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A) which represents the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller even though they are not. This is calculated as (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the denominator of Bayes' theorem:
[P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report, is approximately 0.414.
