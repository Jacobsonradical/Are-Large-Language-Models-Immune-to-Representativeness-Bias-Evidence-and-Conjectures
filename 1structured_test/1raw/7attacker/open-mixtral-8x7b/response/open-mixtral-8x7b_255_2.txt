To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller. This information comes from the city's population distribution and is not affected by the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Now, let's consider the witness's reliability. When given a sample of people with half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This assessment is relevant to the specific situation when the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, but the witness may still make an error.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for this situation would be:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the city's population distribution, which is 15%.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that it is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and when it is shorter than 185 cm. The witness makes an error 20% of the time when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, so the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 20% * 85% = 17%. Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 80% * 15% + 17% = 23.5%.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 80% * 15% / 23.5% = 0.510204081632653

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.510204081632653}
