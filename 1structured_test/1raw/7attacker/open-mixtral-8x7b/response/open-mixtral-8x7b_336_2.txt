To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution of heights in the city.

Let's denote:

* P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
* P(B|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
* P(B|not A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the witness errs)
* P(not A): probability that the attacker's height was not 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|not A) = 0.15 (witness errs and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.15 \* 0.85

Now, we can find P(A):

P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.15 \* 0.85)

Solving this equation for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.573

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.573}
