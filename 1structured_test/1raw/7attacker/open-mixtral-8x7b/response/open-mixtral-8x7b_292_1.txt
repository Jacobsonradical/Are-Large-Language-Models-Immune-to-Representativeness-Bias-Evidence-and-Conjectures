To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W): probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(W'): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(S): probability that a person is shorter than 1
