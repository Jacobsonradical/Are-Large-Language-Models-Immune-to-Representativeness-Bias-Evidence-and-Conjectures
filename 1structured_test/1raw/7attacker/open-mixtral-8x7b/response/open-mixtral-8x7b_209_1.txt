To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem description, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - either the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (event ~A). Then, we can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can use the witness's error rate:

P(B|~A) = 1 - P(not B|~A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

We also know that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.608 + 0.68 = 0.888

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.888 â‰ˆ 0.1347

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 13.47%.
