To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city and the accuracy of the witness.

1. According to the information given, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is only 80% accurate, while they err in 20% of the cases.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

where A represents the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller", and B represents the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".
4. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(not A) = 0.85, and P(A) = 0.15.
5. We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is NOT 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is equally likely to make an error in both directions, P(B|not A) = 0.2.
6. Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
