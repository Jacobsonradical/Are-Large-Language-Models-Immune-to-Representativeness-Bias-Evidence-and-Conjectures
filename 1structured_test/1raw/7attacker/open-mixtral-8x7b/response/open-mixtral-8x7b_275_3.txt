To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this means that there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the person is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the person is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(E) = 0.15 (population distribution)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)

We are given:
- P(W|E) = 0.8
- P(E) = 0.15
- P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85

We need to find P(W|not E):
- The witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(W|not E) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(W) = 0.18 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(E|W):
P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)
P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35
P(E|W) = 0.12 / 0.35
P(E|W) â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.34}
