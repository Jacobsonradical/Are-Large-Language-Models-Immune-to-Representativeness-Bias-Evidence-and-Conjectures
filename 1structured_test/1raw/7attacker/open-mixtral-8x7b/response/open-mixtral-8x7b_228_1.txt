To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy (P(B|A) = 0.8) and errs with 20% (P(¬B|A) = 0.2). We also know that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a 50% probability (P(B) = 0.5, since the witness is just guessing half the time).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (P(A) = 0.15) and 85% is shorter than 185 cm (P(¬A) = 0.85).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, P(A|B), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 24%.

{probability: 0.24}
