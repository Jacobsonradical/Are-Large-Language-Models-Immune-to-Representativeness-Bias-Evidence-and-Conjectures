To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the available evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From statement (a), the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified 80% of the time)

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.15

To calculate P(E), we need to consider two cases: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.

P(E|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

From statement (a), the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(E|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(E) as the sum of these probabilities:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the evidence:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
