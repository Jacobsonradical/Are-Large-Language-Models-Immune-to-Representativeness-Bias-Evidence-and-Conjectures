To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

From the problem statement, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and the probability of selecting a person who is 185 cm or taller is 15%, as given in "b")
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

We need to estimate P(A) to calculate P(A|W). However, we don't have enough information about the attacker to make a precise estimate. Instead, we can consider two extreme cases: the attacker is equally likely to be shorter or taller than 185 cm (P(A)=0.5) or the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm (P(A)<0.5).

For P(A)=0.5, we have:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.17 * 0.5) ≈ 0.82

For P(A)=0.3 (as an example for P(A)<0.5), we have:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.3 / (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.17 * 0.7) ≈ 0.59

Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be between 0.59 and 0.82, with a more likely estimate around 0.82 when assuming equal probability of the attacker being shorter or taller than 185 cm.
