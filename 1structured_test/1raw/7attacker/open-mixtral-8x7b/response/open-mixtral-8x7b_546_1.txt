To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, compute P(B|A) * P(A):
P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

Next, compute P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85) * (0.8) = 0.136

Finally, compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.136) = 0.46875

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.46875.
