To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W - the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
