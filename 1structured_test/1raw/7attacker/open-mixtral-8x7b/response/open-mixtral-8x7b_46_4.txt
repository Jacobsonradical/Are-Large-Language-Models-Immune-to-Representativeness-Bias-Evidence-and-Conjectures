To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
