To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We are given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. Additionally, the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

Now we need to calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller). This is the case when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (true positive) and when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness misidentifies them (false positive).

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

We need to calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller). This is the false positive rate, which is 1 - the true negative rate (0.8). We are given that the true negative rate is 80%, so the false positive rate is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, let's calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
