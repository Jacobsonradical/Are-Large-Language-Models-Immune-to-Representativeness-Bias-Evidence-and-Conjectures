To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A), given that they were identified as such by the witness (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We need to find P(B and A) and P(B and not A).

P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B and not A) = P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
