To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability rule, which states that the probability of an event A can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of A given B1 * probability of B1, A given B2 * probability of B2, and so on for all possible events B1, B2, ..., Bn.

In this case, the event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the possible events B1, B2 are the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifying the height, and the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness mistakenly thinking the person is 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Therefore, the probability of A can be calculated as:

P(A) = P(A and B1) + P(A and B2)
= P(A | B1) * P(B1) + P(A | B2) * P(B2)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.29 or 29%.
