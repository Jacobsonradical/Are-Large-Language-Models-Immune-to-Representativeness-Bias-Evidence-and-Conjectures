To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): the probability that the witness identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm
- P(S): the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 1
