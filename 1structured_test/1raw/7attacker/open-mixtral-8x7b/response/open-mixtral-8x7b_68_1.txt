To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353 (when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, the witness errs 20% of the time, and there is a 85% chance of not being 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.2353 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3829

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3829 or 38.29%.
