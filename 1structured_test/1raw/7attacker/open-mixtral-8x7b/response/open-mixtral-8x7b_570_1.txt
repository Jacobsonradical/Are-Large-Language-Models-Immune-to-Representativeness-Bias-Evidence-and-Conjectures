To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information, we can calculate:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

P(not A) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36
