To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the given information, we have:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(E|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness mistakenly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.476

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.476 or 47.6%.
