To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From statement a, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B'|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in judgment 20% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, where B' denotes the complementary event of B)

From statement b, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that P(B'|A') = 1 - P(B|A') and P(B|A') = P(A'|B) * P(A') / (P(A'|B) * P(A') + P(A|B) * P(A)). Solving for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - P(B|A')) * 0.85)

Now, we need to find P(B|A'), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it follows that:

P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.8

Substituting this value into the equation for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.2 * 0.8) * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.616)
= 0.1633 or 16.33%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 16.33%.
