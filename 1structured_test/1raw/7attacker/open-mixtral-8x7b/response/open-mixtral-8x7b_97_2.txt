To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability we want to find) is proportional to the likelihood times the prior probability.

First, let's find the prior probability, which is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in this city, based on the given information:
P(A) = Probability of being 185 cm or taller
= 15% (since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's find the likelihood, which is the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are:
P(B|A) = Probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
= 80% (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

However, we also need to consider the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since half of the sample is shorter than 185 cm, we have:
P(B|¬A) = Probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller
= 50% of 50% = 25% (since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 50% of the cases are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can find the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.25 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2125)
= 0.12 / 0.3325
= 0.3607 (approximately)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3607 or 36.07%.
