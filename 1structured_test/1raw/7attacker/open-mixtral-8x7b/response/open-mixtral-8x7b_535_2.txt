To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.8 when they actually are, and erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2 when they are not. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (because 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. And P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller and the witness erroneously identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85 * 0.5)
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205
â‰ˆ 0.585

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.585}
