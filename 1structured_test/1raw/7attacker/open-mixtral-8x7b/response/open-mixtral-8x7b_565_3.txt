To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

P(A|W) = 0.8 (the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller in the city)

We want to find P(W|A), the probability of the witness's statement given the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness's statement regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and we know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. To find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness's statement given the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time:

P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
