To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
- C as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the witness identified the attacker correctly,
- D as the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we know:
P(C|A) = 1 (the witness correctly identified the height when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(D|A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|D) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identified the height as 185 cm or taller in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem,
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and D)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|D) * P(D)
P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688
