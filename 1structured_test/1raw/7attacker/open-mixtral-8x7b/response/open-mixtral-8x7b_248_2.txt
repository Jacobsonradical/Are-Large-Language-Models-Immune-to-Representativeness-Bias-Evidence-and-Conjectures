To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(¬B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying the height as shorter than 1
