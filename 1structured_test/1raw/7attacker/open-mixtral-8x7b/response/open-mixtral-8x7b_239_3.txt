To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- W_Correct: Event that the witness correctly identifies the height
- W_Incorrect: Event that the witness incorrectly identifies the height

From the given information, we have:
P(T) = x
P(S) = 1 - x

We are given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time (W_Correct) and errs 20% of the time (W_Incorrect).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(T | W_Correct) = P(W_Correct | T) * P(T) / (P(W_Correct | T) * P(T) + P(W_Correct | S) * P(S))

Using the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- P(W_Correct | T) = 0.8
- P(W_Incorrect | S) = 0.2

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:
- P(W_Correct | S) = P(S) * 0.8 + (1 - P(S)) * 0.2 = 0.8 - 0.6 * P(S)

Now, we can calculate P(T | W_Correct):
P(T | W_Correct) = (0.8 * x) / ((0.8 * x) + (0.8 - 0.6 * (1 - x)) * (1 - x))

We are not given a specific value for x. However, if we want to estimate the maximum possible value for the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, we can assume x = 1, i.e., the attacker's height is definitely 185 cm or taller:

P(T | W_Correct) = (0.8 * 1) / ((0.8 * 1) + (0.8 - 0.6 * 0) * (1 - 1)) = 0.8

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height, the maximum possible estimate for the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller would then be 0.8.
