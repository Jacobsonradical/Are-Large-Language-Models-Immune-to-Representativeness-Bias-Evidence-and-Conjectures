To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) = probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller (from the city statistics)
P(B) = probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller
P(B|not A) = probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 15%, P(B|A) = 80%, P(B|not A) = 20%, and we need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to find P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 34.5%.
