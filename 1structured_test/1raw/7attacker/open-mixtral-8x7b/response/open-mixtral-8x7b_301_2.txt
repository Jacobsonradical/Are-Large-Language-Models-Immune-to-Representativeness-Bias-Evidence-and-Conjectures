To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%. However, this doesn't take into account the witness's ability to judge height under the given conditions.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height is 80%.
- Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 15% * 80% = 12%.

Scenario 2: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height is 20%.
- Given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 50% * 20% = 10%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:
P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identification)

We can calculate P(witness identification) as the sum of the probabilities of each scenario:
P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification | shorter) * P(shorter)
                                   = 12% + 10% = 22%

Therefore:
P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 12% / 22%

The answer is:
{probability: 0.545, "This is approximately 54.5%, meaning there is a slightly higher than even chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller."}
