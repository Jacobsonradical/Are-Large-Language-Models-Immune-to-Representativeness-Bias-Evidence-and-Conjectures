To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

From statement (a), we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From statement (b), we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445) = 0.12 / 0.2645 = 0.4536

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4536}
