To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A): Probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller in the city = 15% = 0.15
P(B): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B|A'): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2

Now, we want to find P(A'), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since there are only two possibilities (A or A'), P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Next, we're looking for P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. Since P(B|A) = P(B and A) / P(A), we have P(B and A) = P(A) * P(B|A). In this case, P(B and A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such.

We also know that P(B and A') = P(A') * P(B|A'), where P(B and A') is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller.

Now, we use the total probability theorem: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A').

We have all the necessary values to compute this:
P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A')
0.8 = 0.15 * P(B|A) + 0.85 * 0.2
0.8 = 0.15 * P(B|A) + 0.17
0.63 = 0.15 * P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.63 / 0.15 = 4.2

However, this probability is greater than 1, which means we made an error in our calculations. We should have used the complementary probabilities for P(B|A) and P(B|A'):

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B'|A')
0.8 = 0.15 * (1 - P(B|A)) + 0.85 * (1 - P(B|A'))
0.8 = 0.15 - 0.15 * P(B|A) + 0.85 - 0.85 * P(B|A')
0.65 = -0.15 * P(B|A) + 0.85 * P(B|A')

Since we want to find P(B|A), let's isolate that term:

0.65 + 0.15 * P(B|A) = 0.85 * P(B|A')
0.65 / 0.7 = P(B|A')
P(B|A') = 0.92857
P(B|A) = 1 - P(B|A') = 1 - 0.92857 = 0.07143

Now we have the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided:
