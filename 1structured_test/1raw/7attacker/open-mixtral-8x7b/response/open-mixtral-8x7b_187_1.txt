To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's break down the problem:
1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identifies correctly and attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness identifies correctly and attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identifies correctly)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identifies correctly) + P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identifies incorrectly)
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identifies correctly and attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
