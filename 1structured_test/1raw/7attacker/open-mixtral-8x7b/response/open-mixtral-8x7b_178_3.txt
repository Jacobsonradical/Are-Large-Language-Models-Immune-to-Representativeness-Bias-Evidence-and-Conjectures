To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A ≥ 185 cm) = P(A ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies correctly) * P(witness identifies correctly) + P(A ≥ 185 cm | witness errs) * P(witness errs)

From the given information, we have:
- P(witness identifies correctly) = 0.8
- P(witness errs) = 0.2
- P(A ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from point b)
- P(A < 185 cm) = 0.85 (from point b)
- P(witness identifies A ≥ 185 cm | A ≥ 185 cm) = 1 (if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such)
- P(witness identifies A < 185 cm | A < 185 cm) = 0.8 (from point a)

Now, we need to find P(witness identifies A ≥ 185 cm | witness errs) and P(witness identifies A < 185 cm | witness errs):

- P(witness identifies A ≥ 185 cm | witness errs) = P(witness identifies A ≥ 185 cm) and (witness errs) = P(A < 185 cm) * P(witness identifies A ≥ 185 cm | A < 185 cm) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
- P(witness identifies A < 185 cm | witness errs) = P(witness identifies A < 185 cm) and (witness errs) = P(A ≥ 185 cm) * P(witness identifies A < 185 cm | A ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 * 0 = 0

Now, we can substitute these values into our initial formula:

P(A ≥ 185 cm) = (1 * 0.8) + (0.17 * 0.2) = 0.8 + 0.034 = 0.834

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.834}.
