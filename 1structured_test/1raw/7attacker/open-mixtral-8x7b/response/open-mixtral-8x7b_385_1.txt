To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:
P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm):
P(Incorrectly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, let's calculate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(185 cm or taller | Correctly identified by witness) = P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / (P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Incorrectly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm))

We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and 85% is shorter than 185 cm:
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Substituting the values into the formula:
P(185 cm or taller | Correctly identified by witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.375}
