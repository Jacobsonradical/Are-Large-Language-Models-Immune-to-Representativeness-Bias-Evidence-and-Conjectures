To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(A) = 15% or 0.15).
- P(~A) as the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (from the data, P(~A) = 85% or 0.85).
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8).
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(B|~A) = 20% or 0.2).
- P(B) is what we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

First, we compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies him (P(B|A) * P(A)), or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but the witness mistakenly identifies him as 185 cm or taller (P(B|~A) * P(~A)).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 or 34.5%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 34.5%.
