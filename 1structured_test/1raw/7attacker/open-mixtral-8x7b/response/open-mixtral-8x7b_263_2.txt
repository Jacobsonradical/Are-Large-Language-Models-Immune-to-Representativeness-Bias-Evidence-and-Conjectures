To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- D: the observed data, which is the witness's statement

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the problem description, we have the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(D|not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D), where P(D) can be computed as P(D) = P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not H) * P(not H). Since P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we have:

P(D) = P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not H) * P(not H)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can compute P(H|D):

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2645
= 0.12 * 3.7838
= 0.4540

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4540, or 45.40%.
