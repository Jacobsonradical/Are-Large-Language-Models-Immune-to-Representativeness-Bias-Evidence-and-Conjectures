To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the witness's performance.
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on the witness's performance.
- P(A') as the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm in the city's population, which is 0.85.
- P(B') as the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller in the city's population, which is 0.15.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A):

P(A) = P(A|W)
= [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / 0.22
= 0.545454545455 â‰ˆ 0.55 (rounded to two decimal places).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.55}
