To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. When presented with a sample of people, the witness correctly identified someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This means that the witness's false positive rate (identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) is 20%.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We can set up the problem as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's 80% accuracy rate for identifying people as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the population statistics. This is equal to 15%.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identified them as such, plus the probability that the attacker's height was not actually 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identified them as such.

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
= 0.288 / (0.288 + 0.17)
= 0.62963 (rounded to 6 decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.62963}.
