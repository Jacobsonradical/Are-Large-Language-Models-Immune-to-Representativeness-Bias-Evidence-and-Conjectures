To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm)

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|A') = 0.2
- P(A') = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))
= 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

We want to find P(A), so let's rewrite the equation as:

P(A) = P(A|W) / (0.64 * P(A|W) + 0.17)

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate P(A|W) to be around 0.8 (as the witness was correct 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller).

So, P(A) = 0.8 / (0.64 * 0.8 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.83

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.83 (or 83%).
