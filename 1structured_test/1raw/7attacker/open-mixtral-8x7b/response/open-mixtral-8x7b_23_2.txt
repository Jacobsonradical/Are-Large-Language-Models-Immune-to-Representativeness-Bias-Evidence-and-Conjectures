To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness's identification. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify them as such. However, if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there is still a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify them as such.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (in this case, the base rate of 0.15) based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification, P(A|B) is the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, and P(B|A) is the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
