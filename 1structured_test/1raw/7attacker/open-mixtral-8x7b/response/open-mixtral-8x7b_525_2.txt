To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence. We are given:
- P(B|A) = the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time = 0.8
- P(A) = proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15
- P(B) is the probability of observing the given evidence, which can be broken down into the sum of probabilities for two mutually exclusive cases:
  - the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies it (P(B|A) * P(A))
  - the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identifies it as 185 cm or taller (P(B|A') * P(A'))

We need to compute P(B|A'), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.197.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.197 â‰ˆ 0.609

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.609.
