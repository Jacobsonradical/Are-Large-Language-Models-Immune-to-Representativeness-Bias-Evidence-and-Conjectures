To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's use the following variables:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(S) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|S) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
4. P(W|S) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time)

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|S) * P(S))

First, calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|S) * P(S)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
