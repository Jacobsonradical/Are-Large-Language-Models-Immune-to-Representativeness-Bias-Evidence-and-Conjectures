To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which we know from statement (a) is 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we know from statement (b) is 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which we know from statement (b) is 0.2.
- P(A|B) as the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(A), P(B|A), P(B|not A), and we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values in, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.
