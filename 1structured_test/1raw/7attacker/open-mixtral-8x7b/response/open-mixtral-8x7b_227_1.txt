To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.4 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability of not A, which is the complement of P(A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we can calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now we can calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.41) = 0.1220 (rounded to 0.12)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is 0.12.
