To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will calculate P(A|B) where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the observed information about the witness's identification and the city's population distribution.

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% from the city's population)

P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (the witness's 80% accuracy)

P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (the witness's 20% error rate)

P(not A) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% from the city's population)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
          = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
