To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller (from the city statistics).
- P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the probability that a person is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they truly are.

From the information provided, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and we need to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). 

However, we don't know P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for both cases: the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the person is not, but the witness identifies them as such.

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). 

P(not A) is the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343.

However, this result seems counter-intuitive because it's actually slightly more likely that the witness is wrong than right given the provided statistics. This could be due to insufficient or potentially misleading information. Nonetheless, strictly following the given data and Bayes' theorem, the answer is:

{probability: 0.343}
