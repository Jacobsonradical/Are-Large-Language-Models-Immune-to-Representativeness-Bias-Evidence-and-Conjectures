To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given by the court: 0.50 (since 50% of the sample were 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller: 0.15 (from part b)
P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller: 0.80 (from part a)
P(A|B) = The probability we want to calculate, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. This can be calculated as:

P(not A) = The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 0.50 (from part a)
P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm: 0.20 (from part a)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = [0.80 * 0.50] / [0.80 * 0.50 + 0.10] = 0.80 / 0.90 â‰ˆ 0.8889

Format answer: {probability: 0.8889}
