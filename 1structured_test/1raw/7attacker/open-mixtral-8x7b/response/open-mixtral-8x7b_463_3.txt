To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)

P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, where ¬A denotes the complementary event of ¬A)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(W|¬A):
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
