To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the evidence provided by the witness.

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the problem, we are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(D|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, where ~H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H)]

First, calculate P(D|~H) * P(~H) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17
Then, calculate P(D|H) * P(H) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

Now, add these two values together: P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, divide the second term by this sum to find P(H|D):
P(H|D) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
