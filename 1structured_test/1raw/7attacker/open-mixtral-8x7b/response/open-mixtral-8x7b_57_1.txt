To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)

However, we also need to know P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This involves the error rate of the witness when judging someone as shorter than 1
