To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the evidence from the witness.
- Let J represent the judgment of the court about the witness's ability to judge a person's height.
- Let S represent the evidence about the distribution of heights in the city population.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|DJ) = P(DJ|H) * P(H) / P(DJ)

We want to find P(H|DJ), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the witness and the court's assessment of the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions.

To calculate this probability, we need to find the following terms:

P(DJ|H): the probability of observing the evidence from the witness, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, P(DJ|H) = 0.8

P(H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15

P(DJ): the probability of observing the evidence from the witness, regardless of the attacker's height.

To calculate P(DJ), we need to find the probabilities of the witness identifying a person's height correctly or incorrectly, for both tall and short people. Let T represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let S represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:
- P(DJ|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person's height 80% of the time)
- P(DJ|S) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(DJ) as follows:

P(DJ) = P(DJ|T) * P(T) + P(DJ|S) * P(S)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|DJ) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|DJ) = P(DJ|H) * P(H) / P(DJ)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931034482759

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
