To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(S) = 0.85 and P(T) = 0.15.

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that they correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and err 20% of the time (classifying them as shorter than 185 cm).

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability we are looking for is the posterior probability P(T|I), where I is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(T|I) as follows:

P(T|I) = P(I|T) * P(T) / P(I)

Here, P(I|T) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8, as stated in the problem.

P(I) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(I) = P(I|T) * P(T) + P(I|S) * P(S)

Now, we need to calculate P(I|S), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.2, as stated in the problem.

Now, we can compute P(I):

P(I) = P(I|T) * P(T) + P(I|S) * P(S) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(T|I) = P(I|T) * P(T) / P(I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
