To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the true population probability is 15%, which is the same as the witness's accuracy in such cases, so it's 80% or 0.8.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are missing P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have specific information about the attacker, we can't determine this probability. However, since the witness's accuracy is higher for taller individuals, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

So, I cannot provide an exact numerical estimate for P(A|B), but based on the information provided, I would lean towards a higher probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. If additional information is provided about the attacker, such as their age, sex, or general height distribution in the population, we could refine our estimate.
