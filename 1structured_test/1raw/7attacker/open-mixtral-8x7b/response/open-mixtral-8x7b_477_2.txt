To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

First, let's define the following events:
- W: The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.
- W': The witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller (when they are actually shorter than 185 cm).
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- A': The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in finding P(A|W'), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as such.

From the problem statement, we know that:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(W'|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
3. P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|W'):

P(A|W') = P(W'|A) * P(A) / P(W')

To calculate P(W'|A), we can use the fact that P(W|A) + P(W'|A) = 1, so P(W'|A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we need to find P(W'). Using the law of total probability, we can calculate:

P(W') = P(W'|A) * P(A) + P(W'|A') * P(A')

However, we don't have enough information to find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's testimony is the only information we have, it is reasonable to assume that the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is the same as the base rate in the population, which is P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(W'):

P(W') = P(W'|A) * P(A) + P(W'|A') * P(A')
= 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.03 + 0.17
= 0.20

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W'):

P(A|W') = P(W'|A) * P(A) / P(W')
= 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.20
= 0.15 / 0.20
= 0.75

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as such, is 0.75.

In the requested format: {probability: 0.75}
