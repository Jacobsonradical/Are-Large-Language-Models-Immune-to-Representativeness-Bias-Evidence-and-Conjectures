To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (which is 15% from the information provided).
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually that tall (which is 80% from the information provided).
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they are actually not (which is 20% from the information provided).
- P(not A) is the probability of a random person in the city not being 185 cm or taller, which is 100% - 15% = 85%.
- P(A|B) is the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller after observing the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the values into the formula gives us:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.36.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
