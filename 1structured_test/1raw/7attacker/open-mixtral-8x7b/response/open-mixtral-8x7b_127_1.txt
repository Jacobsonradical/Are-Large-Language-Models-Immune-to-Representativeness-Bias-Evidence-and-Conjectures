To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

First, let's define some terms:
- Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- Let S be the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H)

We are given:
- P(W|H) = 0.8
- P(H) = 0.15
- P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

We need to find P(W|not H):

P(W|not H) = P(W and not H) / P(not H)

We are given:
- P(W and not H) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

So:

P(W|not H) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2353 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2944

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2944 ≈ 0.3704

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3704.
