To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(B|A) * P(A):
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
