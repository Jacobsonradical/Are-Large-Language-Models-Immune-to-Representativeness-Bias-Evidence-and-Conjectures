To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information a).
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time for people of this height, P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A'') as the probability that a person is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
- P(B|A'') as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is NOT actually 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time for people of this height, P(B|A'') = 0.2.

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller GIVEN that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A'') = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A'') \* P(A'') = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.3429

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3429}
