To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to calculate.

P(B) = Probability of a random person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to the given data.

P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 according to the given data.

P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, which is the quantity we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to solve for P(A|B), so we can rearrange the formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.15

To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability. Let's denote P(A') as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, we know that:

P(A) + P(A') = 1

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, we have:

P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

P(B'|A') = 0.8 (the witness identifies the person as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(A') = 0.85

Using the law of total probability, we can find P(A):

P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
