To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height, and B be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|¬B) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, i.e., shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(B|A), which can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / [P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|¬B) \* P(¬B)]
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.413793103}
