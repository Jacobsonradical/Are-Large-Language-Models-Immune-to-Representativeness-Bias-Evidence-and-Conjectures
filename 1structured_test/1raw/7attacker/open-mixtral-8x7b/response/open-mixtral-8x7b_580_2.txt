To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and only 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85))

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5862
