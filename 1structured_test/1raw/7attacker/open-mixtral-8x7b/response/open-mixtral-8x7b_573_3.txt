To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we calculate P(W|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.3158 (31.58%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3158 (31.58%).
