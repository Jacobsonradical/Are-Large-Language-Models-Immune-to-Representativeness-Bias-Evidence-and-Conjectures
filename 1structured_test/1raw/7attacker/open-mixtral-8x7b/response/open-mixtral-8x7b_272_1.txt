To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the witness would identify them correctly.

Formally, P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) = 0.8

However, we don't know whether the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. To find that, we can use the information from statement (b), which tells us that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Formally, P(attacker is tall) = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness says tall)

The probability of the witness saying tall can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness saying tall when the attacker is tall and the witness saying tall when the attacker is short. We know the individual probabilities from statement (a) and the distribution of heights from statement (b).

P(witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness says tall | attacker is short) * P(attacker is short)
P(witness says tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(witness says tall) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(witness says tall) = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness says tall)
P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = 0.3448275862068966

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.34 (or 34%).
