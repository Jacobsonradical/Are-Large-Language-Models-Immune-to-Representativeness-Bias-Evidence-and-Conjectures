To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2. We need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we can find P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
