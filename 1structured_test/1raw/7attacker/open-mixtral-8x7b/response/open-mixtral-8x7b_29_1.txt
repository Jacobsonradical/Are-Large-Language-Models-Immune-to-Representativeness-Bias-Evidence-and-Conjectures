To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
P(A) = 0.15 (from point a; 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from point b; the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from point b; the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.17)] ≈ 0.3158

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3158 (or 31.58% when expressed as a percentage).
