Let's analyze the information given:

a) We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

b) A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate, but also made errors 20% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15 (15%).

To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement, we can multiply these two probabilities:

0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.15 (prior probability) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
