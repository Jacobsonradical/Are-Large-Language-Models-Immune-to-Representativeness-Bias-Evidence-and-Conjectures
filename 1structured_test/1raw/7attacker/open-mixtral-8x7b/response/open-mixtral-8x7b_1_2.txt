To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as such by the witness (B). 

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (8.5% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are and when they are not. Using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
