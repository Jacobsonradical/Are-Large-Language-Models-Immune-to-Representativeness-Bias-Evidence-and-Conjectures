To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. However, the witness's ability to judge a person's height is not perfect. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Then, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. We also know that P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event B and A), and the case where the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event B and not A).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
