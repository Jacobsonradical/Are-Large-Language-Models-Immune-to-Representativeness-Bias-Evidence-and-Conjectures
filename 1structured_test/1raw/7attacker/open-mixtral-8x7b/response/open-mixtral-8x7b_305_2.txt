To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the population statistics.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, we can say that:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population, which we know is 15%.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can combine these two probabilities to get the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) x P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know the values of all of these probabilities except for P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm). Since the witness erred 20% of the time, we can say that:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Therefore, we can calculate:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 x 0.15) + (0.2 x 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting this value into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 x 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.321

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.321}
