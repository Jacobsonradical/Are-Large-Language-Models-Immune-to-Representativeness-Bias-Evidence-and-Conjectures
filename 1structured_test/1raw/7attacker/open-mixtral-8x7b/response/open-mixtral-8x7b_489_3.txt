To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.
- P(B): The overall probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is a combination of the above two cases, i.e., P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Substituting the values, we get:
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem, we get:
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 approximately.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
