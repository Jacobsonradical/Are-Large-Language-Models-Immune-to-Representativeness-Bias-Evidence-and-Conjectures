To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we compute P(¬A), which is the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Next, we calculate the numerator of the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, we calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
