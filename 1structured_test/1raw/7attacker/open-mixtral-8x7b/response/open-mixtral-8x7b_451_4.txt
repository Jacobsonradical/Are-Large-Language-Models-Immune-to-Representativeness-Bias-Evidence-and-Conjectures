To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the question, we are given:
P(A): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A): probability that a witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8

We need to find P(B), the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them, and the probability that the person is shorter than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
