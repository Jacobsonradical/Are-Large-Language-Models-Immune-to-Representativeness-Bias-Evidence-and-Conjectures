To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the witness's error led to the identification of the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(~E): probability that the witness's identification was correct

We know from the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(E|A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of cases when the height was 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~E) * P(~E)]

We are looking for P(B|A), which is the probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the height is 185 cm or taller, it means that P(B|A) = 0.8 (100% - 20%).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.8 * (1 - 0.15))]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.1212 (12.12%)

However, since we need the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller after the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, we need to find P(A|B) instead of P(B|A).

We already calculated P(A|B), which is approximately 12.12%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.1212}
