To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm

From the given information, we know:
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(W|A') = 0.2
P(A') = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A) using the Bayes theorem:

P(A) = P(A'|W) * P(W)

We have P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') = 0.8*P(A) + 0.2*0.15

So,
P(A'|W) = 1 - P(A|W) = (1 - P(W|A)) * P(A') / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')) = (1 - 0.8) * 0.85 / ((0.8*P(A)) + (0.2*0.15))

Since we want to calculate P(A), we can set P(A'|W) to the given population statistics of 0.15 (15%).

0.15 = (0.2 * 0.85) / ((0.8*P(A)) + (0.2*0.15))

Solving for P(A):

(0.8*P(A)) + (0.2*0.15) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.15
0.8*P(A) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.15 - 0.2*0.15
P(A) = (0.2 * 0.85 / 0.15 - 0.2*0.15) / 0.8
P(A) = 0.175

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.175 (17.5%).
