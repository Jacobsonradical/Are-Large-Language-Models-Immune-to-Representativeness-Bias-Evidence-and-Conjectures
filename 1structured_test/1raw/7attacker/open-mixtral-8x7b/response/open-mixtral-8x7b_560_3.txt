To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
P(E) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the true height

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(E|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(A), we need the prior probability P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(E|¬A) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.83 * 0.85) = 0.724 + 0.7055 = 0.42955

Finally, we calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42955
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2807

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information is approximately 0.2807.
