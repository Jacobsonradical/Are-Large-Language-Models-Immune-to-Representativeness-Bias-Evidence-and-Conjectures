To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following two pieces of information:

1. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
2. In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the person is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the problem, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified an 185 cm or taller person)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identified a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, by using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 ≈ 0.4537

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4537}
