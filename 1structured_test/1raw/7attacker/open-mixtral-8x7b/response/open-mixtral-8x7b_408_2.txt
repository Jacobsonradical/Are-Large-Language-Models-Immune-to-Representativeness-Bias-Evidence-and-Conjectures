To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We will consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Case 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
The probability of this case is P(A1). We don't have specific information about this probability, so we will calculate the conditional probability based on the given information.

Case 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
The probability of this case is P(A2) = 1 - P(A1).

Now, let's calculate the probability of observing the witness's statement (W) given each case.

P(W|A1) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (given in the question)

P(W|A2) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Using the total probability theorem:

P(A1) = P(A1 ∩ W) + P(A1 ∩ W')

We are interested in P(A1 ∩ W), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A1 ∩ W) = P(A1) * P(W|A1)

To find P(A1), we use the law of total probability:

P(A1) = P(A1 ∩ W) + P(A1 ∩ W') = P(W) = 0.8 * P(A1) + 0.2 * P(A2)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we know that P(A2) = 0.85 and P(A1) = 0.15. Therefore,

0.15 = 0.8 * 0.15 * P(A1) + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(A1), we get P(A1) ≈ 0.3478.

Now, we can calculate our final estimate:

P(A1|W) = P(A1 ∩ W) / P(W) = P(A1 ∩ W) / (0.8 * P(A1) + 0.2 * P(A2)) ≈ 0.3083

However, since we are looking for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we want P(A1|W):

{probability: 0.3083}
