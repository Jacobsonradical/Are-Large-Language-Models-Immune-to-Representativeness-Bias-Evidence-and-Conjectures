To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events (A and B). In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to compute the prior probability P(A) and likelihood P(B|A).

P(A) is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. We are told that 15% of the population meets this criteria, so P(A) = 0.15.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. We are told that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to compute the likelihood P(B|¬A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. We are told that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

The prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is given by P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A). We are not given P(¬A), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. However, we are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(¬A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33.

Now we can compute the posterior probability P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.33) = 0.12 / 0.33 ≈ 0.364.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.364}
