To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80% or 0.8.
P(B) as the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which we need to calculate.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positive rate (when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them) and the false positive rate (when the person is not 185 cm or taller but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138 or 41.38%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 41.38%.
