To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

P(witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of cases where a person was shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to find P(person is 185 cm or taller) and P(person is shorter than 185 cm). According to the data provided:

P(person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

P(person is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(person is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller) = (Probability that the person is 185 cm or taller * Probability that the witness identifies the person correctly) / (Probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller)

P(person is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller) = (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2))

P(person is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 (37.5%).
