To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) = probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(B) = probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B) = probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(C) = probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the available information

Bayes' theorem states:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / (P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|¬C) * P(¬C))

We are given P(A) = 0.15, which we will use as our prior for P(C). We want to find the posterior probability P(C|B).

We are also given P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(¬B|C) = 0.2. Now we need to find P(¬B|¬C), the probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is 80% accurate, P(¬B|¬C) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = (P(B|C) * P(C)) / (P(B|¬C) * P(¬C)) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.12 / 0.14 = 0.8571

Finally, we calculate the posterior probability:

P(C|B) = LR * P(C) / (LR * P(C) + P(¬B|¬C)) = 0.8571 * 0.15 / (0.8571 * 0.15 + 0.8) = 0.1286

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1286 or 12.86% (when rounded to two decimal places).
