To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(S): probability that a person in the city's population is 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height)
- P(E|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying the height)
- P(S) = 0.15 (probability that a person in the city's population is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

To calculate P(B|¬A), we use the witness's error rate when the actual height is not 185 cm or taller:
P(B|¬A) = P(E) = 0.2

Thus,
P(B) = (0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A))

Now, let's find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8) \* P(A) / ((0.8) \* P(A) + (0.2) \* (1 - P(A)))

We do not have enough information to determine the value of P(A). However, if we assume that the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller than the general population, then we can estimate a lower bound for P(A|B) by setting P(A) = P(S) = 0.15.

Plugging in the value, we get:

P(A|B) >= (0.8) \* 0.15 / ((0.8) \* 0.15 + (0.2) \* (1 - 0.15)) = 0.36

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
