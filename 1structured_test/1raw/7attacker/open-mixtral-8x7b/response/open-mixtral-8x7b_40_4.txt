To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the question, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.20 (the witness errs and says 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we compute P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We do this using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
      = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
