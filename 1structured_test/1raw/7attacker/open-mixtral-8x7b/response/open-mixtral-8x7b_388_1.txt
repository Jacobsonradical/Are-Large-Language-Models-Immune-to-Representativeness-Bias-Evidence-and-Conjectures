To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that P(A), the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 since 15% of the population falls into this category.

We also know that P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are, is 0.8. Similarly, P(B|not A), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are not, is 0.2.

We can now calculate P(not A), the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, as 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.345.
