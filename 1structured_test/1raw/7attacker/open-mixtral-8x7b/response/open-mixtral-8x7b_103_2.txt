To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in two steps. First, we use the city's population statistics to find the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller. Then, we adjust this probability using the witness's assessment.

Step 1: According to the city's population statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is initially 0.15.

Step 2: We now use the witness's ability to assess a person's height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging whether someone is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability of this statement being correct.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We already have P(B|A) from the witness's ability to assess a person's height, which is 0.8 (80% chance of being correct). We also have P(A) from the city's population statistics, which is 0.15 (15% chance of being 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when they are not. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they actually are is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can compute the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
