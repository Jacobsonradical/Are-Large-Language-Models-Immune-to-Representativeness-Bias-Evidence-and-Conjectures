To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
2. P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is what we want to find. However, since we don't know this, we'll come back to it later.
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of identifying an attacker of that height given that he is or is not, weighted by the probabilities of each actual height.
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, and from the problem statement, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

For P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, this is given as the error rate which is 20% or 0.2.

And we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(not A) = 0.85.

So, P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 = 0.07843 or 7.843%

However, since probabilities should be between 0 and 1, we normalize this value by dividing by the sum of P(A|B) and P(not A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.07843 / (0.07843 + 0.92157 * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.07843 / 0.92157 = 0.0851 or 8.51%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 8.51%.
