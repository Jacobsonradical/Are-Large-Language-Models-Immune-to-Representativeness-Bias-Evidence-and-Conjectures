To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). 

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so:
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
