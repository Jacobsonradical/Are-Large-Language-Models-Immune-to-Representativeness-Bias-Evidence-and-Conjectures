To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from point a).
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from point b).
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., shorter than 185 cm), which is 0.2 (from point b).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

We are given P(A), P(B|A), and P(B|not A). To proceed, we need to calculate P(not A), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.8)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.16) = 0.09 / 0.25 â‰ˆ 0.36

My estimate is: {probability: 0.36}
