To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population
- P(B): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (i.e., the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A|B): the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8
- P(B'|A') = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can apply Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

First, let's calculate P(B|A'):

P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.
