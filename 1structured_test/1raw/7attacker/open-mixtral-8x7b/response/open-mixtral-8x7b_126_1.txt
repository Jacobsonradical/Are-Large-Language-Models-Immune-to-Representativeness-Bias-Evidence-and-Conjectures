To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

To calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we have:
