To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 in the question.

2. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 in the question since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

3. P(B): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate this as follows:

   P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
   = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29

So, the posterior probability P(A|B) is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
