To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(not A) is the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.096 / [0.096 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.096 / 0.266
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36129

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36129 (36.129%).
