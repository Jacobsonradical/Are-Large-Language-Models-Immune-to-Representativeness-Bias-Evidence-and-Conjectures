To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided by the witness and the general population statistics.

Using the information given, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people who are shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the available evidence:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.55

So, given the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.55}
