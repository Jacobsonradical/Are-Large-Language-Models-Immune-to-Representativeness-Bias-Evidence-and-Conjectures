To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

1. The probability that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(A) = 0.85
2. The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, P(B) = 0.15
3. The conditional probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given their actual height, P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
4. The conditional probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given their actual height is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs and says 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement, P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to find the probability of a randomly chosen person being shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.85) / [(0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.88

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.88 or 88%.
