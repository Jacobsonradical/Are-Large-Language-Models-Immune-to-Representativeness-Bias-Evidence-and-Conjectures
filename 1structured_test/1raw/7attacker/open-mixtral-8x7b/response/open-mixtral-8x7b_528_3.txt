To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information, one about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the other about the population distribution.

Let's define:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) as the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is also 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A'|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

However, we don't have direct information about P(B|A) since the witness's accuracy is given as a probability for a random sample, not a sample given that the person is 185 cm or taller. To account for this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
          = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We can solve for P(B|A):

P(B|A) = (P(B) - P(B|A') * P(A')) / P(A)
              = (0.15 - 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)) / 0.15
              â‰ˆ 0.76

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.76 * 0.15 / 0.15
        = 0.76

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.76.
