To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as such by a witness (B).

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.

Next, let's denote P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the given information.

Now, we also need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller. Since 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies someone's height, they must incorrectly identify someone's height 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.4537 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4537 or 45.37%.
