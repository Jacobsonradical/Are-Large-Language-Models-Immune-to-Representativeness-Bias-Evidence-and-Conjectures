To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's ability to accurately judge height.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but their accuracy rate is 80%. 
3. This means that, even though the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's still a 20% chance they were mistaken.
4. Given the witness's error rate and the fact that 15% of the population meets this description, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To compute the estimate, let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(¬A): Probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is NOT 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|¬A): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is NOT actually 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15
P(B|A) = 0.80
P(¬A) = 0.85
P(B|¬A) = 0.20

We want to find: P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller GIVEN that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the probability:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given values:
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
