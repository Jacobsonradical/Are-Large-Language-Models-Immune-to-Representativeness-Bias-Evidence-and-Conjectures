To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B).

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm; and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3165

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3165.
