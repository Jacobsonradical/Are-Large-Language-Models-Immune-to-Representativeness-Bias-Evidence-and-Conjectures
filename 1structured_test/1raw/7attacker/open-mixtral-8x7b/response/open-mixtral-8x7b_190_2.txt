To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (A'). Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (because the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (because 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
