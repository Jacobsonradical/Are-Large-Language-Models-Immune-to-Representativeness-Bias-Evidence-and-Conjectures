To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the baseline probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from point a).

Next, we need to account for the witness's accuracy in judging a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (from point b).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is equal to the product of the complement of the baseline probability (1 - 0.15) and the witness's error rate (0.2):

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = (1 - 0.15) * 0.2 = 0.16

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

The first term on the right-hand side is the witness's accuracy rate (0.8). The second term is the baseline probability (0.15). The third term is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller in both cases (attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is shorter than 185 cm):

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.16 * 0.85) = 0.184

Substituting all the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.184 â‰ˆ 0.652

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.652.
