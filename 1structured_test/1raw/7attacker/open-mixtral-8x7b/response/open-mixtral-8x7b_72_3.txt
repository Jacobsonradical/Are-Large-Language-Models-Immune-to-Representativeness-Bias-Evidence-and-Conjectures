To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller, i.e., the witness says 185 cm or taller for someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm)

We need one more piece of information: P(B). To find this, we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80)*(0.15) + (0.20)*(0.85)
= 0.120 + 0.170
= 0.290

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [(0.80)*(0.15)] / (0.290)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
