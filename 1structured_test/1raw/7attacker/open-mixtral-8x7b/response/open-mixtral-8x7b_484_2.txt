To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's accuracy and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(~B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(A|B): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A|~B): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~B) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies height incorrectly 20% of the time)

We want to estimate: P(A|B)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to compute P(B|A):
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness always identifies it correctly as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875

The answer is: {probability: 0.1875}
