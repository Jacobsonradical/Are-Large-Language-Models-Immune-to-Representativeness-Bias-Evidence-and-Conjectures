To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. We are told that the witness correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (i.e., identifies people as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time.

Let's denote being 185 cm or taller as event A and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as event B. From the problem statement, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to estimate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have all the terms on the right-hand side of the equation, except for P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
