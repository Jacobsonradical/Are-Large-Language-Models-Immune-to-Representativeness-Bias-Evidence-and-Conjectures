To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's first calculate the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15 in the problem statement.

Next, we need to compute the likelihood of observing the evidence (the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) under each hypothesis. This involves two cases:
1. The attacker's actual height is 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness will correctly identify the height 80% of the time, so the likelihood is 0.8.
2. The attacker's actual height is less than 185 cm. In this case, the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time, so the likelihood is 0.2.

Now, Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (our updated estimate) is equal to the product of the prior probability, likelihood, and the normalizing constant (which ensures the sum of probabilities equals 1). The formula is:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

where:
- A denotes the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- ~A denotes the complementary event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm,
- E denotes the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller,
- P(A) is the prior probability,
- P(~A) is the prior probability of the complementary event (1 - P(A)),
- P(E|A) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and
- P(E|~A) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
