To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller (from the city statistics, this is 0.15)
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall (from the witness reliability data, this is 0.8)
P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they are not (also from the witness reliability data, this is 0.2)
P(not A) is the prior probability that a random person is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(not B|not A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.8

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting in our values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

However, since we are asked to provide an answer strictly between 0 and 1, I will provide the final answer without rounding:

{probability: 0.413793103}
