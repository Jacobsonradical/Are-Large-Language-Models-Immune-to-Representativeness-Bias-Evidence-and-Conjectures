To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution in the city.

Let's define our probabilities:

- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. We know from the problem statement that P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We know from the problem statement that P(B) = 0.8 (when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
- P(¬B): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We know from the problem statement that P(¬B) = 0.2 (when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We already have the values of P(A), P(B), and P(¬B). Let's find P(B|¬A):

P(B|¬A) = The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this is the same as the false positive rate of the witness: P(¬A) * P(B|¬A) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

Now we can find P(B|¬A): P(B|¬A) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.8 * 0.15) ≈ 0.03 / 0.158 ≈ 0.1899

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1899) ≈ 0.72

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.72 (or 72%).
