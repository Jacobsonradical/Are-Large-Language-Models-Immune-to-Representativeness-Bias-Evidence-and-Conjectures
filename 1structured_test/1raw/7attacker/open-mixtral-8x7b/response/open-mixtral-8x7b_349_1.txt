To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability we're looking for as P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

where:
- P(W|A) is the probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W) is the probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller.

We're given that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We're given that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(W|not A), we need to use the witness's error rate. Since the witness erred 20% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, we can assume that 20% of their "successes" were actually errors. Therefore, P(W|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

Finally, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205
= 0.1220779220779221

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.122.

Answer: {probability: 0.122}
