To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate P(B) which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
