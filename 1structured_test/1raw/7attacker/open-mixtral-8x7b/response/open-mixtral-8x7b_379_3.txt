To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We are also given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the two scenarios.

Scenario 1 (attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm):
- True positive rate: 80%
- Probability: 15% * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%)

Scenario 2 (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
- False positive rate: 20%
- Probability: 85% * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities for each scenario:

Scenario 1: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.4118 (or 41.18%)

Scenario 2: P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.17 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.5882 (or 58.82%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 41.18%.

{probability: 0.4118}
