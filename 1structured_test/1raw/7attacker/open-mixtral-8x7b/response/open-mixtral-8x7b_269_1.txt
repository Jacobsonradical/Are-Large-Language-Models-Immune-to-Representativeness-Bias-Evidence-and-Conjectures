To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to point b.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to point a.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.8 according to point a.
- P(A') as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
- P(B|A') as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to point a.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'))

Substituting the values we have:
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Calculating this expression yields:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
