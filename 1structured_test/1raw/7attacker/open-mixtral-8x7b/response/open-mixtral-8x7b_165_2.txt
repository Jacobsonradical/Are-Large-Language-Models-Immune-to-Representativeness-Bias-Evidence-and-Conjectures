Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We have P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 (from the information given), P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we need to find P(Witness). To calculate P(Witness), we need to consider both the correct identifications and the errors made by the witness.

P(Witness) = P(Witness and Tall) + P(Witness and Not Tall)
= P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
