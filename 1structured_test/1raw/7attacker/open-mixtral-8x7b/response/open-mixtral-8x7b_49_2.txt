To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "15% are 185 cm or taller". This means that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is also 0.15, assuming that the population distribution applies to the attacker as well.

However, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which increases the likelihood that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, and the witness's error rate is 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B),

where P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8), P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A),

where P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (which is 0.85), and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2, since the witness erroneously identifies 20% of people who are not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
