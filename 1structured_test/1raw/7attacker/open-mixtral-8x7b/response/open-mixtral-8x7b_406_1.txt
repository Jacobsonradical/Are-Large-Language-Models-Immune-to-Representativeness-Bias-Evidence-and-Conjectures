To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We are given:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8
2. P(W|A') = 0.2
3. P(A') = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A) = P(W) * P(A|W) / P(W)

The law of total probability states that:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Now, we can calculate P(A):
P(A) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')]
= [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

However, we don't have P(A) initially. To solve this, let's assume that P(A) is x. Then, we can rewrite the above equation as:
x = [0.8 * x] / [0.8 * x + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now, let's solve for x:
0.8x - 0.8x^2 = 0.17x
0.8x^2 - 0.8x = -0.17x
0.8x^2 - 1.87x = 0
x^2 - 2.3375x = 0
x (x - 2.3375) = 0

x = 0 or x = 2.3375

Since the probability should be between 0 and 1, we take x = 2.3375 as the upper bound and take the conservative estimate:

{probability: 0.8 (80%), since x = P(A) and 0.8 is the closest probability value below the upper bound}
