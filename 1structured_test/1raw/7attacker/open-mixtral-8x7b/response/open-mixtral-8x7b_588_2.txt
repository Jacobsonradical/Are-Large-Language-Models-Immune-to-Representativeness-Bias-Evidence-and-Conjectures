To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
