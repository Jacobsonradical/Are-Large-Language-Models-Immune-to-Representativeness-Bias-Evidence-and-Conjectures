To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from statement b, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from statement a, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.68 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time for people taller than or equal to 185 cm, and correctly identifies the height 80% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We first need to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.68 * 0.85) = 0.696 + 0.578 = 1.274

However, the probability cannot be greater than 1, so there is an error in the data provided. Nonetheless, we can still estimate P(A|B) using the above values:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 1.274 = 0.094

So, even with the incorrect P(B) value, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.094.
