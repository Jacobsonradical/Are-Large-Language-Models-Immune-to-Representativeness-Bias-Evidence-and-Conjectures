To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find:
P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Next, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17] = 0.3158 or approximately 31.58%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.3158}
