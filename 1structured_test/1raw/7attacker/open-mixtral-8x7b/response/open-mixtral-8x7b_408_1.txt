To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability rule:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given the information, we have:
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

For the second term, we need the probability that a witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the complement of the witness being correct, so P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We also need the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.
