To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence.

Here, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height when it's 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on city population statistics)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying the height when it's less than 185 cm)
P(not H) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being less than 185 cm, based on city population statistics)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Substituting the given values:
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
