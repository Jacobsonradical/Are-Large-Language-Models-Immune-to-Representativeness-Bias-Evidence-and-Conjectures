Let's analyze the information given:

a. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This implies that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

To find this probability, we can use the formula:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness erroneously identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from a)
P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.85
P(witness erroneously identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (from b)

Substituting the given values into the formula:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.29}.
