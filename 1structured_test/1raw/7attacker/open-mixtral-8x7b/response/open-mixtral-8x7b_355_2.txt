To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller." So, the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, we need to account for the fact that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and that the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases. So, we multiply the base rate (0.15) by the witness's accuracy (0.8), resulting in a probability of 0.12 or 12% that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.12}
