To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller". We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, let's calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Next, we can calculate P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.245

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.245 ≈ 0.486

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.486 (48.6%).
