To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller in the sample given to the witness, this means that the base rate (prior probability) of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (or 50%).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.5 (prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find:
- P(A|B) (posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:
- ¬A is the event that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A) is the prior probability of ¬A, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.5
- P(B|¬A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (or 67%).
