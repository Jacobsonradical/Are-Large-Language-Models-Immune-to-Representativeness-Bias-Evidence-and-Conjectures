To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to calculate P(A' ), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that P(A') = 0.85.

Next, we'll calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
