To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4537

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4537 or 45.37%.
