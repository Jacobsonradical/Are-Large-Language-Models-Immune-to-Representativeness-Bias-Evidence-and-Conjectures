To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information (b).

P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the given information (a).

P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 according to the given information (a).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given that P(A) = 0.15 and P(B|A) = 0.8. We also need to find P(not A), which is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we need to find P(B|not A):

If 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, then the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not, so P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445) = 0.12 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4541

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4541}
