To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy. We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a 80% accuracy rate. We need to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given these conditions.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm: P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
