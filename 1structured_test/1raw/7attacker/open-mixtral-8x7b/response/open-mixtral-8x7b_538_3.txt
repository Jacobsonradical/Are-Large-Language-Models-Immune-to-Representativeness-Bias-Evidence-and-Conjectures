To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population (part a) and then adjust that probability based on the witness's accuracy (part b).

Let's start by calculating the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population:
P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = Percentage of people 185 cm or taller
= 15% + (0.5 * 85%) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 85% / 2 or 0.5 * 85% are closer to 185 cm)
= 15% + 42.5%
= 57.5%

Now, let's adjust this probability based on the witness's accuracy:
P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) * P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 57.5%
= 46%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.46, or 46%}
