To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability we want to find) is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior probability.

First, let's determine the prior probability, which is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(tall) = 0.15
