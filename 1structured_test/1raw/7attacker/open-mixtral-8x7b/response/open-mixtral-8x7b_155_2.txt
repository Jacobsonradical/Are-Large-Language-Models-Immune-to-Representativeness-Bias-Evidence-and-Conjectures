To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct and the person is 185 cm or taller, or the witness is incorrect and the person is shorter than 185 cm. So,

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
