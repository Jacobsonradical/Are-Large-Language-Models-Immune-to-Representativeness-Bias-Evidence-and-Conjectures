To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

The witness correctly identified people who were 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and they erred 20% of the time. Since the population is split evenly between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can create a conditional probability table:

P(Witness identifies taller | Actual height is taller) = 0.8
P(Witness identifies taller | Actual height is not taller) = 0.2
P(Actual height is taller) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)

Now, we want to find P(Actual height is taller | Witness identifies taller). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability:

P(Actual height is taller | Witness identifies taller) = (P(Witness identifies taller | Actual height is taller) * P(Actual height is taller)) / P(Witness identifies taller)

To find P(Witness identifies taller), we can use the law of total probability:
P(Witness identifies taller) = P(Witness identifies taller | Actual height is taller) * P(Actual height is taller) + P(Witness identifies taller | Actual height is not taller) * P(Actual height is not taller)

Now, we can calculate the final probability:
P(Actual height is taller | Witness identifies taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.5294

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5294}
