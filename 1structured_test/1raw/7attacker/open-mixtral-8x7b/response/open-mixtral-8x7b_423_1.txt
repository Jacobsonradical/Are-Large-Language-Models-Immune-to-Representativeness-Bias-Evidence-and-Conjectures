To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population:
P(A ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:
P(W | A ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker's true height:
P(A ≥ 185 cm | W) = P(W | A ≥ 185 cm) \* P(A ≥ 185 cm) / P(W)

To find P(W), we need to calculate the probabilities of the witness identifying a person as either shorter or taller than 185 cm:

* P(W and A < 185 cm) = P(W | A < 185 cm) \* P(A < 185 cm) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17
* P(W and A ≥ 185 cm) = P(W | A ≥ 185 cm) \* P(A ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, P(W) = P(W and A < 185 cm) + P(W and A ≥ 185 cm) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(A ≥ 185 cm | W) = P(W | A ≥ 185 cm) \* P(A ≥ 185 cm) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
