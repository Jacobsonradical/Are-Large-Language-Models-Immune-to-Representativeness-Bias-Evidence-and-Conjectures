To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the problem description, we have:
P(H) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(E|H) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

First, calculate P(not H):
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(E):
P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So,
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4138}.
