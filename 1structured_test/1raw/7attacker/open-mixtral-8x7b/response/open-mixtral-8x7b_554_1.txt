To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(E|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15%).
- P(E|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.2 (20%).

We need to find P(E), which is the probability of the evidence, i.e., the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as follows:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
