To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the observation of the witness.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the probability of observing the witness report, given everyone in the population. To calculate this, we need to consider both the true positive rate (P(B|A)) and the false positive rate (P(B|not A)).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are not given the false positive rate P(B|not A) directly, but we can derive it using the complementary probability:
P(not B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A)

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, we have:
P(not B|not A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time)

So,
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness report:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
