Let's analyze the information given.

85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller.

A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Now, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B be "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We know the following probabilities:
- P(A): 15% or 0.15
- P(B|A): 80% or 0.8
- P(B|¬A): 20% or 0.2 (¬A signifies the contrary of A, that is, the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B): We need to calculate this value, which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29 or 29%

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138 or 41.38%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.
