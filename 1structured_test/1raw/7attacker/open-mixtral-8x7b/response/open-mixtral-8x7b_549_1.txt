To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.5 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so the false positive rate is 20%, and the probability of observing B when ¬A occurs is 1 - false positive rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.5)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425

Finally, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.425) = 0.12 / 0.545 ≈ 0.22

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.22 (22%).
