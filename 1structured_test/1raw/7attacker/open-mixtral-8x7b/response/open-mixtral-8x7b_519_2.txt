To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We'll calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the two scenarios: the witness is correct and the witness is not correct.

1. Witness is correct:
P(185 cm or taller | Witness correct) = P(Witness correct | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

2. Witness is not correct:
P(185 cm or taller | Witness not correct) = P(Witness not correct | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.16

Now we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using the law of total probability.
P(185 cm or taller) = P(185 cm or taller | Witness correct) * P(Witness correct) + P(185 cm or taller | Witness not correct) * P(Witness not correct)

We know that P(Witness correct) = 0.8 and P(Witness not correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, so:

P(185 cm or taller) = (0.12 * 0.8) + (0.16 * 0.2) = 0.096 + 0.032 = 0.128

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.128 or 12.8%.
