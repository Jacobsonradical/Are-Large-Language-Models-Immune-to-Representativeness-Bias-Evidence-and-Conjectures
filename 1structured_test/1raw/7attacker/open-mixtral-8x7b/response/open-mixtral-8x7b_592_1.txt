To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|not A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we find:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.0255)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.8256 (or 82.56% if expressed as a percentage)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8256}
