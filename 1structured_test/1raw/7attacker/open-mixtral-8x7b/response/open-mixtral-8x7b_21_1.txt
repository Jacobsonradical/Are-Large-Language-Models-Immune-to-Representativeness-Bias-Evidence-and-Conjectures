To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and H represent the evidence provided by the witness.

We are interested in P(A|H), the probability of A given H.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|H) = P(H|A) * P(A) / [P(H|A) * P(A) + P(H|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(H|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies A 80% of the time)
- P(H|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies not A as A 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(A|H) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
