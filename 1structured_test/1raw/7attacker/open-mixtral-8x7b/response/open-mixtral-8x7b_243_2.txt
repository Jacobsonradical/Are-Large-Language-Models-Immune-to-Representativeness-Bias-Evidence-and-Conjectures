To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population. Then, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the new evidence provided by the witness.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller:

P(WitnessCorrect) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population:

P(185+ cm) = 0.15

Now, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:

P(185+ cm | Witness identifies 185+ cm) = (P(Witness identifies 185+ cm | 185+ cm) * P(185+ cm)) / P(Witness identifies 185+ cm)

To calculate the denominator, P(Witness identifies 185+ cm), we need to account for both the true and false positive rates of the witness's identification:

P(Witness identifies 185+ cm) = P(Witness identifies 185+ cm | 185+ cm) * P(185+ cm) + P(Witness identifies 185+ cm | <185 cm) * P(<185 cm)

P(Witness identifies 185+ cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:

P(185+ cm | Witness identifies 185+ cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
