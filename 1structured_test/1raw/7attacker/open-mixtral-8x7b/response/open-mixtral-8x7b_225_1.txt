To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(a person is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies a 185 cm or taller person correctly) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not) = 20% = 0.2 (¬A is the complementary event of not being 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = P(a person is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to 0.414 when expressed as a percentage)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
