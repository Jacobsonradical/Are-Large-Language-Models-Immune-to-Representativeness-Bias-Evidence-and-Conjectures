To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and erroneously identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy. Therefore, P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(E|not A) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A). Substituting the values we have calculated so far, we get P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E) using Bayes' theorem, which gives us P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
