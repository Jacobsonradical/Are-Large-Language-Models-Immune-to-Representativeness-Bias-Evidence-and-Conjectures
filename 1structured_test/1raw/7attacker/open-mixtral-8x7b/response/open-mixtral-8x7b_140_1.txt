To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = P(the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
Note: ¬A is the event "the attacker is not 185 cm or taller" or equivalently "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to find P(¬A). Since P(A) = 0.15, it means that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population).

Then, we need to find P(B|¬A). This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is given as 20% in the question.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
