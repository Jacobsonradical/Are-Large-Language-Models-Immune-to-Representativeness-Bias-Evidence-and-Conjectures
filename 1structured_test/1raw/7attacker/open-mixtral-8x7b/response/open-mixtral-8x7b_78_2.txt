To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information given:
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Let's compute:
- P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) = 0.12
- P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2)(0.85) = 0.17
- P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
