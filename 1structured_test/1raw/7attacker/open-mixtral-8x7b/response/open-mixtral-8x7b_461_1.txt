To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such

From the given information, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We're given P(B|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). To find P(B|not A), we can use the complementary probability that the witness makes an error: P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can estimate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
