To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
