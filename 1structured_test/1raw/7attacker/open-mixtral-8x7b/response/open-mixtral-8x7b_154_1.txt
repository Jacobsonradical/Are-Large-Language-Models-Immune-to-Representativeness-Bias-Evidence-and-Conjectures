To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let P(A) be the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the person is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4545

Given the available information, there is approximately a 45.45% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
