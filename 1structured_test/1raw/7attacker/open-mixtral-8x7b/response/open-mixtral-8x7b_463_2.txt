To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- D: the evidence from the witness that the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)

However, we also need to know P(D|not H), the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not. We can find this using the complement probability:

P(D|not H) = 1 - P(not D|not H)
= 1 - 0.8 (because the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not tall)
= 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not H) * P(not H)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.36

So, based on the given information, there's approximately a 36% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
