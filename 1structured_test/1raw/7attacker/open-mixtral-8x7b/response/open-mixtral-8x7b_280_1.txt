To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this background information as P(B).

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, and they erred 20% of the time. We can denote this as P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the population statistics. In this case, P(A|B) = 0.8 and P(¬A|B) = 0.2 (¬A represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We need to find P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller regardless of the population statistics. We can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)

We know P(A|B) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). However, we don't have the value of P(A|¬B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that they are not in this group. Since the witness's accuracy is 80%, this means P(A|¬B) = 0.2 (20% of the time the witness errs by saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not). We also know that P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)
P(A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(A) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)
P(B|A) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
P(B|A) ≈ 0.345

However, this value is not a probability between 0 and 1 for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. It represents the probability that the witness's identification is correct, given the population statistics.

To directly calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's accuracy:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 0.8

So, our answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
