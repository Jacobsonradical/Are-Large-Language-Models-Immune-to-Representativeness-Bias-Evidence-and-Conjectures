To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given these probabilities in the problem statement.

We also need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies any attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such (with probability P(B|A)P(A)), or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (with probability P(B|Ac)P(Ac), where Ac denotes the complementary event of A).

We are given P(A)=0.15, P(B|A)=0.8, and P(B|Ac)=0.2. We need to calculate P(Ac), the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(Ac)=0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|Ac)P(Ac)=(0.8)(0.15)+(0.2)(0.85)=0.18+0.17=0.35.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such: P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)=(0.8)(0.15)/0.35=0.12/0.35=0.343 (rounded to three decimal places).

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.343}.
