To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. We can calculate it using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

First, let's find P(E|A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. So, P(E|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Based on the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(E): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is a weighted sum of the probabilities for people shorter than 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)

We already have P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. For P(E|not A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time. So, P(E|not A) = 0.2. And, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Putting this all together, we find:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
