To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to the city's population data.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|not A), it is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the complement of the witness correctly identifying the height, so it's 20% (100% - 80%). The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85%.

Now we calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to 0.41)

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
