To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given:
1. P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(E|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8*0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
