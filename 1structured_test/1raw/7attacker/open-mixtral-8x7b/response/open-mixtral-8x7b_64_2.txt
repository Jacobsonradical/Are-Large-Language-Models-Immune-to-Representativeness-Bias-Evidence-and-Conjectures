To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
≈ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
