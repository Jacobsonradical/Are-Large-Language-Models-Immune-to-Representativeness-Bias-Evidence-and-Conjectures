To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define our terms:

H = height of the attacker is 185 cm or taller
D = witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(H) = 15% (a)
P(D|H) = 80% (b) because the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
P(D|not H) = 50% because the witness has a 50-50 chance of guessing correctly whether the person is 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not H) * P(not H)]

First, calculate P(not H):
P(not H) = 100% - 15% = 85%

Next, calculate P(D|not H):
Since the witness has a 50-50 chance of guessing correctly, P(D|not H) = 0.5 * 0.85 + 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.525

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(H|D) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.525 * 0.85)] = 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.44625) = 0.2925 or 29.25%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 29.25%.
