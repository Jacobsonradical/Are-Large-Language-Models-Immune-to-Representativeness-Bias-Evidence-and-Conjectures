To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided by the witness.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We have been given the following probabilities:
1. P(A): 15% or 0.15 (from clause b)
2. P(B|A): 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B'): 20% or 0.2 (the witness's error in identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm)
4. P(A'): 85% or 0.85 (from clause b, this is the complementary probability of P(A))

However, we don't have P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find this, we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A').

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
