To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and B (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller). We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (which we know is 0.8 from above)
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the product of P(!A), the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85), and P(B|!A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying such a person as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2, since the witness errs 20% of the time).

So, P(B) = 0.8 (from B|A) + 0.85 * 0.2 (from !A and B|!A) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.1237

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.1237.
