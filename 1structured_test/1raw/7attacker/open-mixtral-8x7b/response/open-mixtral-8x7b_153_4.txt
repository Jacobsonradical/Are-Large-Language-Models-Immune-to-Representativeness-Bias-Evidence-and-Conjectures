To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are asked to find P(H|E), the probability of H being true given the observed evidence E.

We have two pieces of information that can help us calculate this probability:
1. P(E|H), the probability of observing evidence E if hypothesis H is true. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
2. P(H), the prior probability of hypothesis H being true. This is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

However, we also need to account for the false positive rate, which is the probability of observing evidence E when hypothesis H is not true. This is given as 20%, or 0.2. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of hypothesis ~H (not H) is 0.85. Therefore, the false positive rate is P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8)]
= 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.16)
= 0.09 / 0.25
= 0.36

So the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.36 or 36%.
