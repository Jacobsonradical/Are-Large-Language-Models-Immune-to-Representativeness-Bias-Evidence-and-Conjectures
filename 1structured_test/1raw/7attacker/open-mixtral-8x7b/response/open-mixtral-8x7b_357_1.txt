To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:
P(A) = P(The attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(The witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80% success rate)
P(B|¬A) = P(The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = P(The attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, by using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability we are interested in, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
