To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the overall accuracy of the witness. They correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Therefore, the overall accuracy of the witness is:

0.8 * 0.5 (correct identification of people who are 185 cm or taller) + 0.2 * 0.5 (incorrect identification of people who are not 185 cm or taller) = 0.6

Now, let's use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's accuracy to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller) + 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

But, since the witness's overall accuracy is 0.6, we need to adjust our estimate using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We know that:

* P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from above)
* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the problem statement)
* P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.6 (from the witness's overall accuracy)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.6 = 0.2

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
