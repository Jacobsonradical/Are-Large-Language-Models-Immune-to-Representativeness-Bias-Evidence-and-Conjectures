To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., the witness says 185 cm or taller, but the person is actually shorter), which is 20% or 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) * P(A) ] / [ P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) ]

The probability that a person is NOT 185 cm or taller, P(¬A), is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:
P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) * P(A) ] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
