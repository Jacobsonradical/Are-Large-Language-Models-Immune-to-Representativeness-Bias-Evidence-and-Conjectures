To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From the witness's testimony, we know that when presented with a sample of people with half being shorter than 185 cm and half being 185 cm or taller, they correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that the witness agrees with the true height 80% of the time and disagrees with the true height 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the two possible outcomes when comparing the witness's testimony with the actual height of the attacker:

1. The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct (true positive).
2. The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, but they are wrong (false positive).

We want to find P(A), so we need to determine the probability of a true positive. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, our events are:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the witness's testimony, we have P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).

From the population distribution, we know that P(A) is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible outcomes (true positive and false positive) and their probabilities. The probability of a true positive is P(B∩A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of a false positive is P(B∩¬A) = P(B|¬A) * P(¬A), where ¬A is the event that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(¬A) = 0.85, and P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%. So, P(B∩¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B∩A) + P(B∩¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
