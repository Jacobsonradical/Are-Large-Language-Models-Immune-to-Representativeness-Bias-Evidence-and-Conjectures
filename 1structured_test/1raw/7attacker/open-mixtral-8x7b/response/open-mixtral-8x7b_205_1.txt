To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness's statement and the error rate of the witness.

First, we know that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time, the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the case we are interested in. Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time in this scenario, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller as follows:

probability = true positive rate = probability of correct identification
= 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
