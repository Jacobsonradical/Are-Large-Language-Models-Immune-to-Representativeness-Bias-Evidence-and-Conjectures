To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (E). In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the observed evidence (E) is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Let's break down the terms:

1. P(E|H) is the probability of observing the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller) given that the hypothesis is true (the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, P(E|H) = 0.8.
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true, which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15.
3. P(E) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of observing the evidence for all possible heights of the attacker. This can be expressed as P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H represents the complementary hypothesis (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.
4. To calculate P(E|~H), the probability of observing the evidence given that the complementary hypothesis is true, we need to consider the witness's error rate. The witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm. However, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a higher chance that the witness will mistakenly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The exact value of P(E|~H) depends on the witness's error rate and the distribution of heights in the population.

To simplify the calculation, let's assume that the witness's error rate is the same (20%) for both identifying someone as 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm. This assumption might not be entirely accurate, but it allows for an approximate calculation.

With this assumption, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Thus, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.217.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.217 ≈ 0.5527.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.55 (55%).
