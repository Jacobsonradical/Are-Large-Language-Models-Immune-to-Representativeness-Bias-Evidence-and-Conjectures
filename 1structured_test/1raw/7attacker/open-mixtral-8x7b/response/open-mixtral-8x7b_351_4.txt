To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - either the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 17% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4535}
