To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the data provided, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios - when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and when it's not. We are given the probabilities for these scenarios:

Scenario 1: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
Probability = P(A) = 0.15
Given this probability, the witness will identify the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, and incorrectly as shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.2.

Scenario 2: Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
Probability = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
Given this probability, the witness will identify the attacker incorrectly as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2, and correctly as shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.8.

The combined probability P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
