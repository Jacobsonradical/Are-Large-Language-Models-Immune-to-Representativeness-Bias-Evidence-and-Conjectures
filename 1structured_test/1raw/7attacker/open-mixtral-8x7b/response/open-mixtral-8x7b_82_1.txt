To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the question, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = P(being 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
