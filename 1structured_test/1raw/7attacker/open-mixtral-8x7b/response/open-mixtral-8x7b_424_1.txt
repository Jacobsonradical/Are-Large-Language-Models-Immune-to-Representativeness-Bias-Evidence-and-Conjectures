To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is NOT 185 cm or taller)
3. P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
4. P(A) + P(A') = 1 (attacker's height is either 185 cm or taller, or NOT 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

We don't have enough information to compute P(A), but we can use the symmetry of the problem to make an educated guess. Since the witness has a 20% error rate, they are equally likely to make an error in either direction. Therefore, we can assume that:
P(A) ≈ P(C) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))] ≈ 0.5789

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5789}
