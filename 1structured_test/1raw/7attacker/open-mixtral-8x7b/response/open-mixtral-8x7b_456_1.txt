To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.144 + 0.137 = 0.281

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.281 â‰ˆ 0.391

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.391}
