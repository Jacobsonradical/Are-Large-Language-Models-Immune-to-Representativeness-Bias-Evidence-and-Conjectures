To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* B: The witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

First, let's compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
