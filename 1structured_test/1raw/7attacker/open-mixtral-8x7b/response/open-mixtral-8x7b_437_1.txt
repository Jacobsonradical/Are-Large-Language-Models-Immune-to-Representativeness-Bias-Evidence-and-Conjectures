To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = P(the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

We need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.16)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.28
P(A|B) = 0.428571429 (approximately 43% if rounded to a percentage)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.428571429}
