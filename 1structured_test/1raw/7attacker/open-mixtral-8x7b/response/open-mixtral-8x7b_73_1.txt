To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate, which is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller:

base_rate = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time.

sensitivity = 0.8
false_alarm = 0.2

Using these values, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

posterior = (base_rate * sensitivity) / ((base_rate * sensitivity) + ((1 - base_rate) * false_alarm))

posterior = (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2))

posterior = 0.12 / 0.255

posterior = 0.46651162790697674

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.47, rounded to two decimal places}
