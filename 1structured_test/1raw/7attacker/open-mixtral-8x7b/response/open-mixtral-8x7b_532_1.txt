To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the witness's ability to judge height and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height under similar conditions to the night of the attack. We know that the witness correctly identified the height of a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume that the attacker is a random person from this city population. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge height to update our prior beliefs based on the population statistics.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's 80% accuracy rate. So, P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is equal to the witness's 20% error rate. So, P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says 185 cm or taller)

We know P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 based on the given information. To find P(witness says 185 cm or taller), we need to calculate the total probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller for each possible height category, weighted by the probability of each height category.

P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) + P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.17 + 0.12
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
