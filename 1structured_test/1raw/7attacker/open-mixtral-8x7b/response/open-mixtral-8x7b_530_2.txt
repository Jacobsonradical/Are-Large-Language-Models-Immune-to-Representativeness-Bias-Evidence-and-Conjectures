To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

From the problem statement, we are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(not B|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 1 - P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to find P(B|not A). Since the witness is only asked to identify people 185 cm or taller, and the witness never identifies people as taller when they are not, then:

P(B|not A) = 0 (there is no chance of the witness identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

So, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.68}
