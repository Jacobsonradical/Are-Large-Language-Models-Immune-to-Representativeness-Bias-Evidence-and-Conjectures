To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies this) and the false positives (the cases where the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such). 

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
