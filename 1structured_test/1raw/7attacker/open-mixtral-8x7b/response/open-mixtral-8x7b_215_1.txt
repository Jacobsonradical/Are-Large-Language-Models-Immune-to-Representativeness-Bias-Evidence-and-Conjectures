To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from statement b).
- P(B) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8 (from statement a).
- P(A|B) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that they are identified as such by the witness.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of probabilities, taking into account both the true height and the possibility of the witness being wrong.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3571, or 35.71%.
