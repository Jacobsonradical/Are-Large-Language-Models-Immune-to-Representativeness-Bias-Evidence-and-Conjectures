To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm
- P(S): probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm
- P(T): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller

We have the following information:
P(B|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
P(B|S) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy)
P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(T) = 1 - P(S) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(T|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(T|B) = P(B|T) * P(T) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as follows:

P(B) = P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|S) * P(S)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(T|B):

P(T|B) = P(B|T) * P(T) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
