To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): the attacker's height was not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|B): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(SH): probability of a randomly chosen person from the city's population being shorter than 185 cm
- P(185+): probability of a randomly chosen person from the city's population being 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|B) = 0.2
- P(SH) = 0.85
- P(185+) = 1 - P(SH) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
- P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B))

To find an estimate for P(A), we can solve the above equation for P(A). However, to do this, we need values for P(W|A) * P(A) and P(W|B) * P(B), which are probabilities of the witness's correct and incorrect identifications, respectively.

- P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A)
- P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B))
0.2 * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

We can now solve this equation numerically for P(A). After solving, we get:

P(A) â‰ˆ 0.2353

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2353}
