To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs based on evidence. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence. We are interested in finding P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From (a), we are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy, so P(B|A) = 0.8. This also means that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a 20% chance, which implies that P(¬B|A) = 0.2, where ¬B is the event that the witness does not identify the person as 185 cm or taller. By the law of total probability, P(¬B) = P(¬B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A), and we are given P(¬B) = 0.15 (from (b)) and P(¬B|¬A) = 1 (the witness will always identify a shorter person correctly).

Now, we can find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the law of total probability equation, we have:

0.15 = (0.2 * P(A)) + (1 * 0.85 * (1-P(A)))

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.125

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.125.
