To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 150 cm. Using the law of total probability, we get:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| ~A) * P(~A)
where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(~A) = 0.85, and P(B| ~A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(B| ~A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.8)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.80

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.80 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.12}
