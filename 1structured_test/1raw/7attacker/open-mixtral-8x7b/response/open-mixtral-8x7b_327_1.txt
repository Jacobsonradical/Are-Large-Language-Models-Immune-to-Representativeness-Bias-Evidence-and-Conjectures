To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city. We will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, let's calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / 0.29 = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
