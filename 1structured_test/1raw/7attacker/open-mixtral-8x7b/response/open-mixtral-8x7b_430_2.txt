To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can calculate it as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have the following information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (8.5% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies the height, or the attacker is shorter and the witness makes an error. So,

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|not A), it's the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (making an error 20% of the time). And P(not A) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided is approximately 0.345.
