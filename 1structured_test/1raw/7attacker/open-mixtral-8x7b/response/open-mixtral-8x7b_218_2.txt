To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the given information, 15% of the population is in scenario 1, and 85% is in scenario 2.

The witness said that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is reliable 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is:

P(185 cm | witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness statement)

To calculate this, we first need to determine the probability of the witness making a correct statement:

P(witness statement | 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

The probability of the witness making an incorrect statement (when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is:

P(witness statement | < 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.3 (witness errs 20% of the time, and the attacker is in scenario 2 with a probability of 0.5)

Finally, we need to calculate the overall probability of the witness making the statement:

P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(witness statement | < 185 cm) * P(< 185 cm)
P(witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.24 + 0.255 = 0.495

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm | witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness statement)
P(185 cm | witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.495 â‰ˆ 0.2424

The answer is:
{probability: 0.2424}
