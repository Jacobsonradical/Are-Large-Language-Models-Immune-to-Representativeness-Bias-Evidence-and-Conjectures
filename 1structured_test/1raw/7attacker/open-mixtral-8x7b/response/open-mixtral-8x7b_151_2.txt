To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population data.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population.
- P(W|T): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|¬T): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

From the given information, we know that P(T) = 0.15, P(W|T) = 0.8, and P(W|¬T) = 0.2.

We are interested in finding P(T|W), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(T|W) as follows:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|¬T) * P(¬T)]

First, let's calculate P(¬T):
P(¬T) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
