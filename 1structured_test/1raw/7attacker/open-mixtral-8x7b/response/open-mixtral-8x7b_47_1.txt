To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness correctly identifies the height (event A is true) or the witness incorrectly identifies the height (event A is false). 

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
