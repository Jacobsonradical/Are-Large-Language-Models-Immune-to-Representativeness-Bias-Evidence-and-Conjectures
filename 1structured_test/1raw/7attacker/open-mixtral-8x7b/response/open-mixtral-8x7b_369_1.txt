To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(T) + P(S) = 1
P(S) = 1 - P(T)

We are also given the following probabilities:
P(W|T) = 0.8 (probability of witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller)
P(W|S) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find: P(T|W)

Using Bayes' theorem,
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

Now, let's calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W ∩ (T ∪ S))
P(W) = P(W ∩ T) + P(W ∩ S)
P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)

Now, substitute P(W) into Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / (P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S))
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / (P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * (1 - P(T)))

Given that we don't have specific numbers, we can't find the exact probability. Instead, let's reason through this problem step by step.

1. Since 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies people as 185 cm or taller, the likelihood that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness identification is higher than if the witness randomly guessed.
2. Given the city's population, the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, but the witness's identification increases the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller can be estimated as a weighted average of the prior probability (population distribution) and the likelihood (witness identification).
4. Since the witness is more likely to be correct than incorrect (0.8 vs. 0.2), the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller should be higher than the prior probability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, P(T|W), to be somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8, with a higher likelihood towards 0.8.

Answer: {probability: 0.65, please note that this is an estimate and can vary based on specific values for P(T)}.
