To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = probability of the witness correctly identifying the height, which is 0.80.
P(A) = probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% from statement b).
P(B|not A) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height, which is 0.20 (20% from statement a).
P(not A) = probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% from statement b).
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
