To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Let's define:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are (80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (20%)
- P(not A) as the probability that a random person in the city is not 185 cm or taller (85%)
- P(A|B) is the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the terms inside the brackets:

P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Then, divide:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
