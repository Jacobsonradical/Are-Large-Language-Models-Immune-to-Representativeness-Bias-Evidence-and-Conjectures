To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "15% are 185 cm or taller". So, P(T) = 0.15, where T denotes the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or P(W|T) = 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2, or P(W|S) = 0.2, where S denotes the event that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, or P(T|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / (P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|S) \* P(S))

We know P(W|T) = 0.8, P(T) = 0.15, P(W|S) = 0.2, and P(S) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). Plugging in these values, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
P(T|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(T|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.41}. This means that, based on the given information, there is a 41% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
