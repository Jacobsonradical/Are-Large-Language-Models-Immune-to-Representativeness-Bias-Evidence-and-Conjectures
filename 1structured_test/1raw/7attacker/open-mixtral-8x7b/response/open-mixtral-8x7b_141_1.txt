To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let's break down the information given:

P(A) is the prior probability that a random person in the city has a height of 185 cm or taller. According to (b), P(A) = 15%.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to (a), P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8.

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller. According to (a), P(B|not A) = 20% or 0.2.

P(not A) is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. According to (b), P(not A) = 85%.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 (or 37.5%).
