To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
P(E) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's true height

Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, we have:
P(A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, let's calculate P(B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability using conditional probabilities:

P(B | A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B | not A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's true height:

P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A | B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
