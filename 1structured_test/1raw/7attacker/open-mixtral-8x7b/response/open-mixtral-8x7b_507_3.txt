To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the fact that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, meaning they say the person is 185 cm or taller when they are not)
4. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(0.8)(0.15)] / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
