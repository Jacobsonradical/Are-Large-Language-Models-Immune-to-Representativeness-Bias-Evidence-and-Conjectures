To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the two pieces of information, we have:

P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population statistics.

P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

P(B|¬A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter, which is 20% or 0.2 based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

P(¬A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the city's population statistics.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
