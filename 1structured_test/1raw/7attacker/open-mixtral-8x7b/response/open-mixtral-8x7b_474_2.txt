To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (20% or 0.2)
- P(not A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is NOT 185 cm or taller (85% or 0.85)
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification (which we want to estimate)

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the above expression:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4545}
