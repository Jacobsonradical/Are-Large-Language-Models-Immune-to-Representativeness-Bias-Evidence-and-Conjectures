To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (the population statistics)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the actual height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness's error rate when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm)

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to find P(¬A) first, which is the complementary probability of A:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate the denominator of Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.205 + 0.17 = 0.375

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 ≈ 0.32

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.32.
