To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(A|B), we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

However, since P(B) is an approximation based on the provided data, the final answer should also be considered an approximation:

{probability: 0.345, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
