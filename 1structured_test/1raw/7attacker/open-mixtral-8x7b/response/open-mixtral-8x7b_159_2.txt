To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(T|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(T|A') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller.
- P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(T|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
3. P(T|A') = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we want to find P(A|T), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller GIVEN that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|T) = (P(T|A) * P(A)) / (P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|A') * P(A'))

First, calculate P(T|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
Next, calculate P(T|A') * P(A') = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now, add the two results:

P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, compute P(A|T):

P(A|T) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
