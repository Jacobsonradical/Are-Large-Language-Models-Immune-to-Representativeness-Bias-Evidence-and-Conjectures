To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
