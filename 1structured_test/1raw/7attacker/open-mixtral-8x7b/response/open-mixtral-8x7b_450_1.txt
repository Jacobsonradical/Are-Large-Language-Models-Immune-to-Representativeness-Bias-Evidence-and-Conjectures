Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote the two hypotheses as:
H1: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
H2: The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know that P(H1) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(H2) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

We also know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Therefore, we can denote the sensitivity (true positive rate) as TPR = 0.8 and the false positive rate as FPR = 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to compute the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given by the posterior probability P(H1|E), where E is the evidence of the witness's identification.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) \* P(H1) / P(E)

We can compute P(E|H1) as the true positive rate TPR = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To compute P(E|H2), we need to consider the false positive rate FPR = 0.2, since the witness erred in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller.

We can compute P(E) as the sum of the probabilities of E given both hypotheses, weighted by their prior probabilities:

P(E) = P(E|H1) \* P(H1) + P(E|H2) \* P(H2)

Putting it all together, we get:

P(H1|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.5797101449275362}

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 57.97%.
