To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution in the city.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken.

Next, let's consider the population distribution. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:

* P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
* P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35)
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.80)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.3429

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3429.
