To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and W (the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller). We are interested in P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.5 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Here, ¬A represents the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are now ready to calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.1565

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1565 or 15.65%.
