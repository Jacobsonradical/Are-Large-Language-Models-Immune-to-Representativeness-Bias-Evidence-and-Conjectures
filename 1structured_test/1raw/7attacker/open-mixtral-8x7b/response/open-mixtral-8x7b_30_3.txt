To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (Hypothesis H) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (Evidence E).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

From the given information, we have:
P(H) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(E|H) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

P(E|H') = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

P(E) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H')
= (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*(1-0.15))
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
= (0.8*0.15) / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3571 (or 35.71%).
