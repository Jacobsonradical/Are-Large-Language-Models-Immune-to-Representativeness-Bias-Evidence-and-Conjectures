To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in two steps. First, we use the city's population statistics to estimate the probability of encountering an attacker who is 185 cm or taller. Second, we adjust this probability based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Step 1: According to the given information, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population, is 0.15.

Step 2: Now, we need to account for the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This implies that the witness correctly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as such 80% of the time as well.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider both possibilities: the witness could have identified a person who is actually 185 cm or taller, or the witness could have identified a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker who is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from Step 1) multiplied by 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate), which equals 0.12.

The probability of the witness identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 (probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm) multiplied by 0.2 (the witness's error rate), which equals 0.17.

Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, accounting for the witness's ability to judge a person's height, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
