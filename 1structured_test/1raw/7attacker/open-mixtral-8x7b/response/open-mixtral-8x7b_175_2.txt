To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (80%) and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%).

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

where A' is the complement of event A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) and:
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(W|A') = 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)

Now, calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
