To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the question, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time when they aren't. This gives us:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a tall person as tall)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a short person as tall)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]. 

Substituting in our values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
