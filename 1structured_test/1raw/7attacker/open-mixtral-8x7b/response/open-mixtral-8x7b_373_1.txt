Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Given these conditions, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to estimate the probability that this identification is correct.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case would be:

P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness identifies as 185cm+) = P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is 185cm+) * P(Attacker is 185cm+)

We are given:
P(Attacker is 185cm+) = 0.15 (15%)
P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is 185cm+) = 0.8 (80%)

However, we also need to account for the times when the witness is incorrect, i.e., the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185cm+ when they are not. This is:

P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is not 185cm+) = 1 - P(Witness identifies as not 185cm+ | Attacker is not 185cm+)
= 1 - 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person as not 185cm+ 80% of the time)
= 0.2 (20%)

Now, we need to calculate the total probability of the witness identifying a person as 185cm+, which is:

P(Witness identifies as 185cm+) = P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is 185cm+) * P(Attacker is 185cm+) + P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is not 185cm+) * P(Attacker is not 185cm+)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185cm+ given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness identifies as 185cm+) = P(Witness identifies as 185cm+ | Attacker is 185cm+) * P(Attacker is 185cm+) / P(Witness identifies as 185cm+)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.41}
