To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
= 0.4545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545 or 45.45%.
