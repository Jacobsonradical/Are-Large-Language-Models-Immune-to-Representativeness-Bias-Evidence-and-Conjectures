To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city.

Let's denote:

* P(tall) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
* P(witness|tall) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as tall given that the person is actually tall.
* P(witness|short) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as tall given that the person is actually short.

We are given:

* P(tall) = 15% = 0.15
* P(witness|tall) = 80% = 0.8
* P(witness|short) = 20% = 0.2

To find the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's identification, we need to calculate the posterior probability P(tall|witness). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(tall|witness) = P(witness|tall) \* P(tall) / P(witness)

We can calculate P(witness) using the law of total probability:

P(witness) = P(witness|tall) \* P(tall) + P(witness|short) \* P(short)

P(witness) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(tall|witness) = P(witness|tall) \* P(tall) / P(witness) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
