To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to (a).
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 according to (b).
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2 according to (b).
- P(not A) as the probability that a person in the city is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85 according to (a).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in our values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
