To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that:
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the given information)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that:
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (from the given information)
- P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Substituting these values, we get:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.3429 (approximately)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3429}
