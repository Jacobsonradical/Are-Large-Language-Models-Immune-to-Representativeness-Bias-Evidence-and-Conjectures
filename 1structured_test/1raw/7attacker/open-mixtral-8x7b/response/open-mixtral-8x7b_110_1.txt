To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.50 (the witness randomly guesses the height 50% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.50 * 0.85 = 0.425

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + 0.425]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.1613

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1613, or 16.13%.
