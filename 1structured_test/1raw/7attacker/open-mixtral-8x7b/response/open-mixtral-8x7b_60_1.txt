To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we are given:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such) = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(!A) = P(the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population)
P(B|!A) = P(the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
