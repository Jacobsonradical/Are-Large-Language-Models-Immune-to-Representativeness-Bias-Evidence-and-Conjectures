To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find P(A=attacker is 185 cm or taller | B=witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
1. P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 0.80
2. P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15
3. P(B|~A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is NOT actually 185 cm or taller = 0.20 (complementary probability)
4. P(~A): Probability that a person is NOT 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.85 (complementary probability)
5. We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
   P(B) = (0.80*0.15) + (0.20*0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80*0.15) / 0.35
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.35
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.34 (34%).
