To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = Probability of correctly identifying the height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% correct)
P(B|not A) = Probability of incorrectly identifying the height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (20% error)
P(not A) = P(shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3448.
