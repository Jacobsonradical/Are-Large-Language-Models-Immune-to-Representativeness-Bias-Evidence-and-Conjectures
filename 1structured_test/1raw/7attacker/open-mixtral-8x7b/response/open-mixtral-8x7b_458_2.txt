To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness errs and says the person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 41.38%.
