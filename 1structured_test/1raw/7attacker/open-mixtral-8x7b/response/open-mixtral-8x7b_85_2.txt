To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). 

- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- The witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|not A) = 0.2

Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
