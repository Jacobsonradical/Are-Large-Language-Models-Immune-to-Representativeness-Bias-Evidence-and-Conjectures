To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 0.85.

Now, we want to find P(A) given the witness's observation (W): P(A|W). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We can calculate P(W) as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Substituting the values we know, we get:
P(W) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now, let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation (W), as x:
x = P(A|W)

We can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:
x = (0.8 * x) / ((0.8 * x) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Solving for x:
x * 0.48 = 0.17
x = 0.17 / 0.48
x = 0.35417 (approximately)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.35417}
