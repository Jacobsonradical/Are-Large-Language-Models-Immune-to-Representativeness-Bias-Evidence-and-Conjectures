To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define the following terms:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* D: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To use Bayes' theorem, we need to find the following probabilities:

* P(H): the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% in the problem statement.
* P(D|H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, this probability is 0.8.
* P(D|¬H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is the probability of the witness making a mistake when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, this probability is 0.2.
* P(¬H): the prior probability that the attacker's height was not 185 cm or taller. This is given as 85% in the problem statement.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|D):

P(H|D) = P(D|H) \* P(H) / (P(D|H) \* P(H) + P(D|¬H) \* P(¬H))

Substituting the values we found above, we get:

P(H|D) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(H|D) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36, or 36%.
