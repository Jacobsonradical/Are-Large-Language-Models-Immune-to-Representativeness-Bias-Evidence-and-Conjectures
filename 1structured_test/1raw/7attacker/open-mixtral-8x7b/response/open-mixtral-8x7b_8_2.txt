To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event of being identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find P(B|A), which is the probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller if the person actually is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller if the person is not actually 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm). The witness makes an error in 20% of the cases when determining whether someone is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

We are also given the base rates: P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
