To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the question, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time, and 80% of those who are not 185 cm are shorter than 185 cm)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.16 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.5556

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.5556 or 55.56%.
