To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the witness would say the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than that. The witness erred in 20% of the cases, so if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the witness would still say they were 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

To calculate P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both the true positive rate (when the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the false positive rate (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm). We have already calculated the false positive rate to be 0.2. Therefore, the probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) x P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the population is split evenly between those who are 185 cm or taller and those who are shorter than 185 cm, we have P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 and P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Putting it all together:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 x 0.15) / ((0.8 x 0.15) + (0.2 x 0.5)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.10) = 0.12 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.545}.
