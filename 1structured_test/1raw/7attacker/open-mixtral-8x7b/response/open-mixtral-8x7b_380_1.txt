To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.15 according to the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is not 185 cm or taller is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, which is 0.2 according to the given information.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(A), P(B|A), and P(B|not A). We need to find P(not A), which is the probability that a random person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 according to the given information.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 0.414)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
