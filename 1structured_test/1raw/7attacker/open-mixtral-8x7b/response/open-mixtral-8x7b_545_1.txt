To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the observed evidence, which is the witness's statement.

From part (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.8, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2.

From part (b), we know that the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability of being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

First, we need to find P(E|H), the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.8, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(H), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15.

To find P(E), we need to consider two cases: the witness's statement is either true or false. If the statement is true, then the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the statement is P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) = (0.8) \* (0.15) = 0.12. If the statement is false, then the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and the probability of the statement is P(E) = P(E|not H) \* P(not H) = (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.17.

Therefore, the total probability of the statement is P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) = 0.345.

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
