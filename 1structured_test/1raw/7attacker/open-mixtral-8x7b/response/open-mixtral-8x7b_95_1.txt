To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the observed evidence, which includes the witness's statement and the known population statistics.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

First, let's compute P(B|A) - the probability of the observed evidence if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This probability can be calculated as the witness's correct identification rate, which is 80%.

Next, we need to compute P(B|not A), the probability of the observed evidence if the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
1. The probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the witness's error rate, 20%, times the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm, 85%, resulting in 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
2. The probability of the witness stating the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller, which is the complement of the witness's correct identification rate, 100% - 80% = 20%, times the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, 15%, resulting in 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Thus, P(B|not A) = 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.2.

Now we need to compute P(A) and P(not A) using the known population statistics:
- P(A) = Proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller = 15%.
- P(not A) = Proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm = 85%.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
