To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's state our prior belief about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population. This is given as 15% by point a. So, our prior probability P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's consider the new evidence, which is that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments under conditions similar to that night (point b). Therefore, the likelihood of this evidence given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). We denote this as P(E|A) = 0.8.

However, there's also a chance that the witness could be wrong, which happens 20% of the time according to point b. If the attacker was not 185 cm or taller, they would have been misidentified by the witness as such with a probability of 0.2. This is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(E|not A) = 0.2.

Finally, we need the overall likelihood of the evidence, which is the sum of the product of the prior probabilities and the corresponding likelihoods for each case. This is given by:

P(E) = P(E and A) + P(E and not A)
= P(A) * P(E|A) + P(not A) * P(E|not A)

Here, P(not A) is simply 1 - P(A), which equals 0.85 since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Substituting these values in, we get:

P(E) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, i.e., the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the new evidence, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
