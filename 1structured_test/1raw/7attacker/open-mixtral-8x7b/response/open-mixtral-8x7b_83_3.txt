To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given that event B has occurred.

First, we need to find P(A), the probability of event A. From the given information (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.15
