To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller

We are given P(E) = 0.15 and the witness's statistics: P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B'|A) = 0.2, P(B|A') = 0.2, P(B'|A') = 0.8, where A' denotes the complementary event of A.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now we can find the probability:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Solving for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2)

We are not provided with any specific information about the attacker that would affect P(A), so assuming no prior knowledge, we can take P(A) as a probability between 0 and 1. Let's denote it as x.

Since we want to find the maximum likelihood estimate for P(A), we can calculate P(A|B) for all possible x values between 0 and 1.

When x = 0, P(A|B) = 0.
When x = 1, P(A|B) = 0.8.

As x increases from 0 to 1, P(A|B) increases linearly, meaning the maximum likelihood estimate for P(A) is x=1.

Therefore, our estimate is:
{probability: 1}
