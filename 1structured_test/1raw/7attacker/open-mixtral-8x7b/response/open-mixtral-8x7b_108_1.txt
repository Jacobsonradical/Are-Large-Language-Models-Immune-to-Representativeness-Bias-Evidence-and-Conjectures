To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
1. P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
2. P(A): We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.
3. To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - P(B|A'): The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
   - P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 ≈ 0.4535

However, this value represents the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such, not the initial observation that the victim could not see the attacker's height. Since the witness made a correct identification 80% of the time, we should adjust our estimate accordingly:

Final estimate:
probability: 0.4535 * 0.8 ≈ 0.3628, or 36.28% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
