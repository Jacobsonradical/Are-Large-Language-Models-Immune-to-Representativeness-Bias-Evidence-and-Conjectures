To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person
- P(W|A'): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 1
