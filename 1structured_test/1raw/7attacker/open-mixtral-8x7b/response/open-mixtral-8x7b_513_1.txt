To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(A|B) is equal to P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.3429 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3429}
