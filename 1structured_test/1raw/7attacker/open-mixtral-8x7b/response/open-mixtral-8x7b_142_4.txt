To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall | Witness = Tall) = P(Witness = Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness = Tall)

We are given:
P(Witness = Tall | Tall) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(Witness = Tall), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is tall or the attacker is short. We are given:
P(Witness = Tall | Tall) = 0.8
P(Witness = Tall | Short) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
P(Short) = 1 - P(Tall) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(Witness = Tall) = P(Witness = Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness = Tall | Short) * P(Short)
P(Witness = Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall | Witness = Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
