To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(E) = 0.15. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Let's denote k = 0.8 / (0.8*P(A) + 0.2*(1-P(A))).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = k * 0.8 * P(A)

Since we want P(A), we need to solve for it.

From the information given, P(E) = P(A) since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and the attacker turned out to be 185 cm or taller. Thus, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can find k:
k = 0.8 / (0.8*0.15 + 0.2*(1-0.15)) ≈ 1.5714

Finally, we can calculate the probability:
P(A|B) = 1.5714 * 0.8 * 0.15 ≈ 0.1886

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1886 or 18.86%.
