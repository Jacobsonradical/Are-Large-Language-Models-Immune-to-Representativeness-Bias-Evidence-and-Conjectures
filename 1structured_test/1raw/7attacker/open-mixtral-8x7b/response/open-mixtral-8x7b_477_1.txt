To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A), and we can use Bayes' theorem to do this.

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing the witness's statement (the height judgment) given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Let's denote this likelihood as P(W|A), which is the probability of the witness's statement (W) given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A).

P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height) + 0.2 * 0.15 (witness errs and the true height is 15%, which is the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate the likelihood of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Let's denote this likelihood as P(W|¬A), which is the probability of the witness's statement (W) given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (¬A).

P(W|¬A) = 0.8 * 0.85 (witness correctly identifies the height) + 0.2 (witness errs)

Now, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is denoted as P(A). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

We know P(A), and we calculated P(W|A) and P(W|¬A) above. We need to calculate P(¬A), which is the prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2))

After calculating, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.21) = 0.15 / 0.36 ≈ 0.4167

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4167 (or 41.67%).
