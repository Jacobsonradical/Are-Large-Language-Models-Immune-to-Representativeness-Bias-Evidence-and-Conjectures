To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller

We are given P(E) = 0.15, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8, and the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
