To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the prior probability from the city's population.

1. Prior probability (P(A)) - Based on the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller: P(A) = 0.15
2. Witness accuracy (P(B|A)) - The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: P(B|A) = 0.8
3. Witness error (P(B|not A)) - The witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and we assume a uniform distribution, P(not A) = 0.85. Now, we calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
