To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's break down the two scenarios for the witness:
1. The suspect is actually 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time and erroneously say they are 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
2. The suspect is actually shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is an 85% chance that the suspect is in scenario 2, and a 15% chance that the suspect is in scenario 1.

We want to find the probability that the suspect is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the suspect as such (scenario 1). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability:

P(185 cm | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), P(185 cm) = 0.15, and we need to find P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller).

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

We know P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm) = 0.8, P(185 cm) = 0.15, and P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85. We need to find P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Shorter than 185 cm) for the second term. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.345}
