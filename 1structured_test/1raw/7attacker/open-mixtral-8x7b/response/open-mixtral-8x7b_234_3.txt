To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2/0.85 ≈ 0.2353 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2353 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2824

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2824, or 28.24%.
