To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(B) = 0.15

Since the attacker was identified as 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually that tall, we can write the following:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We want to find P(A), so let's first calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

Using the given data, we know that P(B) = 0.15, so P(¬B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, and we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = P(¬B) = 0.85.

Now, let's calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can go back to our equation for P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.29 = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Solving for P(A):

P(A) = P(A|W) * (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 ≈ 0.1517

However, this answer is slightly counter-intuitive because we initially expected P(A) = P(B) = 0.15. The reason for this discrepancy is that the witness is more likely to identify a person as 185 cm or taller, even if the person is actually shorter. This leads to a higher probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
