To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- ~W as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

However, we don't have enough information about P(~W|E), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We cannot calculate P(E) directly using the witness's information alone.

Instead, we can use the population distribution to estimate P(E):
P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%}
