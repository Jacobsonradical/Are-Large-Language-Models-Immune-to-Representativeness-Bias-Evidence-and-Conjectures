To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.5 (witness randomly guessed the height when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which has a 50% chance of being correct)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]
      = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.425)
      = 0.12 / 0.545
      = 0.22

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.22}
