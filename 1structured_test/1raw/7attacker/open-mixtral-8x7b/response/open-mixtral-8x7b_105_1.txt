To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that this assessment is correct.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to calculate.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 100% or 1.
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (1 \* 0.15) / ((1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.46875}.
