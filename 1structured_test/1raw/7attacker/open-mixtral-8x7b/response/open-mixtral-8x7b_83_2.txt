To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to the joint and marginal probabilities of those events.

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
