To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A being true given the evidence B. This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of observing the evidence B if the hypothesis A is true.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis A being true, before considering the evidence.
- P(B) is the total probability of observing the evidence B.

In our case, let A be the event that "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller", and B be the event that "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.17*0.85 = 0.203

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.203 â‰ˆ 0.59

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.59.
