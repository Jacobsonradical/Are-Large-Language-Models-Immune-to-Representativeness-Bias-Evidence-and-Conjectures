To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the reliability of the witness. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and P(B) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, and thus identifies them as such)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
