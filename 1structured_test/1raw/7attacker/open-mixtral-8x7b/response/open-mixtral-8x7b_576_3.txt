To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time in such cases).
- P(not A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

We want to find:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B). We can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(B|not A), so we can use them to find P(B and A) and P(B and not A):

P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can find P(B):
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
