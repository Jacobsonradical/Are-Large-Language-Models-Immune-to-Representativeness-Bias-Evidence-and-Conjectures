To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. They correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and they erroneously say a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness would have identified them correctly, and if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, there is a 20% chance that the witness would have mistakenly identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that if we select a person at random from the population, there is an 85% chance that they will be shorter than 185 cm and a 15% chance that they will be 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We are also given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
