To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote by H as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not actually that tall)

Now, we want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

First, calculate P(¬H), the probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller:

P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(E|¬H) * P(¬H):

P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H):

P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.235

Finally, calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)] = 0.12 / 0.235 ≈ 0.511

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.511 or 51.1%.
