To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge height and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm)

From the given information, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 0.85.

To find P(A), we need to use Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(W ∩ A) / P(W)

First, we need to find P(W):
P(W) = P(W ∩ A) + P(W ∩ A')

Now, we can express P(W ∩ A) as:
P(W ∩ A) = P(W|A) * P(A)

Similarly, we can express P(W ∩ A') as:
P(W ∩ A') = P(W|A') * P(A')

Now, we can find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Substitute the values we know:
P(W) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can find P(A):
P(A) = P(W ∩ A) / P(W)
P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

Solve for P(A):
P(A) = 0.686 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.686 or 68.6%.
