To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is what we want to find.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given these probabilities as 0.15 and 0.85 respectively. Given these, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
0.8 = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.29
0.8 * P(A) = 0.29
P(A) = 0.29 / 0.8
P(A) = 0.3625

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3625.
