To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the question, we are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17]
â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3158.
