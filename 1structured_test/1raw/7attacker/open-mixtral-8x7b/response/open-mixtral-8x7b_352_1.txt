To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population percentage.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We can apply Bayes' theorem here:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

2. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%, or 0.15.

3. P(B): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
- The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness identified the attacker correctly: P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness identified the attacker incorrectly as 185 cm or taller: P(!A) * P(B|!A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
