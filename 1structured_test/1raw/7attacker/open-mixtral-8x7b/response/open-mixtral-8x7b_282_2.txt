To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from statement a)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (from statement b)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from statement b)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (from statement a)

Now we can calculate:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33
- P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.33 ≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
