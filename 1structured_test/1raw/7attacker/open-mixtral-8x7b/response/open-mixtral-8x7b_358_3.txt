To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the city's population)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate it as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
