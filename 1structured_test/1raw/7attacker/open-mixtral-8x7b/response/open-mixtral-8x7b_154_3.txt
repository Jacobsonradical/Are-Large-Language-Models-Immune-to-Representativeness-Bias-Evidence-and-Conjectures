To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
