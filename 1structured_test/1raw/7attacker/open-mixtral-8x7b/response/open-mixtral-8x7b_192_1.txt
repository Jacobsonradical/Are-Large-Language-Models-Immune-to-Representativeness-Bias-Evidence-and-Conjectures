To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller

We know from the given information that:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

However, we don't have P(A) or P(¬A). But we can use the fact that P(A) + P(¬A) = 1. Let's rewrite P(¬A) as 1 - P(A). Now our equation becomes:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(A)) * P(W|¬A)]

We know the values for all the terms in this equation except for P(A). To find P(A), let's consider a reasonable range for it. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller than the average height in the population. Thus, P(A) > P(B) = 0.15.

Let's try different values of P(A) in the range (0.15, 1) and compute P(A|W). We will see that as P(A) increases, the value of P(A|W) also increases. By trying different values, we can estimate that:

When P(A) = 0.8, P(A|W) ≈ 0.73.

Given that the attacker's height is likely higher than the average height, it seems reasonable to assume that P(A) is closer to 0.8 than to 0.15. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
