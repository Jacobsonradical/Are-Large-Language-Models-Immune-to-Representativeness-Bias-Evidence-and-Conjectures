To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given the following information:
- The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (prior probability).
- The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- The population in the city has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
We are given P(A) = 0.15 (population distribution)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

To find P(B|not A), we consider the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4535}
