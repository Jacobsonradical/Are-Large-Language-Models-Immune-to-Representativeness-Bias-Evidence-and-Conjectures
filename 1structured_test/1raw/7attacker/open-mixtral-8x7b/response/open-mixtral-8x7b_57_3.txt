To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B - event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases where the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 (37.5%).
