To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the information provided (event B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of identifying a person correctly as 185 cm or taller when they are (0.8*0.15), and the probability of identifying a person incorrectly as 185 cm or taller when they are not (0.2*0.85). So, P(B) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.21.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8*0.15) / 0.21] â‰ˆ 0.5714

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%.
