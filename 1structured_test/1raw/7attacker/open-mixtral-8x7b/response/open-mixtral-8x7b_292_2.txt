To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability that a person randomly selected from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to clue (b).
P(B) is the probability of correctly identifying a person's height by the witness, which is 0.8 according to clue (a).
P(~B) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a person's height by the witness, which is 1 - P(B) = 0.2.

What we want to find is P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We already know P(A), P(B|A) and P(~B) = P(B|~A). We just need to calculate P(~A), the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.09 / 0.26
P(A|B) = 0.346153846154

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3462.
