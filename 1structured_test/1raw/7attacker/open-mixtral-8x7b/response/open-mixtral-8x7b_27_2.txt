To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the baseline probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which we get from statement (a):

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

Next, we need to account for the witness's reliability in identifying the attacker's height, as given in statement (b). The witness is correct 80% of the time, which means their sensitivity is 0.8. However, we also need to consider the false positive rate, which is 20%, or a specificity of 0.8.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, which translates to the following:

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness Identification)

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) * P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm)] / P(Witness Identification)

We've already computed P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.15. Now we need to calculate the other probabilities in Bayes' theorem.

P(Witness Identification | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = Sensitivity = 0.8

To calculate P(Witness Identification), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Taller than or equal to 185 cm) * P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

We know P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.15, so we need to find P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.85.

The probability P(Witness Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) is the false positive rate, which is 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can compute P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness Identification) using Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
