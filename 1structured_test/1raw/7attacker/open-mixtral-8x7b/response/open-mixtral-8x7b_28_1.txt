To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we can compute the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, which we can compute as the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios:
  - The attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies the height: P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
  - The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness erroneously identifies the height as 185 cm or taller: P(!A) * P(B|!A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
  So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is {probability: 0.345}.
