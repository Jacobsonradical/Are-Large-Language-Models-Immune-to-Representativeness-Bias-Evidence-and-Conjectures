To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: Given that someone is 185 cm or taller, they are identified as such 80% of the time by the witness.
- Event C: The population distribution where 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from a)
P(A) = 0.15 (from b, as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by summing the product of P(B|A), P(A) for all possible heights (A). Since we don't know the exact distribution for heights, we'll approximate it using the given data:

P(B) = P(B|A=185cm) * P(A=185cm) + P(B|A=other heights) * P(A=other heights)
P(B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
