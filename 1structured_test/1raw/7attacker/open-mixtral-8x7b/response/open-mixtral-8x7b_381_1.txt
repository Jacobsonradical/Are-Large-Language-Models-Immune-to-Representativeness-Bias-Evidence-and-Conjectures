To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
- Pr(A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- Pr(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller,
- Pr(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller,
- Pr(¬A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
Pr(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
Pr(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
Pr(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
Pr(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability Pr(A|B):

Pr(A|B) = Pr(B|A) * Pr(A) / (Pr(B|A) * Pr(A) + Pr(B|¬A) * Pr(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
