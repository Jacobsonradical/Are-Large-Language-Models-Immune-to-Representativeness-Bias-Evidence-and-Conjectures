To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability we want to find) is equal to the product of the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:
- Prior probability (P(H)): Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15
- Likelihood (P(E|H)): The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8
- Probability of the evidence (P(E)): We can find this using the law of total probability:
  P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  where not H is the complementary event of H, so P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
  and P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
  So, P(E) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E:
- Posterior probability (P(H|E)): P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.32) = 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.375.
