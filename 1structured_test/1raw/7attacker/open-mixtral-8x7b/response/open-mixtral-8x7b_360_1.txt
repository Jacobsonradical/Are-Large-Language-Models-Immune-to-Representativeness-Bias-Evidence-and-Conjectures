To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness mistakenly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85 = 0.1385 + 0.0255 = 0.164

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.164 â‰ˆ 0.7301

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.7301}
