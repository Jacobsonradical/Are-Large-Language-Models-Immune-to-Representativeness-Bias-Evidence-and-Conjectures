To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Since the attacker was attacked from behind, the victim could not see the attacker's height, so the only relevant information is the witness's statement and ability to judge height.

From the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- The witness erred (identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they were not) 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use this information as a likelihood and combine it with the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city.

Prior probability:
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Likelihood of the witness's statement:
- The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Posterior probability = Prior probability x Likelihood

Posterior probability = 0.15 (1 - 0.20) + 0.85 (0.20)
= 0.15 x 0.80 + 0.85 x 0.20
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.29}.
