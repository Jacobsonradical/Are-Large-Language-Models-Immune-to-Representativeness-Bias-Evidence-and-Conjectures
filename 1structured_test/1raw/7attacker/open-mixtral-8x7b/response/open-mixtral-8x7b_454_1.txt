To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(Correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(Error) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(Correct) = 0.8
P(Error) = 0.2
P(Short) = 0.85 (15% or more are 185 cm or taller)
P(Tall) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:
P(Tall | B) = P(B | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(B)

We know P(B | Tall) = P(Correct) = 0.8, P(Tall) = 0.15, and we need to find P(B).

P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(B | Short) * P(Short)

Since P(B | Short) = P(Error) = 0.2, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(Tall | B):

P(Tall | B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
