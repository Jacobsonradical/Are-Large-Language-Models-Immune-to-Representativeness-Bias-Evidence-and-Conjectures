To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing new evidence.

Let's define:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the given information.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on the given information.

We want to calculate: P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we compute P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then, we compute P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to get P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17] = 0.3077 or ~31%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.3077}.
