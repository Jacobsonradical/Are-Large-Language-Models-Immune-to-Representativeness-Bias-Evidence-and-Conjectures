To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and B (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, my estimate is that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
