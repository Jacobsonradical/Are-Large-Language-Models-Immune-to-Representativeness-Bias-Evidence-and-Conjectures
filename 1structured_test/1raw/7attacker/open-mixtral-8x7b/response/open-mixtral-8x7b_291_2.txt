To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the chance that the witness correctly identifies the height when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by summing the probabilities of the event given both height categories:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

The probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2 (given by the problem). The prior probability of a randomly chosen person not being 185 cm or taller is 0.85.

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.34.
