To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
- P(Â¬B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they actually are 185 cm or taller.
- P(SH) as the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 1
