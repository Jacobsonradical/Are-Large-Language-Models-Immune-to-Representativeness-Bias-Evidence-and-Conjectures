To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% or 0.15
P(B|A): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such = 80% or 0.8
P(B|not A): Probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This is given by the total probability, which is a weighted sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), weighted by P(not A) and P(A) respectively:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
