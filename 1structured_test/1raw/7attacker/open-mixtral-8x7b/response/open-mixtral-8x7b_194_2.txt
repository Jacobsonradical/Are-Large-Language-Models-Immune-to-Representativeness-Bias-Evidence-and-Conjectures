To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (witness erred in 20% of the cases and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.68 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.1579

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1579 or 15.79%.
