To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's find P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now, substitute the given values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can finally calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.38 or 38%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.38 or 38%.
