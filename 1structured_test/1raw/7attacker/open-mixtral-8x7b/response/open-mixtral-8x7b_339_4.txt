To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the available information.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From part (a), we have the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies 20% of people who are shorter than 185 cm)

From part (b), we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
≈ 0.36

So our estimate is:
{probability: 0.36}
