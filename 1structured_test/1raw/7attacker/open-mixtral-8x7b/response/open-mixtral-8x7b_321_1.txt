To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the witness's accuracy in judging height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%, or 0.8.
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). This is given as 20%, or 0.2.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%, or 0.15 for the city's population.
- P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 85%, or 0.85 for the city's population.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.36.
