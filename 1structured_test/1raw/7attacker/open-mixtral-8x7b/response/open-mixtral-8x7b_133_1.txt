To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(A) = 15% (or 0.15) since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) = 80% (or 0.8) because the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|¬A) = 20% (or 0.2) because the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm
- P(¬A) = 85% (or 0.85) since 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm

To find P(A|B), we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.3846

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 38.46%.
