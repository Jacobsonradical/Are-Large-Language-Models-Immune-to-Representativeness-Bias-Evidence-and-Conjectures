To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(A') = 0.85
- P(A) = 0.15

We want to estimate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as such.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

Now, we need to calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

However, this is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as such and taking into account the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Given that the witness has a relatively high success rate, we can be more confident in the estimate. But, since we do not know the exact conditions of the observation, it's impossible to give an exact probability.

So, in the format you requested: {probability: 0.345, explanation: "This estimate takes into account the witness's ability to judge a person's height, but it's still an approximation due to the lack of specifics about the observation conditions."}
