To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A): probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness erred 20% of the time when the person is NOT 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.7647

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7647 (or 76.47%).
