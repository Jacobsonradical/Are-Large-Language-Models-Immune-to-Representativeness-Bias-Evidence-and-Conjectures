To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, i.e., the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (event B). We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. However, we don't have information about the witness's accuracy when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we cannot calculate the conditional probability P(B|A) directly.

To overcome this, let's assume that the witness never makes the mistake of identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (which is the more conservative assumption). This way, we can calculate the lower bound of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Under this assumption, P(B|A) = 1, since the witness always identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by considering the two possible cases: the person is 185 cm or taller, or the person is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We don't know P(B|not A) directly, but we can use the witness's overall error rate, which is 20%. Since the witness never overestimates a person's height, this error rate must come from underestimating the height of taller people. Therefore, we can assume that P(B|not A) = 20%, since the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller only when they are actually taller.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
     = 1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
     = 0.15 + 0.17
     = 0.32

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
       = 1 \* 0.15 / 0.32
       = 0.46875

Since the witness never makes the mistake of identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 46.875%.

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
