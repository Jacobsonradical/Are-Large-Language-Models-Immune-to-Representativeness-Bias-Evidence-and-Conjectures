To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.4667

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4667}
