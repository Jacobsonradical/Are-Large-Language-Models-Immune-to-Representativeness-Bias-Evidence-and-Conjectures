To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A), the prior probability of A: 15% or 0.15
- P(B|A), the probability of B given A: 80% or 0.8 (the witness accurately identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A), the probability of B given ¬A: 20% or 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability of ¬A: 100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85

Next, calculate P(B), the probability of B:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.345.
