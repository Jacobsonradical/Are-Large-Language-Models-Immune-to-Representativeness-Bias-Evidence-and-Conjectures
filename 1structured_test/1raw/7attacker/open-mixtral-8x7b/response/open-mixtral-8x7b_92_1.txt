To reason through this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from a).
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from b).
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (from b).
- P(not A) is the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the new evidence, is approximately 0.41.
