To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information, one about the witness's ability to judge a person's height, and the other about the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B|A) as the probability of correctly identifying a person's height by the witness when the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(¬B|A) as the probability of incorrectly identifying a person's height by the witness when the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
- P(B|¬A) as the probability of correctly identifying a person's height by the witness when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (100% - 15%).
- P(¬B|¬A) as the probability of incorrectly identifying a person's height by the witness when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 15%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of A based on Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.7225) = 0.096 / 0.8185 ≈ 0.1173

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is around 0.1173 or 11.73%.
