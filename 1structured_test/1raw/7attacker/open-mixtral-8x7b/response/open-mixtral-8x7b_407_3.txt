To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker's height correctly 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller and erred 20% of the time.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we know P(B|A) from the witness's ability to judge a person's height: P(B|A) = 0.8

Second, we know P(A) from the city's population data: P(A) = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identified the height (P(B|A)) or the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm and the witness erred in identifying the height (P(B|A')).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we don't have P(B|A'). To find it, we need to use the complementary probability:

P(B'|A') = 1 - P(B|A')

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, they are incorrect 20% of the time. And, given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness is more likely to err in this direction.

Let E be the event of the witness erring:

P(E) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, we can find P(B|A') = 1 - P(E) = 0.83

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.83 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.7055 = 0.8255

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8255
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.1452

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1452 or 14.52%.
