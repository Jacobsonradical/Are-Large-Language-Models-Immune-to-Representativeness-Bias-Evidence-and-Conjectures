To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. From the given information, we have:

P(A) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person = 80% = 0.8
P(!A) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85
P(B|!A) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter = 20% = 0.2

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)]

First, compute P(B|A) * P(A):

P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

Next, compute P(B|!A) * P(!A):

P(B|!A) * P(!A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now, sum the two results:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
