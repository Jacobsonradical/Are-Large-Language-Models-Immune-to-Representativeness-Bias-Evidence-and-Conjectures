To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller - from b)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.5 (the witness randomly guesses the height as 185 cm or taller 50% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller - since half the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to find P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.5)(1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.425
= 0.545

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.545
â‰ˆ 0.2165

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2165.
