To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information (b).

P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information (a).

P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 according to information (a).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B):

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
