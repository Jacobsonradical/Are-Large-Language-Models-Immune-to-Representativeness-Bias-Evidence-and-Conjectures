To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

According to the information provided, we know that:
- P(A) = 15% (from statement a)
- P(B|A) = 80% (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, from statement b)
- P(B|¬A) = 20% (the witness erroneously identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, from statement b)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 15% = 85%

Now, let's calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 20% * 85% = 17%

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = [80% * 15%] / [(80% * 15%) + 17%] = 12% / (12% + 17%) = 12% / 29% ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
