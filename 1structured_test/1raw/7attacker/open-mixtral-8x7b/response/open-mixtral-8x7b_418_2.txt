To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 (since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, but because of the witness's error, this represents a 20% chance for the witness to mistakenly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm) = P(witness identifies 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm) * P(attacker is 185 cm) + P(witness identifies 185 cm | attacker is not 185 cm) * P(attacker is not 185 cm)

P(185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.
