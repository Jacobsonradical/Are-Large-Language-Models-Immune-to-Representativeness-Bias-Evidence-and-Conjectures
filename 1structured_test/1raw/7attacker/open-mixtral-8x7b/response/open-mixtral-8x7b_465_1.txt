To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A): 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A): 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate P(B). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|not A), it's the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2. And P(not A) is 85% or 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
