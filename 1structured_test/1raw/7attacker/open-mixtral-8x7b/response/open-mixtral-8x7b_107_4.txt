To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the city's population. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)

We are given P(witness | 185 cm) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(185 cm) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city's population)

To calculate P(witness), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This probability can be calculated as follows:

P(witness | shorter) = 0.2 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) + P(witness | shorter) \* P(shorter)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.38 / 0.29
= 1.31

Since this value is greater than 1, it suggests that there is not enough information to make a precise estimate of the probability. However, we can still say that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is higher than the prior probability of 0.15.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: > 0.15}
