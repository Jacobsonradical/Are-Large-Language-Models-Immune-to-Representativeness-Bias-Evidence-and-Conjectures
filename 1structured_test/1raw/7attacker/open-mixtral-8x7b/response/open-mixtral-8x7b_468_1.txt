To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W_T): probability that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W_F): probability that the witness identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm
- P(S): probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the city's population
- P(T): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population

From the given information, we know the following:
1. P(T) = 0.15
2. P(S) = 0.85
3. P(W_T | T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height in 80% of cases when the person is 185 cm or taller)
4. P(W_F | S) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(T), so let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(T) = P(T | W_T) * P(W_T) / [P(T | W_T) * P(W_T) + P(S | W_F) * P(W_F)]

To compute this, first, notice that P(W_T) = P(T) * P(W_T | T) + P(S) * P(W_T | S). However, we don't know P(W_T | S) and P(W_F | T), but they are equal due to symmetry:

P(W_T | S) = P(W_F | T) = 1 - P(W_F | S) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we can compute P(W_T):

P(W_T) = P(T) * P(W_T | T) + P(S) * P(W_T | S) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68

Similarly, we can compute P(W_F):

P(W_F) = P(S) * P(W_F | S) + P(T) * P(W_F | T) = 0.85 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.19

Now we can compute P(T) using Bayes' theorem:

P(T) = P(T | W_T) * P(W_T) / [P(T | W_T) * P(W_T) + P(S | W_F) * P(W_F)] = 0.8 * 0.68 / (0.8 * 0.68 + 0.19) â‰ˆ 0.81

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.81}
