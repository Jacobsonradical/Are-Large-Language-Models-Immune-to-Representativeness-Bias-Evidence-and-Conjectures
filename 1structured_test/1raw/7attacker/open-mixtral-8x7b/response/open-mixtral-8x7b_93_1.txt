To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller
P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller
P(W|A') as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is less than 185 cm

We have the following probabilities given in the problem:
P(A) = ?
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(B)]

However, we don't know P(A). But, we can reason that P(A) should be greater than or equal to P(B) because the witness saw the attacker and identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Thus, we consider two cases:

Case 1: P(A) = P(B) = 0.15
In this case,
P(A|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.15)] â‰ˆ 0.5714

Case 2: P(A) > P(B) = 0.15
In this case, P(A|W) would be even greater than 0.5714.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5714 or higher}
