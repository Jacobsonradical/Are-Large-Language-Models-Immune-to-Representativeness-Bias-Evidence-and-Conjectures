To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define our events:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W = Witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from "b")
P(W|A) = P(witness identifies correctly that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from "a")
P(W|¬A) = P(witness identifies incorrectly that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (from "a", since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is shorter than 1
