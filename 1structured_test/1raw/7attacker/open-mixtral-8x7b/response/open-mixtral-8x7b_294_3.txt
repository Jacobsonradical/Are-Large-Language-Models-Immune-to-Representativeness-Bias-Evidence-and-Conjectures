To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

First, calculate P(B|A') * P(A'):
P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545 or 45.45%.
