To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of this height based on the witness's testimony and the general population statistics.

First, let's determine the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's determine the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(Incorrectly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Correctly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, let's use these probabilities to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement "the attacker was 185 cm or taller":

P(185 cm or taller | Witness statement) = [P(Witness statement | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness statement)

We can simplify this expression by assuming that the witness statement is conditionally independent of the population statistics, given the attacker's height. This allows us to say that P(Witness statement) = P(Witness statement | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness statement | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(Witness statement | Shorter than 185 cm) as follows:

P(Witness statement | Shorter than 185 cm) = P(Incorrectly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(Witness statement):

P(Witness statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness statement) = [P(Witness statement | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness statement)

We already know the values for P(Witness statement) and P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(Witness statement | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8. So:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4535}
