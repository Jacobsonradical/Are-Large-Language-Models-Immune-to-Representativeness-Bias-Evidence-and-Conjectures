To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. According to the information, when the witness encounters someone who is 185 cm or taller, they correctly identify them as such 80% of the time, and they incorrectly identify them as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. According to the information, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification of them as such.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as such 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider the two ways that the witness could identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identifies them as being 185 cm or taller.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|not A) * 0.85

We are not given any information about the witness's ability to identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that, so we cannot directly calculate P(W|not A). However, we can use the fact that the witness's overall accuracy is 80% to put a bound on this quantity.

Since the witness is 80% accurate overall, this means that they incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that no more than 20% of the time. Therefore, P(W|not A) ≤ 0.2.

Using this bound, we can calculate a lower bound for P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
≥ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.36

Therefore, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 0.36.
