To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = ?
P(B) = 0.15
P(W|A) = 0.80
P(W|¬A) = 0.20

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

To find P(A), we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (¬A) and use the fact that the probabilities sum up to 1:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)
0.85 = 1 - P(A)
P(A) = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
