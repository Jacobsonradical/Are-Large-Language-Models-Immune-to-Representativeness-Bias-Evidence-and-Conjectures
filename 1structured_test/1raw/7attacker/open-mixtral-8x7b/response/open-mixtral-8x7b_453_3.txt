To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can write:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From the problem, we have:
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness makes errors 20% of the time, and when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
