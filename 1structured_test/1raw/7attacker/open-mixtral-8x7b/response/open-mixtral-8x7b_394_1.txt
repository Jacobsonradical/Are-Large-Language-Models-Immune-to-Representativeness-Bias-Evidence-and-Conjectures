To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
P(E) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city's population

From the information provided, we can calculate:
P(B|E) = Witness accuracy = 0.8 (80% correct when the actual height is 185 cm or taller)
P(!E) = 1 - P(E) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(E|!B) = 1 - P(B|E) = 0.2 (20% chance of witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:
P(B) = P(B|E) * P(E) + P(B|!E) * P(!E)
P(B) = (0.8 * P(E)) + (0.2 * 0.85)

To find P(E), we need to use the witness's accuracy again:
P(E) = P(B|E) - P(B|!E) * P(!E) / P(B)
P(E) = 0.8 - (0.2 * 0.85) / P(B)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * P(E)) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = (0.8 * (0.8 - (0.2 * 0.85) / P(B))) + (0.2 * 0.85)
0.208 * P(B) = 0.148
P(B) = 0.148 / 0.208
P(B) = 0.7115384615

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(E|B) = P(B|E) * P(E) / P(B)
P(E|B) = (0.8 * (0.8 - (0.2 * 0.85) / 0.7115384615)) / 0.7115384615
P(E|B) â‰ˆ 0.7715384615

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.7715384615}
