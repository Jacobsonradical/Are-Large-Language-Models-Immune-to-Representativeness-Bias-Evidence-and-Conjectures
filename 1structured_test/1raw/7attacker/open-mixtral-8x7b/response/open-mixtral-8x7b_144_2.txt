To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from statement b)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (from statement a)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (from statement a)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can substitute the given probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
