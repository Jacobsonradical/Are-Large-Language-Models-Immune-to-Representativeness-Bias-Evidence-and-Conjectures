To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Let's denote these probabilities as P(A) for the attacker being 185 cm or taller and P(B) for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's take into account the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (P(W|A)). Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (P(W|B)).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability we're interested in: P(A|W) or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)].

By substituting the values we have, we get:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 or 41.4%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.414 (41.4%).
