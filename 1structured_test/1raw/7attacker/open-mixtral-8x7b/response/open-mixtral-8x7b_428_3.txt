To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the available information.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

From statement "b", we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.188 + 0.1445
= 0.3325

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3325
= 0.12 * (1/0.3325)
= 0.12 / 0.3325
= 0.3607 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.3607}
