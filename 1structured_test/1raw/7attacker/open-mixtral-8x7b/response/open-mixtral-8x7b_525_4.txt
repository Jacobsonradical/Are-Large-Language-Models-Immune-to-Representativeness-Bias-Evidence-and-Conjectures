To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- W_T: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- W_S: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
P(T) = ?
P(S) = 0.85
P(W_T | T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(W_S | S) = 0.8 (witness incorrectly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm)

From the total probability theorem, we have:
P(W_T) = P(W_T | T) * P(T) + P(W_T | S) * P(S)

Our goal is to find P(T).

We are given that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the witness incorrectly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.

We can write:
P(W_T) = 0.8 * P(T) + 0.2 * 0.15

Now, we need to find P(W_T), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller. The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller in 80% of the cases when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, so:

P(W_T) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * P(W_T)

Solving for P(W_T), we get:
P(W_T) = 0.12

Now, we can find P(T) using the total probability theorem equation:
0.12 = 0.8 * P(T) + 0.2 * 0.15

Solving for P(T), we get:
P(T) = (0.12 - 0.03) / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.1125

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1125}
