To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- P(A): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (when the true height is 185 cm or taller) or 0.2 (when the true height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A|B): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such

We want to find P(A|B), which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
         = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
           = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
