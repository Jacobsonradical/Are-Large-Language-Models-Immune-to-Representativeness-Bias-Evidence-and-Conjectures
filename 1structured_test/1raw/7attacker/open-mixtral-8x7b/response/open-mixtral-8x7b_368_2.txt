To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

a) A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. This means the witness correctly identified tall people 80% of the time and incorrectly identified shorter people as tall 20% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter.

Let's define:
- A as "The attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to find the probabilities:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we need to account for both true positives (correctly identifying tall attackers) and false positives (identifying short attackers as tall):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.120 + 0.170
= 0.290

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.290
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
