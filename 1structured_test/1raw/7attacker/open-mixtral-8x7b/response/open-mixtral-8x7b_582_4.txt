To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new information.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to find P(not A), which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, then P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we need to find P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the new information, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
