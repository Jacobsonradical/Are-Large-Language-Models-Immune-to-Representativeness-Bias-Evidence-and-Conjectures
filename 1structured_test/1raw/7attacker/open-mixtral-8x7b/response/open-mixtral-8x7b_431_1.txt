To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|Â¬A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
