To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when they are not, and apply the witness's accuracy:
- P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
