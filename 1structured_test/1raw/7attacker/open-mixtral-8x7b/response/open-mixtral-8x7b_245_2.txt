To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the base rate, which is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city. According to statement (a), 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting an attacker who is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, we need to take into account the accuracy of the witness. According to statement (b), the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is p, then the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8p, and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.2p.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)

P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) + P(witness | <185 cm) \* P(<185 cm)

P(witness | <185 cm) = 1 - P(witness | 185 cm) = 0.2

P(witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.37
= 0.324324324324

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.32.

Answer: {probability: 0.32}
