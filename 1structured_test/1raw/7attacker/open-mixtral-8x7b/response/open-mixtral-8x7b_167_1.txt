To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller

We know from the given information:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))

We want to estimate P(A), so we need to rearrange the formula:
P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) * P(A') / (P(W|A) * P(A) * P(A') + P(W|A') * P(A')^2)

Now we can use the values given:
P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) * 0.15 / (0.8 * P(A) * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85^2)

To solve for P(A), we need to find a value that satisfies the above equation. By trying different values, we find that P(A) = 0.343 gives us a consistent solution:

0.8 * 0.343 * 0.15 = 0.03432 ≈ 0.034 (P(W|A) * P(A) * P(A'))
0.8 * 0.343 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85^2 = 0.06968 + 0.1444 ≈ 0.214 (P(W|A) * P(A) * P(A') + P(W|A') * P(A')^2)

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
