To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353 (the witness erred and identified the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is shorter than 185 cm, with an error rate of 20%, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the probability of interest:
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
        ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2353 * 0.85)
        ≈ 0.1519

Based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 15.19%.
