To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

Our prior probability (before considering the witness's testimony) is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which according to the given information is 15%. So, P(A) = 0.15 where A represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

The witness's testimony provides additional information. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. So, P(B|A) = 0.8. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller. This means that if the person is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness will still say they are 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
