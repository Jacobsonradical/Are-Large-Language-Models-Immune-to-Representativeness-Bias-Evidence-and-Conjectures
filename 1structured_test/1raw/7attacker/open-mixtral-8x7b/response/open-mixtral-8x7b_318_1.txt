To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller:
P(Correct Identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:
P(Incorrect Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. To do this, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(Witness Identification)

We know the following probabilities:
P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the city's population)

To calculate P(Witness Identification), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller or the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we know that:
P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we need to find the conditional probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the probability of an incorrect identification:

P(Witness Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) = P(Incorrect Identification | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Based on this calculation, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
