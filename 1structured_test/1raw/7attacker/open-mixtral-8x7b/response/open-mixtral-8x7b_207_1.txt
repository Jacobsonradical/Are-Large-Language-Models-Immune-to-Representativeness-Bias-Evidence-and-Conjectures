To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population. Then, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update our initial belief based on the new evidence.

First, calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller:
P(Correct_ID | ≥185 cm) = 0.8

Next, calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:
P(Incorrect_ID | <185 cm) = 0.2

Now, calculate the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population:
P(≥185 cm) = 0.15

And the base rate for people who are shorter than 185 cm:
P(<185 cm) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(≥185 cm | Correct_ID) = P(Correct_ID | ≥185 cm) * P(≥185 cm) / (P(Correct_ID | ≥185 cm) * P(≥185 cm) + P(Incorrect_ID | <185 cm) * P(<185 cm))
                                     = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
                                     ≈ 0.3846

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3846 or 38.46%.
