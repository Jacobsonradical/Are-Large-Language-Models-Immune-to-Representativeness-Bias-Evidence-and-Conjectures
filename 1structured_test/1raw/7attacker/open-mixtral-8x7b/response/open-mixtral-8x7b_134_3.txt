To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We first need to determine the prior probability, likelihood, and normalizing constant.

Prior probability (P(A)) = Probability that an individual is 185 cm or taller in the city's population: 0.15

Likelihood (P(B|A)) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller: 0.8

Normalizing constant (P(B)) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability (P(A|B)) = Likelihood * Prior probability / Normalizing constant
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
