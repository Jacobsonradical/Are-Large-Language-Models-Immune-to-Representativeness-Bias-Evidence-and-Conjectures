To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(W):
P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.8)*(0.15) = 0.12
P(W|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.17
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.12) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
