To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, which is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given:
1. P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to find the total probability of the evidence E for both cases when A is true and when A is false.

P(E) = P(E and A) + P(E and not A)
= P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

However, since we're asked for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and not the conditional probability, we should use the original fraction:

{probability: 0.15}
