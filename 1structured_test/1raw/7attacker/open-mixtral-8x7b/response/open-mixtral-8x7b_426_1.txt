To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the given information, we have:

1. P(A), the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller: 0.15 (15% of the population)
2. P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they indeed are: 0.8 (80% chance)
3. P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% chance of error, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
≈ 0.4535

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4535}
