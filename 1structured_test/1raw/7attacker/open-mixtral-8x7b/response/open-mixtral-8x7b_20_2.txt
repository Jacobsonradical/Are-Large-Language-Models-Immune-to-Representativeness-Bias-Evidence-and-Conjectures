To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

We have the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): probability of observing the witness's report given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the witness's report

From part (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2.

From part (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, let's find P(B), the probability of the witness's report. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We can find P(B and A) by multiplying P(B|A) and P(A):

P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

To find P(B and not A), first calculate P(not B):

P(not B) = P(not B and A) + P(not B and not A)

We already know P(not B and A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, so:

P(not B and not A) = P(not B) - P(not B and A) = 0.85 - 0.03 = 0.82

Now, we can find P(B and not A):

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We don't know P(B|not A), but we can express it as:

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
