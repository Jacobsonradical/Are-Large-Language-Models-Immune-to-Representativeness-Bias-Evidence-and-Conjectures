To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time), and P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred and said the person was 185 cm or taller when they were not 20% of the time).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

Substituting the values from the problem, we get:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging this back into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
