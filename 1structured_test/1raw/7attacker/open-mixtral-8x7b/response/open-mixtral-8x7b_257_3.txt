To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(H|E) = [ P(E|H) * P(H) ] / [ P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H) ]
= [ 0.8 * 0.15 ] / [ 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85 ]
≈ 0.7619

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7619 or 76.19%.
