To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from part b)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.80 (from part a, the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.20 (from part a, the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 85% = 0.85 (from part b, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we need to find P(not A|B). This is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the formula for total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.120 + 0.170 = 0.290

Now we can find P(not A|B):

P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) / P(B)
= 0.20 * 0.85 / 0.290
= 0.1724 / 0.290
= 0.5945 (rounded to four decimal places)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 1 - P(not A|B)
= 1 - 0.5945
= 0.4055

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4055 or 40.55%.
