To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
P(E) = Probability of the witness making the stated observation, regardless of the attacker's height

From the problem description:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will identify them as such)
P(B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness will correctly identify 80% of people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(E), the probability of the witness making the stated observation, which is a combination of correct and incorrect identifications:
P(E) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = (1 \* 0.15) + (0.8 \* 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.68 = 0.83

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|E) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(E) = (1 \* 0.15) / 0.83 ≈ 0.1807

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.1807}
