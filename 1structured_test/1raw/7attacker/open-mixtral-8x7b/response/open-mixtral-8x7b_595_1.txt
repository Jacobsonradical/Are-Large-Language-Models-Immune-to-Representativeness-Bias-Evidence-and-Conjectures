To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

We have the following information:

P(A) = 15% (from point a)
P(B|A) = 80% (from point b, the probability of the witness being correct)
P(B|not A) = 20% (from point b, the probability of the witness making an error)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

First, we need to find P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 85%

Now, we can calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 20% * 85% = 17%

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)) = 80% * 15% / (80% * 15% + 17%) = 0.314 or 31.4%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 31.4%.
