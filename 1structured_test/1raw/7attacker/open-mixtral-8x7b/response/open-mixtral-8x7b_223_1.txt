To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W = The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find: P(A|W)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(W|¬A):
P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Next, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
