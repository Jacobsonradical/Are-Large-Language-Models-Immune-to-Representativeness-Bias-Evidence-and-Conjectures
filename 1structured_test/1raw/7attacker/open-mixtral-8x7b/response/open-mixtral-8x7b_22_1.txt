Let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the witness's statement.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

Now we need to find P(B), which is the total probability of the witness's statement. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness's statement given the attacker's height, weighted by the probability of the attacker's height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT actually 185 cm or taller. This is the inverse of the witness's accuracy, or 0.2 (20%).

P(not A) is the probability of the attacker NOT being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85%).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find the probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
