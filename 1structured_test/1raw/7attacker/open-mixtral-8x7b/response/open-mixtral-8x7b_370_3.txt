To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Now, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to identify the attacker's height and the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is also 80% or 0.8.
- P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(B|A') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

We can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is:

{probability: 0.345}
