Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(185 cm | witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness statement)

We are given P(185 cm) = 0.15, and P(witness statement | 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Now we need to calculate P(witness statement). This can be broken down into two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that in both cases, the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a 20% error rate. So:

P(witness statement | shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(witness statement | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm)
P(witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(185 cm | witness statement):

P(185 cm | witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness statement)
P(185 cm | witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
