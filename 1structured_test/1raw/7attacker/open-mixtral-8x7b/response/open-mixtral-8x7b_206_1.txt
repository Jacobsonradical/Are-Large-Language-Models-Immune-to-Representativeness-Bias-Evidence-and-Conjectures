To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information provided, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter, this means that given someone who is not 185 cm or taller, the witness will incorrectly identify them as such 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 times)

Now we can calculate P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17 ≈ 0.2745

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.2745 ≈ 0.3641

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3641.
