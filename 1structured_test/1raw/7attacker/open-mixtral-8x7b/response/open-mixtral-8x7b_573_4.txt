To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probability of an event (A) to the probability of another event (B), via the formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases where the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) = 0.454

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.454.
