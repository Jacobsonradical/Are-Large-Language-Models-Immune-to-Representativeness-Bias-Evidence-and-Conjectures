To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A'). 

P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since if the person is not 185 cm or taller, the witness will either correctly identify them as shorter or mistakenly identify them as 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
