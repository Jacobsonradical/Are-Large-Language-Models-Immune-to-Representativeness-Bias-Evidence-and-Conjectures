To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information given, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was NOT 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)
P(¬A) = 1 - 0.15
P(¬A) = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
