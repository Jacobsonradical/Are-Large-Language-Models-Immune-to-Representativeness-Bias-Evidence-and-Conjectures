To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

We will use the formula for total probability:

P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

where A is the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was NOT 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate:

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A')
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.29}.
