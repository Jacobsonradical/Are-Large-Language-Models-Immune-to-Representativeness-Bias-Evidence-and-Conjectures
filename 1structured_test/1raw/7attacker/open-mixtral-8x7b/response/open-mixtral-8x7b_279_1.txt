To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller
- P(A' ): probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm
- P(B' | A' ): probability that the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 1
