To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find P(B|A), which is the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%) in the question.

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller. This is the probability of a false positive, given as 0.2 (20%) in the question.

Then, we need to find P(A), which is the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15%) in the question.

Lastly, we need to find P(not A), which is the prior probability of the attacker's height not being 185 cm or taller. This is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.5172413793103448

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5172 (51.72%).
