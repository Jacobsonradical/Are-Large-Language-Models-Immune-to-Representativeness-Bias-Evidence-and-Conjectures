To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

First, let's calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is our prior probability:
P(A) = probability of being 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(B|A) = probability of identifying as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually not 185 cm or taller:
P(B|not A) = probability of identifying as 185 cm or taller | actually not 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, my estimate is:
{probability: 0.4138}
