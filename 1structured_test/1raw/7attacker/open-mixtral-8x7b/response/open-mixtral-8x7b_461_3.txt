To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to estimate.
- P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (erroneous identification).
- P(¬A): The probability of the attacker's height NOT being 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(A) = 1 - P(¬A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now we can calculate Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate the denominator:

(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate the numerator:

(0.8 * 0.15) = 0.12

Finally, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
