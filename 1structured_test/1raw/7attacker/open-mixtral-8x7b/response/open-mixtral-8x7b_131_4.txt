To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem statement, we know:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (from a, 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the attacker's height 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
