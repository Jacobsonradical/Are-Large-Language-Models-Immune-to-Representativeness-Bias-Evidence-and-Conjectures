To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. Similarly, the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness reported that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate. This means that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

where A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is 80% accurate in identifying people as 185 cm or taller and 20% inaccurate, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.17

where 0.20 is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller and 0.85 is the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.

Finally, we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, as:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

= 0.80 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85)

= 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.14)

= 0.5625

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information is:

{probability: 0.5625}
