To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the true height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Since there is a 85% chance that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the true height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85))

Calculate the above expression, and the final answer is:

{probability: 0.545455, this is approximately 54.55%}
