To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

1. The base rate is given as 15%, which means that the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
2. The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability of this identification being correct.
4. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]
5. In our case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
6. Plugging in the values, we get: P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + (1-0.8) \* (1-0.15)]
7. Simplifying this expression, we get: P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.36.
