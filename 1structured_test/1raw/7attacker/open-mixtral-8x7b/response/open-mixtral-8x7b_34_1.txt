To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Based on the information provided,

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we calculate the total probability:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.29}
