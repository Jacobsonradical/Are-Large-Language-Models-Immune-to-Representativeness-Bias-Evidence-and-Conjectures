To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. This is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller if the witness didn't make any errors.

Next, we need to account for the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified people who were 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erred (identified as 185 cm or taller when they were not) 20% of the time. 

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

where:

* P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
* P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85)
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8)
* P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.2)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.18

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.18.
