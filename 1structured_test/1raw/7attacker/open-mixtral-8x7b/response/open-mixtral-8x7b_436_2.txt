To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller

We have: P(B) = 0.15, P(W|A) = 0.8, and P(W|¬A) = 0.2

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since we don't have specific information about the attacker other than what the witness reported, we'll assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be above or below 185 cm. Therefore, P(¬A) = P(A) = 0.5.

Now, we can compute P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
