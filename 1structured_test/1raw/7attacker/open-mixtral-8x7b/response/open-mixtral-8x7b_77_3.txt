To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs in light of evidence. 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence (the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller).

From the given data, we have:
- P(B|A) = probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from part a)
- P(A) = probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from part b, 15% of the population)

We need to find P(B), the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)    (from part a, the false positive rate is 20%)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
