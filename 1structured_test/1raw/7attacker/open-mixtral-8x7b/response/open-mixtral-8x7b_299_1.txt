To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from point a)
P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness = 0.8 (from point b)
P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is NOT 185 cm or taller is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness = 0.2 (from point b, this is the error rate)
P(not A) is the probability that a random person is NOT 185 cm or taller = 0.85 (from point a)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
