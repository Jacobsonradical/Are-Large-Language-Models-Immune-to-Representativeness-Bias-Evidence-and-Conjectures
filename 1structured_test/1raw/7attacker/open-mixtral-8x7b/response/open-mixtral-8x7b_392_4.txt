To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define our terms:

- Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the observed data, which consists of two pieces of information:
  - 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
  - A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a reliability of 80%.

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the observed data.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the following probabilities:

- P(D|H): the probability of observing the given data if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(D|H'): the probability of observing the given data if the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
- P(H'): the prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(D|H), we consider that both pieces of data have to be satisfied for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. The first piece of data is guaranteed, but the second piece has a reliability of 80%. Therefore:

P(D|H) = 1 * 0.8 = 0.8

To calculate P(D|H'), we have to consider the probabilities of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness has a 20% error rate, and half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness making an error is:

0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Therefore, P(D|H') = 0.1.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|H') * P(H')]

P(H|D) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]

P(H|D) â‰ˆ 0.5789 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5789}
