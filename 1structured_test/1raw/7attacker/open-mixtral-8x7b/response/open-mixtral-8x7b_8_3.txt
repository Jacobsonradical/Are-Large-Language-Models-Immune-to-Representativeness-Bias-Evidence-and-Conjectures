To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, which is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know that P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|not A) = 0.2, and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
