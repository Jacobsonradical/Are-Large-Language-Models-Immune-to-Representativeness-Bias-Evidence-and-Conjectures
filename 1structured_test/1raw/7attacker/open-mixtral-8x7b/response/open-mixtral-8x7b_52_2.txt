To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (complementary probability of A)

From the given information, we know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(A') = 0.85
- P(¬A) = 0.15

Now, we can find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

0.8 = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.15)

Solving for P(A), we find:
P(A) = (0.8 - 0.03) / 0.8
P(A) = 0.775

However, since P(A) represents the probability that the attacker's height is exactly 185 cm, the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This information is already provided as P(A) since the attacker's height can only be 185 cm or taller if the witness identified the attacker correctly.

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.775}
