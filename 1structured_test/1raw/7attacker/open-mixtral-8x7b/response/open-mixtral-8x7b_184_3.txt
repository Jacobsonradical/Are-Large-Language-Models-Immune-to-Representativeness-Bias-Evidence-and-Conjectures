To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's denote:
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- H: the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller

We are interested in calculating P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified him as such.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when it is actually 185 cm or taller)
2. P(E|H') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when it is not 185 cm or taller)
3. P(H') = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
4. P(H) = 1 - P(H') = 0.85 (since the total probability must be 1)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H')]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.85] / [(0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15)]
P(H|E) = 0.68 

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68 (or 68%).
