To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 1 (the witness will always identify the correct height if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.4286 or 42.86%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 42.86%.
