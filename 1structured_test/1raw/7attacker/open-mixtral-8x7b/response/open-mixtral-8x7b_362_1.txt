To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm
- P(S): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 185 cm
- P(S'): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller

According to the given information, P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|A') = 0.2, P(S) = 0.85, and P(S') = 0.15.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are interested in estimating P(A) based on the given information.

To do so, we can consider two cases:

1. P(A) = 1, meaning the attacker is definitely 185 cm or taller.
2. P(A) = 0, meaning the attacker is definitely shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem for both cases and equating them, we get:

P(A) = P(A|W) * P(W) / P(W|A) = (1 - P(A|W)) * P(W') / P(W|A')

Rearranging for P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 1 / (1 + P(W') / (P(W|A) * P(A)))

Now, we need to estimate P(W) and P(W').

Assuming that the witness's ability to judge height is independent of the attacker's actual height, we can estimate P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A').

Using the fact that P(A') = 1 - P(A), we can simplify:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * (1 - P(A))

Similarly, we can estimate P(W') as:

P(W') = P(W|A') * P(A) + P(W|A) * (1 - P(A))

Now, we can substitute P(W) and P(W') into the equation for P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 1 / (1 + (P(W|A) * (1 - P(A))) / (P(W|A') * P(A) + P(W|A) * (1 - P(A))))

We can now plug in the given values and solve numerically for P(A). After solving, we get:

P(A) â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.22}
