To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B.

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(A) = 15% (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 80% (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

P(B|¬A) = 15% (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was NOT 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is NOT 185 cm or taller, so the overall probability of the witness saying the person was 185 cm or taller when they were not is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 31.58%.
