To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height
- ~W as the event that the witness does not correctly identify the height

From the given information, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(~W|A) = 0.2, as well as P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(A), we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(W and A) / [P(W and A) + P(~W and A)]

We know that P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

To find P(~W and A), we can use the total probability theorem:

P(~W and A) = P(~W|A) * P(A) = (0.2) * (0.15) = 0.03

Now, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.12 / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.8

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
