To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, let event A be "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We know the following probabilities:
1. P(A): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15
2. P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
3. P(B|not A): The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
