Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time, which means they might incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Given these pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to find the true positive rate (TP) and the false positive rate (FP) for the witness's identifications.

True positive rate (TP) = Witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are: 0.8 (20% error rate subtracted from 100%)
False positive rate (FP) = Witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not: 0.2 (20% true positive rate kept)

Now, let's use the given information that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = (TP * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)) / ((TP * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)) + (FP * P(witness mistakenly identifies 185 cm or taller)))

We don't have the exact population numbers, but we can use the percentages given:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
