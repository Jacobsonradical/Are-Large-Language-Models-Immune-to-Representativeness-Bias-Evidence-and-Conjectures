To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "15% are 185 cm or taller." So, P(T) = 0.15, where T denotes the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and errs with 20% probability. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. We can denote this as P(W|T) = 0.8, where W denotes the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.2. We can denote this as P(W|not T) = 0.2.

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = (P(W|T) \* P(T)) / (P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|not T) \* P(not T))

We know that P(T) = 0.15, P(W|T) = 0.8, and P(W|not T) = 0.2. Also, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(not T) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
P(T|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(T|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(T|W) = 0.4137931 (rounded to 8 decimal places)

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
