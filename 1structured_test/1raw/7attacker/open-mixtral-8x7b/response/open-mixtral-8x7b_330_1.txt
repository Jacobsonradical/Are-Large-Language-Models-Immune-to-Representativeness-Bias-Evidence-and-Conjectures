To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% (from statement b). So, P(A) = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm: The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. So, P(B|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
