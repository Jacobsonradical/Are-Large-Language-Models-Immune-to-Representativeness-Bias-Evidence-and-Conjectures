To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics (a) and the witness's reliability (b).

First, let's consider the base rate, or the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to (a). However, the witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which, given their 80% accuracy rate, means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the base rate.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (in this case, the witness's statement) is equal to the product of the likelihood of the evidence given the event and the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are trying to find P(A|E), the probability of A given E.

From (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2. Therefore, the likelihood of the evidence given the event is:

P(E|A) = 0.8

The likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller is:

P(E|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2)

From (a), we know that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

P(A) = 0.15

The prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller is:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

The probability of the evidence is:

P(E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|not A) \* P(not A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
