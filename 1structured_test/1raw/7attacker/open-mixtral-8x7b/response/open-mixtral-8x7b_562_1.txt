To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is equivalent to the sum of the products of P(B|C) and P(C) for all possible heights (C). 

Since the witness is equally likely to make a mistake for people shorter than 185 cm as they are to correctly identify people 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(B|C) = 0.2 for people shorter than 185 cm, and 
P(B|C) = 0.8 for people 185 cm or taller.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B) = [0.2 * 0.85] + [0.8 * 0.15] = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
