To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
We already know P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
For P(B and not A), it's the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2 of the population that is shorter than 185 cm. So P(B and not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.345.
