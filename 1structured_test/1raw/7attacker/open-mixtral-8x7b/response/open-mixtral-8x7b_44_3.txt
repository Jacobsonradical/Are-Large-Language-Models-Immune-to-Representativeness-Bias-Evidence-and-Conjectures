To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, which is the observation made by the witness.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given:
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider all possibilities, i.e., both when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Let B represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B).

We are given:
P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
P(E|B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into the expression for P(E), we get:
P(E) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
