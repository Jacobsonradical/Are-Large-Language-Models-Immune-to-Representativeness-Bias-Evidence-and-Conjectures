To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's ability to accurately identify a person as 185 cm or taller.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. However, they also erroneously identify someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
