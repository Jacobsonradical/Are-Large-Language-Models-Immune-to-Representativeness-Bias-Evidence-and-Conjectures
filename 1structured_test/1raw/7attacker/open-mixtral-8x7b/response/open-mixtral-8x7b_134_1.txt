To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, we can say:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)

However, the witness also errs 20% of the time:
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We can now calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Here, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 and P(W|¬A) = 0.2. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.36

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
