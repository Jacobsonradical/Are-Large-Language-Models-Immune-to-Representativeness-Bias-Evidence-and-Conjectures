To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
