To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of hypothesis A (the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) given evidence E (witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can compute the probability:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|E) = 0.4137931 (rounded to 0.414)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.414}
