To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the prior probability, i.e., the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, based on the given population statistics:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, we need to account for the witness's reliability in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can express this as:
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that they indeed are)
P(B'|A') = 20% = 0.2 (probability of the witness identifying the person as shorter than 185 cm given that they are actually shorter)

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, by using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

We need to find P(B|A'), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(A') = 85% = 0.85
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
