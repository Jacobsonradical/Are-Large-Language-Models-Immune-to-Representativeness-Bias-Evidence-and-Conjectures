To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the statement "85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller." So, the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the accuracy of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the likelihood that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

To calculate P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both the true positives (when the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (when the witness erroneously identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller).

P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
