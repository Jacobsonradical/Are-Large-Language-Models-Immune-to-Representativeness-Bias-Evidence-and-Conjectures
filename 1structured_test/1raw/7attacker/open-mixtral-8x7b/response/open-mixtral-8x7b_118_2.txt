To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(A') = 0.15 (the probability that a person is NOT 185 cm or taller is 15%)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
= (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.4474

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4474 or 44.74%.
