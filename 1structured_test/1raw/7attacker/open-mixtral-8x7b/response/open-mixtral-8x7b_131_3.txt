To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
= 0.12 / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4535.
