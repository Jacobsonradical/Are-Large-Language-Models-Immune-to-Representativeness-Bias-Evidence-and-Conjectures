To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the quantity we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We need to find P(A) to calculate P(A|B). Since the witness is equally likely to be correct or incorrect, P(A) = P(B), which is 15% or 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
