To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (from population statistics)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Calculate the probabilities:

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Plug the numbers into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) ≈ 0.5982

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5982}
