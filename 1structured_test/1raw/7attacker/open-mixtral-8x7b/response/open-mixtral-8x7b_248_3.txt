To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (A) and the witness identifying the attacker's height correctly (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and where it is not. Let's denote the event "the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller" as ~A. Then, P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We are also given that the witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time when it is not 185 cm or taller: P(B|~A) = 0.8.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.8*0.85) = 0.84.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.1429.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1429, or 14.29%.
