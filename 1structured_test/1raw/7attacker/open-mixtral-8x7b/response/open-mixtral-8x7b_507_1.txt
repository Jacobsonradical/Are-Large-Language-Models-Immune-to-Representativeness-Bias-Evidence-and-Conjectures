To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = P(being at least 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(correctly identifying the height)|(attacker is at least 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is at least 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = P(incorrectly identifying the height)|(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)] â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.3158.
