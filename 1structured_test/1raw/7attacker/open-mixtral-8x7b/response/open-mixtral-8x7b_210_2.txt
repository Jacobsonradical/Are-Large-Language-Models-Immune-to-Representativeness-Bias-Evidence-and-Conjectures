To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population data.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that they correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. This means that the witness's testimony provides some evidence towards the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, but it's not definitive.

Next, let's consider the population data. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information suggests that it is relatively uncommon for a person to be 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E be the evidence provided by the witness. Then:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E)

We are given P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we can calculate P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given P(E|A) = 0.8, and we can calculate P(E|not A) using the witness's error rate of 20%:

P(E|not A) = 1 - P(not E|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We are also given that P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). Therefore:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
