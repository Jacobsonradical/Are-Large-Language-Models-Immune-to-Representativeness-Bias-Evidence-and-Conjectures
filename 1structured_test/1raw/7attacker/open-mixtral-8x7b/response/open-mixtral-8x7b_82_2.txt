To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the city's population statistics. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

The third component is P(B|not A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This probability can be calculated as the product of the complement of P(A) (i.e., the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) and the error rate of the witness.

P(B|not A) = P(not A) * 0.2 = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.207

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.207 â‰ˆ 0.579

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.579}.
