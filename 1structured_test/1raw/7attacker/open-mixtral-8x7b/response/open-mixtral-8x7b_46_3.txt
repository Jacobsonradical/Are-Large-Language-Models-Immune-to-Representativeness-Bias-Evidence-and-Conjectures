To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (let's call this scenario A).
2. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (scenario B).

We want to find the probability of scenario B.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller. However, we cannot directly use these percentages as probabilities because the witness's ability to accurately judge a person's height affects the probability.

To account for the witness's ability to judge a person's height, let's introduce a likelihood ratio. Let L be the likelihood ratio of observing the witness's statement given scenario B over observing the statement given scenario A:

L = P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (0.8) and errs in 20% of the cases (0.2). Using this information, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

L = (0.8) / (1 - 0.8) / (0.2) / (1 - 0.2) = 4

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of scenario B (attacker is 185 cm or taller) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B | witness says "185 cm or taller") = P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | B) * P(B) / P(witness says "185 cm or taller")

We are interested in the posterior probability P(B | witness says "185 cm or taller"). Since scenario A and scenario B are complementary events, their prior probabilities sum to 1. Therefore, P(B) = 0.15 and P(A) = 0.85.

We can simplify the equation by eliminating the term P(witness says "185 cm or taller") from both the numerator and the denominator, which results in:

P(B | witness says "185 cm or taller") = P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | B) * P(B) / [P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | B) * P(B) + P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | A) * P(A)]

Using the likelihood ratio L, we can simplify the equation further:

P(B | witness says "185 cm or taller") = (L * P(B)) / [L * P(B) + P(A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B | witness says "185 cm or taller") = (4 * 0.15) / [(4 * 0.15) + 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.368

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.368 or 36.8%.
