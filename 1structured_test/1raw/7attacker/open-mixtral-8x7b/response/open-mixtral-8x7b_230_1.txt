To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that they were identified as such by the witness.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We need to find P(B|not A). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. The witness erred 20% of the time when judging height, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, let's compute P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can compute P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
