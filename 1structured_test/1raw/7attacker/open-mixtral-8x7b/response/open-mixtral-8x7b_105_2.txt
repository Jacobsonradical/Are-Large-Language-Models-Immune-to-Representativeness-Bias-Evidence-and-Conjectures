To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(The attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(The witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such) = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = P(The witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% of the time)
P(not A) = P(The attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [(0.8)*(0.15)] / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
