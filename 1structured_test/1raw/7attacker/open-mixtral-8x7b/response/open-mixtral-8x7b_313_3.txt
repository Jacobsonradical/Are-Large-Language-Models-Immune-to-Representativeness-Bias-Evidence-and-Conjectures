To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we have:

P(A): probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2 (¬A represents the complement of event A, i.e., a random person being shorter than 185 cm)
P(B): probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = P(A)*P(B|A) + P(¬A)*P(B|¬A) = (0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.41) ≈ 0.293

Answer: {probability: 0.293}
