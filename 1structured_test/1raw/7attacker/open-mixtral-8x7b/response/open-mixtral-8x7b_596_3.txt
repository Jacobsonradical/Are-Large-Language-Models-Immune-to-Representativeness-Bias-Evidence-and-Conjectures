To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in the city and the witness's ability to accurately judge a person's height.

We have two pieces of information:

a) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
b) A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person) = 0.8

We also need to calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:

P(incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(identifying a shorter person as shorter)
P(identifying a shorter person as shorter) = 0.5 (given that there is an equal distribution of people shorter and taller than 185 cm in the sample)
P(incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller given the witness's correct identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified 185 cm or taller)

We have the following probabilities:

P(witness identified 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (given that the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
P(witness identified 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller given the witness's correct identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) * (0.15) / 0.545
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 0.012 / 0.545
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) â‰ˆ 0.022

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.022 or 2.2%.
