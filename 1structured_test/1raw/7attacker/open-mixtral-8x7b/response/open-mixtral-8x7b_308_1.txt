To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(A).

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. This means that P(not A) = 0.85, and therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

However, this is not the final answer because the witness's ability to judge height also plays a role. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have P(A) = 0.15 from the city's population distribution.

Now, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(B). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 0.85. To find P(B|not A), we need the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
