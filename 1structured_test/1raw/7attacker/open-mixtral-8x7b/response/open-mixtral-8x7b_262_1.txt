To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the given information.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We have been given:
1. P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(E|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases, implying that they incorrectly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(E), we need to calculate the total probability of event E, which includes both cases where the witness correctly identifies a person of height 185 cm or taller and where the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(E) = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
