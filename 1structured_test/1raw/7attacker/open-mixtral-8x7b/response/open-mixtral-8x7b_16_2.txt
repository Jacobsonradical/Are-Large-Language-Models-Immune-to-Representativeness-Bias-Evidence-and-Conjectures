To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: A witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B and not A) = 1 - (0.85 * 0.5) = 0.65 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Then, we can find P(not B) = P(not B and not A) * P(not A) + P(not B and A) * P(A) = 0.65 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.5725

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.65 * 0.85)
= 0.12

Format answer:
{probability: 0.12}
