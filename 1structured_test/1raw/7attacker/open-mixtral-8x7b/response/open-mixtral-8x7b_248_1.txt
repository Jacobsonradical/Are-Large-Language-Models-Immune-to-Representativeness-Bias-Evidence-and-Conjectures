To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(W):

P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.80) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.20) * (0.85) = 0.17

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.12) / (0.29) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
