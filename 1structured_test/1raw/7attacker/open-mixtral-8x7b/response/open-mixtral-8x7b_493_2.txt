To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is not actually that tall)

Now, calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
