To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. We have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. And P(A) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 from statement (b).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the case where it is not. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|not A), we can use the complementary probability: P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, since the witness erred in 20% of the cases where the person is not 185 cm or taller. And P(not A) is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 from statement (b).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
