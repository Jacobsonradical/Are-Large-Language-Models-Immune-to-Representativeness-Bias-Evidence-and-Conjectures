To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics to calculate a conditional probability.

Let's denote:

* A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given:

* P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was actually 185 cm or taller.
* P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.

However, we are missing P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) and when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (A').

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

We are given P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|A'), we can use the witness's error rate. The witness erred 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|A') = 0.2.

We are also given P(A'), which is 85% for the city's population.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
