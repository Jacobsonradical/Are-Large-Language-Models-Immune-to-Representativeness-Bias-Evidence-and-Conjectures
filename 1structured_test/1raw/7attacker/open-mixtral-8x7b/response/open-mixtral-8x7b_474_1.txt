To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after obtaining new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which according to the city's statistics is 15%.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. 

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, substitute the values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now, calculate:
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2766 / (0.2766 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.6176

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.62 or 62%.
