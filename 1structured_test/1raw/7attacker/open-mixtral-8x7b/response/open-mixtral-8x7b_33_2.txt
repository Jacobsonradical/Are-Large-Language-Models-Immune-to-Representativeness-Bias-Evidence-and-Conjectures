To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the city's population:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time
- The witness errs and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not 80% of the time

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(185|witness) = P(witness|185) * P(185) / P(witness)

We're given the following probabilities:
- P(185) = 0.15 (the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(witness|185) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(witness), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(witness) = P(witness|185) * P(185) + P(witness|<185) * P(<185)

We're given P(witness|185) and P(185), but we need to find P(witness|<185), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, P(witness|<185) = 0.2.

We're also given P(<185) = 0.85 (the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(witness):

P(witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(185|witness):

P(185|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
