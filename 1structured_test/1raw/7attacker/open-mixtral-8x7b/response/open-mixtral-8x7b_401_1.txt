To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We are also given that when the witness is presented with a sample of people with half being 185 cm or taller, they correctly identify the height 80% of the time, and err 20% of the time. This means that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(¬B|A) = 0.2 (¬B denotes the complementary event of not being identified as 185 cm or taller). Similarly, for people who are shorter than 185 cm, the witness erroneously identifies them as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2 and P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, using the fact that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we know:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression yields:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.36.
