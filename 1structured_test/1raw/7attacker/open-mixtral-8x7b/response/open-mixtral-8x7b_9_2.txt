To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 0.85 probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm. Similarly, there's a 0.15 probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is correct 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
And P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = 0.8 x 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
