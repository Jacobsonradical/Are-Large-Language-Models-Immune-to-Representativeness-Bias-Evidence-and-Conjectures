To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

From the first statement, we know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This implies that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

The second statement tells us that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred (identified someone as 185 cm or taller when they were not) 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here,
A represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85 (probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 20% or 0.2 (probability that the witness errs and identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when it is not)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
