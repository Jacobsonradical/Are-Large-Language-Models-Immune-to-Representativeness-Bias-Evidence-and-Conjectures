To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This can be written as P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|F) = 0.2, where W represents the witness correctly identifying the height, T represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and F represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

b) The population proportions of people who are 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm are 15% and 85%, respectively. This can be written as P(T) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(T|W) = (P(W|T) \* P(T)) / (P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F))

First, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use the law of total probability to find this:

P(W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (P(W|T) \* P(T)) / P(W)

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
