To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (P(A|B)), which is the probability of event A given evidence B, is calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the evidence provided by the witness.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15
- P(not A) = 85% = 0.85
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 20% * 0.5 = 0.1 (witness errs 20% of the time, and only half the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can compute P(B), which is the overall probability of observing the given evidence. Since we are only interested in whether the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller, we can compute:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85
     = 0.147

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.147
       = 0.0815

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.0815}.
