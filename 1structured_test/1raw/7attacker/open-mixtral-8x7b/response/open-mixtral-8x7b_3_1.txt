To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(W|S): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(C|T): Probability that the court concludes that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(C|S): Probability that the court concludes that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we know that:
- P(W|T) = 0.8
- P(W|S) = 0.2
- P(S) = 0.85

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(T):
P(T) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(C|T):
P(C|T) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
