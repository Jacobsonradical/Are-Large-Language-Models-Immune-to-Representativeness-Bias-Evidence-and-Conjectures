To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new available evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.15 according to the information given.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.8 according to the information given.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 according to the information given (probability of choosing someone shorter than 185 cm multiplied by the error rate).

Now, Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in our values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.55

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the new evidence, is approximately 0.55 or 55%.
