To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, 15% of the population falls into this category, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood of the evidence E (the witness's identification) under both scenarios - when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and when it's not.

If the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify it as such with 80% probability, and erroneously identify it as shorter with 20% probability. So, P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(~E|A) = 0.2.

If the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller, the witness will incorrectly identify the height as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability, and correctly identify it as shorter with 80% probability. So, P(E|~A) = 0.2 and P(~E|~A) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(A|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]
P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.2766

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2766 or 27.66%.
