To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that they were identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (event B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we know:
P(A): Probability of a person being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80%)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(A) * P(B|A)] + [P(not A) * P(B|not A)]
= [0.15 * 0.8] + [0.85 * (1-0.8)]
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
