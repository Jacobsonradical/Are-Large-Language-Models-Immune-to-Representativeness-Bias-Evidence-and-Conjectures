To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(not A) as the probability that a person in the city is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345 or 34.5%.
