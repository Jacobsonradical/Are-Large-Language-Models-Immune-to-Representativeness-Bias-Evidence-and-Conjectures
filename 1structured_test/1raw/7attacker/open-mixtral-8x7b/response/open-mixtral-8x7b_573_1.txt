To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's break down the given information:
1. 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In our case:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We're looking for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We're given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
a) The witness is correct, and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
b) The witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm: P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can find P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ( (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) )

Performing the calculation, we find:

{probability: 0.5789, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 57.89%.
