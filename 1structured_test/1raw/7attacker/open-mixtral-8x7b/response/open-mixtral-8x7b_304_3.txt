To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
- P(A): 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A): 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

- P(B and A): probability of correct identification = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
- P(B and not A): probability of incorrect identification = (1 - 0.15) * 0.2 = 0.14 (since 80% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 or 46.15%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 46.15%.
