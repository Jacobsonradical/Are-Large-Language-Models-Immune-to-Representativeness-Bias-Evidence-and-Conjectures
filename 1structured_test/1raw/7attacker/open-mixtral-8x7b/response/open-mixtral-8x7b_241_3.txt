To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker's height is less than 185 cm (A'). We already know the probabilities related to event A. For event A', from the problem statement, the witness erred 20% of the time, which means the witness incorrectly identified someone as being 185 cm or taller when they were not, 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this error rate applies to 85% of the population, not the total population. So,

- P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and this applies to 85% of the population)

Now, we can calculate P(B), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'). Therefore,

- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
