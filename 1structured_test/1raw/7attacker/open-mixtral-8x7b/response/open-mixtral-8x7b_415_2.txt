To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there are two possibilities:
1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness is mistaken, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and mistaken 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|Witness) = P(Witness|A) * P(A) / P(Witness)

The probability of the witness making the statement (Witness) is a combination of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller (Witness and A) and the witness being mistaken when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (Witness and not A):

P(Witness) = P(Witness|A) * P(A) + P(Witness|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:

P(A|Witness) = P(Witness|A) * P(A) / P(Witness)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
