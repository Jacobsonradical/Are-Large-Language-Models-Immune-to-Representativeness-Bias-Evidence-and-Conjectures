To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, the event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the evidence B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 85% = 0.85 (since P(A) = 0.15)

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3448}
