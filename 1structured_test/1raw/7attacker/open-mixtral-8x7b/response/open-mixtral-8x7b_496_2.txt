To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will consider the two pieces of information given and calculate the posterior probability based on that.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From the given information:
P(B|A) = Witness accuracy, which is 0.8 (80% chance of being correct when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = Probability of someone being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population)

Now we need to calculate P(B), which requires calculating P(B|A') and P(A'), where A' is the complement of A (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm):

P(B|A') = Witness error rate, which is 0.2 (20% chance of incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)
P(A') = Probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
