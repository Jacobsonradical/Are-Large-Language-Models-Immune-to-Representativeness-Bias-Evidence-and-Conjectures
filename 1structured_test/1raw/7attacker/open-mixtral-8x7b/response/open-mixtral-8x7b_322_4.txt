To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|¬A) as the probability that a person who is shorter than 185 cm is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(¬A) as the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] ≈ 0.364.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 36.4%.
