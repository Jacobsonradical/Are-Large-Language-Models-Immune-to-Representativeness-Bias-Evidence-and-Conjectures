To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:

* P(A): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
* P(B|not A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time, and only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(not A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.767

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.767}
