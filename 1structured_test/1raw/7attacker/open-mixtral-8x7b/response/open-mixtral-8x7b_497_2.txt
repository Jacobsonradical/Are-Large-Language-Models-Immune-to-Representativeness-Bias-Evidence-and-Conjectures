To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability we want to find) is equal to the product of the likelihood and the prior, divided by the evidence.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the evidence, which includes the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence.

First, we need to find the prior probability, P(A). According to the information given, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood, P(B|A). This is the probability of observing the evidence (the witness's statement and ability), assuming that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the likelihood of observing the evidence if the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is given by P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Finally, we need to find the evidence, P(B). This is the overall probability of observing the evidence, regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.18 + 0.17
= 0.35

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability, P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.35
= 0.12 / 0.35
= 0.3429 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.3429}.
