Let's analyze the information given.

The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging a person's height under similar conditions.

Based on the given data, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.12}
