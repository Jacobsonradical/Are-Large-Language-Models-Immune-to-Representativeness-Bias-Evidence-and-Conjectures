To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population, which is 15%.
- P(W|T): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(W|¬T): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20%.

Now, we want to calculate P(T|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|¬T) * P(¬T)]

We know:
P(T) = 0.15
P(W|T) = 0.80
P(¬T) = 0.85 (1 - P(T))
P(W|¬T) = 0.20

Substituting the values:

P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(T|W) ≈ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 (37.5%).
