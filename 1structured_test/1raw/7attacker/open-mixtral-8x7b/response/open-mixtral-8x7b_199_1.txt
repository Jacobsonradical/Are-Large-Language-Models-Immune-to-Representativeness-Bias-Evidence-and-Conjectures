To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- Correctly identifies height 80% of the time: P(W|A) = 0.8
- Errs and says a shorter person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: P(W|¬A) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.36

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
