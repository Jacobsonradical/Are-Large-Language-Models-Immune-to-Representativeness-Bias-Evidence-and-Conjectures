To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the observation of the witness.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability of the observation given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (0.8) based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height.
- P(A): The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15) based on the city's population statistics.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two sub-events: B1 (the attacker is taller than 185 cm) and B2 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We know P(B1|A) and P(B2|not A), and their probabilities in the population.

P(B) = P(B1) + P(B2)
= [P(B1|A) * P(A)] + [P(B2|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [(1 - 0.2) * 0.85]
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
= 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.
