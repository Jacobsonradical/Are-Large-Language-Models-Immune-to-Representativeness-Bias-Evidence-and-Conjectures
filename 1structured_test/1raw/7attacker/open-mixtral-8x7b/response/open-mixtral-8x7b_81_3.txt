To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- Event A as "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B as "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B.

According to the information provided, we know:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness mistakenly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values, we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3846

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 38.46%.
