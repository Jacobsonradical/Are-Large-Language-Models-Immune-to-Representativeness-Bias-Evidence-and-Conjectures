To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's consider the base rate. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the reliability of the witness. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the witness's testimony provides some evidence in favor of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, but it's not conclusive evidence.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the base rate with the witness's testimony. We can do this using Bayes' theorem, which states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We already know P(A), the base rate, which is 0.15. We also know that P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are, is 0.8 (the witness's reliability).

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the true positives (when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them) and the false positives (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller).

The probability of a true positive is P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of a false positive is P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B) = true positives + false positives = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345, or 34.5%.
