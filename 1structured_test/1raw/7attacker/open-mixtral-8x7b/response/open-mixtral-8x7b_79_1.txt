To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we have P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A), and when it is shorter than 185 cm (A'). We have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. For P(B|A'), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, we can use the witness's error rate. The witness erred in 20% of the cases, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(A') = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
