To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies correctly) = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness errs when the person is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to find P(¬A):
1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = P(witness errs) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138 or 41.38%.
