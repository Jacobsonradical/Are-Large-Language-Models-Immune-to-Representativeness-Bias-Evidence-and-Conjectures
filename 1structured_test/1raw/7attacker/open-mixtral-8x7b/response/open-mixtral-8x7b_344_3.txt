To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

Let's start with the prior probability, P(A), which is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller. According to (a), 15% of the population fits this description, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's consider the evidence: a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, as stated in (b), the witness is only correct 80% of the time when making such judgments under the given conditions. Therefore, the probability of this evidence given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, P(E|A), is 0.8.

We also need to consider the possibility that the witness is incorrect. The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, P(E|B), can be calculated as follows:

1. The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.
2. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness stating that a person is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 0.2.

Therefore, P(E|B) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)]

Since P(B) = 1 - P(A), P(B) = 0.85.

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|E) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.4541

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.4541 or 45.41%.
