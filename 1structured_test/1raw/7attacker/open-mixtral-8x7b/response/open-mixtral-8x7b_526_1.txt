To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A): the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A is true), and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A is false).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + P(B|not A) * 0.85

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(B|not A) = 0.2

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
