To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find P(not B|not A), the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is not. Since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(not B|not A) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.12 or 12%.
