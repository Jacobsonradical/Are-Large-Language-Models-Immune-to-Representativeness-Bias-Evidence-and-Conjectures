To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the observed evidence, which is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each possible height category, multiplied by their respective probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A). To calculate P(B|not A), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is given as the complement of the witness's accuracy, so P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We also know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
