To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Given a person who is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time. Similarly, given a person who is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will mistakenly identify them as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.255

Therefore, P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.47

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.47.
