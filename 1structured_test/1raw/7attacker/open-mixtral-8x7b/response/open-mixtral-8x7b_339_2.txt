To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A) given the available information.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Therefore, we can say that the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 or 80%. We can denote this probability as P(W|A).

Similarly, we can say that the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm), is 0.2 or 20%. We can denote this probability as P(W|¬A).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can say that the prior probability of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%. We can denote this probability as P(A).

To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) \* P(A)) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A))

We are given:

* P(W|A) = 0.8
* P(A) = 0.15
* P(W|¬A) = 0.2
* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Solving for P(A|W), we get:

P(A|W) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
