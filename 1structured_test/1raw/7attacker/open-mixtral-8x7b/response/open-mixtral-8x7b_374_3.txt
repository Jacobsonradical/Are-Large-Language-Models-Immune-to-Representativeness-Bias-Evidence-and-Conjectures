To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8: the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* P(B|not A) = 0.2: the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller (but shorter than 185 cm).
* P(not A) = 0.15: the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

To find P(A), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B)

We know that:

* P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* P(A)
* P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We can find P(B and not A) using the law of total probability:

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.15 = 0.03

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.03.

Now we can find P(A):

P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* P(A)) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.03)

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.0375) = 0.8 / 0.8375 â‰ˆ 0.955

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.955}
