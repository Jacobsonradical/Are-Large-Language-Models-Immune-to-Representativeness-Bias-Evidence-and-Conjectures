To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
2. 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A): Probability that a random person in the city is NOT 185 cm or taller = 0.85
- P(¬B): Probability that the witness does NOT identify a person as 185 cm or taller when they truly are = 0.2 (when the true height is less than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, we need to calculate P(B|¬A) which is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when the true height is less than 185 cm (20% accuracy):
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.45 / (0.45 + 0.17) = 0.45 / 0.62 ≈ 0.7258

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7258 or 73%.
