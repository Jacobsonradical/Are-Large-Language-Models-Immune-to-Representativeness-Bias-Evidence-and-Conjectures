To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and O represent the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|O), the probability of A given O.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

First, let's find P(O|A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A): the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(O), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit more complicated because it includes both the true positives (attackers who are 185 cm or taller and are correctly identified) and false positives (attackers who are shorter than 185 cm but are incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller).

P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|not A) * P(not A)

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 20% or 0.2 (according to the information provided). The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85. So,

P(O|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(O):

P(O) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.187

Finally, we can calculate P(A|O):

P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.187 â‰ˆ 0.6417

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6417 or 64.17%.
