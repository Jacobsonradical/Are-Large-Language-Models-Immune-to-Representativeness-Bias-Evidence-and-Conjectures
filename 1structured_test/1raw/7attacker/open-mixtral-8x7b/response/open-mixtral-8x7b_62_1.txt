To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the available information, we have:

P(A): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A'): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B|A): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2
P(A'): Probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller = 85% = 0.85

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
