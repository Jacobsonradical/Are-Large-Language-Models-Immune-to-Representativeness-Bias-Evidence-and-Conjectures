To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller",
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we know the following probabilities:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 50% = 0.5 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies the height correctly 80% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller, so the overall probability of them identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 100% - 80% = 20%, and due to the 50-50 split in the population, the final probability is 20% * 50% + 80% * 50% = 0.5)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.1652

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 16.52%.
