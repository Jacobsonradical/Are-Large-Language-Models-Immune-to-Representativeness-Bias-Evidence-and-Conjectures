To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We will use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15
- P(not A) = 85% = 0.85
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
