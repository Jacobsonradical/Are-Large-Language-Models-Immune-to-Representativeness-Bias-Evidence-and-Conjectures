To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
