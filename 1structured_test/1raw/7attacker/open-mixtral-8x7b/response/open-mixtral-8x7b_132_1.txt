To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (P(A|B)), which is the probability of event A given evidence B, is equal to the product of the likelihood (P(B|A)) and the prior probability (P(A)), divided by the marginal likelihood (P(B)).

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% error)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find the marginal likelihood P(B), which is the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
