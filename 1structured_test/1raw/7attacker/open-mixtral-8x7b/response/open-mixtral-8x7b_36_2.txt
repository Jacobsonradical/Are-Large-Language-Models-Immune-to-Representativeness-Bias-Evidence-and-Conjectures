To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information provided, we know:
1. P(A): Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city = 15% or 0.15 (from statement a)
2. P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 80% or 0.8 (from statement b)
3. P(B|not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller = 20% or 0.2 (100% - 80% from statement b)
4. We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller or not.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and where the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (not A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
