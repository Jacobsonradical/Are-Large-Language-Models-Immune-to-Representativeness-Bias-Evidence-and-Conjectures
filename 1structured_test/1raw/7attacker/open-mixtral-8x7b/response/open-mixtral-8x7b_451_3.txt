To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the height is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

However, since the problem is about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate 1 - P(A|B):
1 - P(A|B) = 1 - 0.345 ≈ 0.655

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.655}
