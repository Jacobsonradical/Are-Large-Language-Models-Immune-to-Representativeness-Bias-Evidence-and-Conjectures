To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the observed evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: P(E|A) = 0.8

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller: P(A) = 0.15

To find P(E), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 1
