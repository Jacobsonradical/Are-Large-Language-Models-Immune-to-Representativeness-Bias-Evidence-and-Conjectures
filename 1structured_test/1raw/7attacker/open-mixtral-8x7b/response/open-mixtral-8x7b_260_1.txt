To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, which is the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From the problem, we are given:
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%)
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% of the population)

We need to find P(E), the probability of the evidence, which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a person correctly and identifying a person incorrectly:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
