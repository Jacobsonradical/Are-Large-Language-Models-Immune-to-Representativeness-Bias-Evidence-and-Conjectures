To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Our prior probability (before considering the witness's testimony) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. According to statement a, 15% of the population fits this description, so our prior probability is 0.15.

The witness's testimony provides new evidence. The witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which turns out to be correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time (according to statement b). We can express this as two conditional probabilities:
