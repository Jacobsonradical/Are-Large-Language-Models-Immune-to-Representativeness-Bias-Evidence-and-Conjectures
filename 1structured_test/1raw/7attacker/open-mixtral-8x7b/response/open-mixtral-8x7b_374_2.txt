To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to point b.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to point a.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.8 according to point a.
- P(A') as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 according to point b.
- P(B|A') as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to point a.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

Substituting the values we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
