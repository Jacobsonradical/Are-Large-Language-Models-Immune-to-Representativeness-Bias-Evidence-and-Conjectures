To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the reliable witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"
- C as the event "the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller"

From the given information, we have:
P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

However, we want P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

We still need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two cases: the witness is correct (C) and the witness is incorrect (C'). Hence,

P(B) = P(B ∩ C) + P(B ∩ C')
= P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(C|B):

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
