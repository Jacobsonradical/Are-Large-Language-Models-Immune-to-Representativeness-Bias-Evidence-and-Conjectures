To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given evidence B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and evidence B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
