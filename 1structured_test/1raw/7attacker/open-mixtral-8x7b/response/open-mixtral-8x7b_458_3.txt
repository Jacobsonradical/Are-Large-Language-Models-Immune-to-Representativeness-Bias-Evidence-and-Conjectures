To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we have the following probabilities based on the city's population:
- P(shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85
- P(185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15

Next, we have the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- P(correctly identifying 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
- P(incorrectly identifying shorter as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(185 cm or taller | witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness statement)

We need to calculate P(witness statement) using Bayes' theorem:
P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness statement | shorter than 185 cm) \* P(shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(witness statement | shorter than 185 cm), we need to consider the witness's error rate. If the true height is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify the height as 185 cm or taller:
P(witness statement | shorter than 185 cm) = P(incorrectly identifying shorter as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(witness statement):
P(witness statement) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(185 cm or taller | witness statement) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
