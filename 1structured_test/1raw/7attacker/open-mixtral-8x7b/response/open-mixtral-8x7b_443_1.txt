To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

First, let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability of event A.

Using the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we can calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

Similarly, we can calculate P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

We can also calculate P(¬A), the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we calculated above, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.4286, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 42.86%.
