To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and event B be the observation that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 1 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 1 * 0.15 / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.46875 (46.875%).
