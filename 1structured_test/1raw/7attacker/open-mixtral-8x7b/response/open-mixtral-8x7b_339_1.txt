To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)

P(E|not A) = 0.2*(1-0.15) = 0.16 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(E|not A) * P(not A):

P(E|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17] = 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 31.58%.
