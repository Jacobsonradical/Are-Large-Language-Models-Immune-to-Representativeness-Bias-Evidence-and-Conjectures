To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller. We also know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller if they erred in their judgment. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, they would incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time as well.

Given that the attacker's height is unknown, we need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35)
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.343.
