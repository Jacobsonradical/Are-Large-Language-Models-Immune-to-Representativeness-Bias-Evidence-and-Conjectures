To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- D: the observed data, which includes the witness's statement and the population statistics.

We are asked to find P(H|D), the probability of H given the data D.

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(D|H) =
