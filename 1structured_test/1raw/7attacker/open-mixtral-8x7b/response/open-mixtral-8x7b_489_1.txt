To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to perform Bayesian updating. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the information provided.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 0.8 based on the information provided.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is NOT 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness, which is 0.2 (erroneous identification rate, since the witness thinks 20% of people who are shorter than 185 cm are 185 cm or taller).

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Solving this expression, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
