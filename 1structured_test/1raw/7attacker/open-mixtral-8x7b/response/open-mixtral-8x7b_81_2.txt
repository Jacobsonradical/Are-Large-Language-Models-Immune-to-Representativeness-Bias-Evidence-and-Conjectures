To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 100% of the time when the actual height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the actual height is less than 185 cm)
P(not A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|B) = 0.46875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.46875}
