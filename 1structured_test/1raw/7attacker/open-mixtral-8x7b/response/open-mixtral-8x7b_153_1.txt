To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified them as such (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided,
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which we need to calculate.

We can calculate P(B) by summing over all possibilities: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + [1 - P(not B|not A)] * (1 - 0.15)

The term P(not B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is given as 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
