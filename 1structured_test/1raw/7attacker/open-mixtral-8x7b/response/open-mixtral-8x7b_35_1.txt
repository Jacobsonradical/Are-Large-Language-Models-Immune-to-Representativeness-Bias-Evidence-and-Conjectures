To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm. This means that there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.

However, the witness's ability to judge a person's height introduces some uncertainty into our estimate. According to the witness, there is an 80% chance that they would correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance that they would erroneously identify a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that.

To account for both pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (when the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (when the witness erroneously identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that).

Let TP be the number of true positives and FP be the number of false positives. Then:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

where A' is the complement of A (the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and P(B|A') is the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that.

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 50% of the time (regardless of whether they are shorter or taller than 185 cm), and errs 50% of the time. This means that:

P(B|A') = 0.5

and:

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.5 \* 0.85) = 0.535

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.535 â‰ˆ 0.217

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 21.7%.
