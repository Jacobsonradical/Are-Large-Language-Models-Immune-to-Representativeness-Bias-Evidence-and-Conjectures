To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

First, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The problem states that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are in similar conditions. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. The problem states that the witness errs 20% of the time when determining a person's height. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we need to calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. According to the problem, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(not A) = 0.85.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
