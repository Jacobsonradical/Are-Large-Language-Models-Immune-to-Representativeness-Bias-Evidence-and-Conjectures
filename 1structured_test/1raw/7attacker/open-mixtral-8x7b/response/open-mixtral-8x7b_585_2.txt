To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided by the witness and the general population statistics.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, as stated in the problem)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A). We need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

When the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the false positive rate).

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
