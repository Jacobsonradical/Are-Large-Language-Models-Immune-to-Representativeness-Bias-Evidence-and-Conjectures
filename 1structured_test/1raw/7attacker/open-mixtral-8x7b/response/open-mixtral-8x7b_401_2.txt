To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's statement. According to the given information, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So the prior probability is:
