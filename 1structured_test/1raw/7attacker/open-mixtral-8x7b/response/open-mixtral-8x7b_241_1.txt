To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(A') = Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
P(B|A') = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(A') = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we calculate:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15]

However, we don't have the prior probability P(A). To proceed, we can make an assumption, such as assuming that the attacker is equally likely to be of any height in the population. In this case, P(A) = P(A'), and:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
