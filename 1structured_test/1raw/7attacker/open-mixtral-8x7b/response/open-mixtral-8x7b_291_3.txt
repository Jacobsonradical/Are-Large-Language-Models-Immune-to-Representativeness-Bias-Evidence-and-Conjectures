To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics (a) and the witness's accuracy (b).

We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our prior probability.

However, we also have information from a witness who is correct 80% of the time. This additional information will affect our prior probability. The witness incorrectly identifies people as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%).

P(not A) is the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.36

So, given the information about the population and the witness, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36 (36%).
