To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, or the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller without any other information, based on the city's population. According to the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability is:

p(A) = 0.15

Next, let's consider the sensitivity (true positive rate) and the false positive rate. The sensitivity, given by the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, is:

sensitivity = 0.8 (80% of the time)

The false positive rate, given by the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, is:

false positive rate = 1 - sensitivity = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability, or the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = p(A|witness) = [p(witness|A) * p(A)] / p(witness)

We are interested in the numerator of this equation, considering the sensitivity and the prior probability:

numerator = p(witness|A) * p(A) = (0.8) * (0.15)

The denominator, p(witness), represents the total probability of the witness's statement, which can be calculated as:

p(witness) = p(witness and A) + p(witness and not A)

The first term, p(witness and A), can be calculated as:

p(witness and A) = p(witness|A) * p(A) = (0.8) * (0.15)

The second term, p(witness and not A), can be calculated as:

p(witness and not A) = p(witness|not A) * p(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85)

Now, we can calculate the denominator:

denominator = p(witness) = p(witness and A) + p(witness and not A) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

posterior probability = p(A|witness) = numerator / denominator = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / {[(0.8) * (0.15)] + [(0.2) * (0.85)]} â‰ˆ 0.3659

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3659}
