To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)] â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3158}
