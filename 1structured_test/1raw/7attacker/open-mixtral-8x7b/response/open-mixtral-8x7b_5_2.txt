To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's height.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when presented with a sample containing an equal number of people below and above 185 cm.
3. However, the witness also erred 20% of the time, which means that sometimes they incorrectly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller even when they were not.

Given that the victim could not see the attacker's height, the total relevant population for our estimation is the entire city's population. To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can perform a calculation using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here,
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Now let's compute the probabilities:
- P(A) = 15% (15/100 or 0.15, as given in the question)
- P(not A) = 85% (85/100 or 0.85)
- P(B|A) = 80% (0.8, since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 20% (0.2, since the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness' identification:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
