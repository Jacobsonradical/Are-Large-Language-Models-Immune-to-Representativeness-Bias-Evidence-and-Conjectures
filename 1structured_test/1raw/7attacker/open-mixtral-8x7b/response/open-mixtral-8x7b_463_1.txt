To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
