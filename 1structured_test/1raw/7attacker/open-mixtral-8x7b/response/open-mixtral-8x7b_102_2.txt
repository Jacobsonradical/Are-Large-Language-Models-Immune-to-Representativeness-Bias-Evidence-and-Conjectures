To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the population height distribution.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(¬A): probability of the complement of event A, i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(A') = 0.85
- P(A) = 0.15

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, we need to compute P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this probability by considering both correct and incorrect identifications.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.3448

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
