To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the observed data, which is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have two pieces of information that can help us form our prior probabilities:
1. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are, and errs 20% of the time when they're not.
2. In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

From this, we can calculate the prior probability P(H), that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller:
P(H) = 0.15

We also need to calculate the probability of not-H, P(not-H):
P(not-H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the data D, given that the person is 185 cm or taller, P(D|H). This is the same as the true positive rate of the witness, which we know is 80% or 0.8.

We also need to calculate the probability of the data D, given that the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(D|not-H). This is the same as the false positive rate of the witness, which we know is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not-H) * P(not-H)]
P(H|D) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(H|D) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
