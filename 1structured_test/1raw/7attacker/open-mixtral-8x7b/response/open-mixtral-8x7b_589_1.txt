To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:
P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
P(A): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

However, we do not have enough information to directly calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we need to consider both the true positives (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are) and the false positives (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Let TP be the event that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and TN be the event that the witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm. Let FP be the event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and FN be the event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.

We know:
P(TP) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
P(FP) = P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85

But we don't know P(A') (the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm) to calculate P(FP). However, since the city's population is divided almost equally between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can make a reasonable assumption that P(A') is close to 0.85.

With this assumption, we can estimate P(FP) as approximately 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(TP) + P(FP) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 ≈ 0.255.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.0706.

However, this is an approximation due to our assumption about P(A'). To reflect the uncertainty, we can provide a range of estimates by considering slightly different values of P(A'). For example, if P(A') were 0.84 or 0.86, the resulting estimate for P(A|B) would be approximately 0.065 or 0.077, respectively.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.065 - 0.077}
