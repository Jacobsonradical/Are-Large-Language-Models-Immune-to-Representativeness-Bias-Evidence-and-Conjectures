To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
