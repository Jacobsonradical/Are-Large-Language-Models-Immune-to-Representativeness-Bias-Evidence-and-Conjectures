To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% from given data)
- P(B|A) = P(the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since if the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify him as such)
- P(B|not A) = P(the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% chance of error from given data)
- P(not A) = P(the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% from given data)

Using Bayes' theorem, we find:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
â‰ˆ 0.2976 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2976}
