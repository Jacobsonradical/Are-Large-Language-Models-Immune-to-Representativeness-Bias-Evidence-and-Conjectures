To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.
2. The population distribution shows that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define two events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We have the following probabilities:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to find P(W), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We need to find P(W|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually not 185 cm or taller (which is 20%, as stated in the question). We also need P(¬A), the probability of the attacker's height being less than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies the attacker's height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 ≈ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3571 or 35.71%.
