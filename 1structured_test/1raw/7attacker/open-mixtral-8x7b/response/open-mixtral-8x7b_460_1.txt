To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (event A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- P(B|A): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
- P(B|not A): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2 (This is the complementary probability of the witness being correct when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4138}.
