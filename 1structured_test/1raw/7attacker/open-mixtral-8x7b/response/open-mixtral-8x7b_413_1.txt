To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We'll also denote P(A|B) as the probability that a person is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, and P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are.

From information (b), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

From information (a), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)
       = 0.12 / 0.205
       â‰ˆ 0.585

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.585}
