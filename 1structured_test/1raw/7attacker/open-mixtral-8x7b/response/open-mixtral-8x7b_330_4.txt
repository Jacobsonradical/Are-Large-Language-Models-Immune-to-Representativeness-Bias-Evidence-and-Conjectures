To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a random person in the city has a height of 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying that a person is not 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(B) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we have the evidence W, and we want to find P(A).

To calculate P(A), we can use the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B)

We know that P(B) = 0.15, so P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.85.

Given the population statistics, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the city with that height, i.e., P(A ∩ B) = P(B).

If the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, then they are necessarily shorter than 185 cm, i.e., P(A ∩ ¬B) = P(A|¬B) * P(¬B).

We are not given information about P(A|¬B), but since the witness is more likely to make an error when the actual height is below 185 cm, we can assume that P(A|¬B) < 0.5. In this case, P(A ∩ ¬B) < 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425, and P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B) < P(B) + 0.425 = 0.15 + 0.425 = 0.575.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
