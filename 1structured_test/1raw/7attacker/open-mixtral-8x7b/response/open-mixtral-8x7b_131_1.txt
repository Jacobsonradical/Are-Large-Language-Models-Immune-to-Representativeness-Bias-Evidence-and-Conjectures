To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness.

The base rate is given as 15% (or 0.15).

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the sensitivity or true positive rate of the witness is 0.8, and the false positive rate is 0.2.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B).

- P(B|A) is the sensitivity of the witness, which is 0.8.
- P(A) is the base rate, which is 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
