To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, which happens 20% of the time, and the actual height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 15% of the population)
P(not A) = 0.85 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.789

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.789.
