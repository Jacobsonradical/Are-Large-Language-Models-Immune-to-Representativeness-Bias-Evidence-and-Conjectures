To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we have:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they actually are)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38% (rounded to two decimal places).
