To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
A - the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the data provided, we know:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (8.5% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where he is shorter than 185 cm:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) and P(A), so we just need to find P(W|not A) and P(not A).
P(not A) is simply 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
For P(W|not A), the witness erroneously identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time:
P(W|not A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Format answer:
{probability: 0.345}
