To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the error rate of the witness:
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Format answer: {probability: 0.4138}
