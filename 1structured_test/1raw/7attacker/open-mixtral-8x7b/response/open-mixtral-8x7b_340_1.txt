To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.50 (witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and half of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem,

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.50 * 0.85 = 0.425

Now, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.425 = 0.120 + 0.425 = 0.545

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.545 â‰ˆ 0.216
