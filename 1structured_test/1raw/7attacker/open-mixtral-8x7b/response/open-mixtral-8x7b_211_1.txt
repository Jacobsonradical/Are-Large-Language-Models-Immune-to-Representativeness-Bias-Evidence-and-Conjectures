To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing new evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller (from the city statistics).
P(B) is the probability that the witness randomly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
P(A|B) is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness.
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem description, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
