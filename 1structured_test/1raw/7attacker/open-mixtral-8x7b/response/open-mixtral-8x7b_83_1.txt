To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define the following terms:

* H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* E: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(E|¬H) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can now calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
= 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]
= 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
