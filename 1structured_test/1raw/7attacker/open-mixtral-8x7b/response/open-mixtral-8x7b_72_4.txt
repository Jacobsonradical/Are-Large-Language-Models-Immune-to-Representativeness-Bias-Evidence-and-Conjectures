To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness's statement and the error rate of the witness.

First, let's denote:

* P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
* P(E): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* P(~E): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(E) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(~E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

We want to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A | E) = P(A ∩ E) / P(E)

We can find P(A ∩ E) using the formula for conditional probability:

P(A ∩ E) = P(E | A) \* P(A)

From the given information, the witness's error rate is independent of the actual height of the attacker, so P(E | A) = P(E) = 0.8.

Therefore, P(A ∩ E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12.

Now, we can find P(A | E):

P(A | E) = P(A ∩ E) / P(E) = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
