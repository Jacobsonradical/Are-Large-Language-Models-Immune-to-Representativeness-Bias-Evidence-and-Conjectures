To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller,
- C as the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller),
- P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')

Now, we need to find P(B|C'), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B|C') = 1 - P(B'|C') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller),

and

P(C') = 1 - P(C) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(C|B):

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
