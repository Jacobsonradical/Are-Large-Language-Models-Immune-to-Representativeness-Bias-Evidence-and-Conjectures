To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (80%) and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%).

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- Event W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can find P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
