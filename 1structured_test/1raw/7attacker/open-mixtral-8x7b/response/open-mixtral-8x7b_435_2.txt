To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the evidence we have (the witness's statement).

From the information given, we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
