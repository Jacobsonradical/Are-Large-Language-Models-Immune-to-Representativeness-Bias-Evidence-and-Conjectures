To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the observed data, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observed data.

According to the problem, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So, our prior probabilities are:
- P(H) = 0.15
- P(H') = 0.85 (the complementary event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and errs with 20% probability. This can be represented as:
- P(D|H) = 0.8 (the probability of observing D given that H is true)
- P(D'|H) = 0.2 (the probability of not observing D given that H is true)
- P(D|H') = 0.2 (the probability of observing D given that H' is true; this is the false positive rate)
- P(D'|H') = 0.8 (the probability of not observing D given that H' is true)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|D):

P(H|D) = (P(D|H) * P(H)) / (P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|H') * P(H'))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
