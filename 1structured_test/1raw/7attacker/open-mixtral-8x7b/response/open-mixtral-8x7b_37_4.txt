To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(Correct | 185+): probability that the witness is correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(Error | <185): probability that the witness errs when the attacker's height is less than 185 cm = 0.2
- P(<185): probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm = 0.85 (from the problem description)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have two possible scenarios for P(B), depending on whether the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller or not:
P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | <185) * P(<185)

We need to compute P(B | <185):
- The witness has a 20% chance of erring, so they will mistakenly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2
- This probability is conditional on the attacker's height being less than 185 cm, so P(B | <185) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(B):
- P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | <185) * P(<185) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17 * 0.85

Now we can compute P(A | B):
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17 * 0.85)

Solving for P(A):
- Let's denote P(A) as p
- 0.8 * p = P(A | B) * (0.8 * p + 0.17 * 0.85)
- 0.8 * p = P(A | B) * 0.8 * p + P(A | B) * 0.17 * 0.85
- 0.8 * p - P(A | B) * 0.8 * p = P(A | B) * 0.17 * 0.85
- p * (0.8 - P(A | B) * 0.8) = P(A | B) * 0.17 * 0.85

We don't have a specific value for P(A | B), but we can express p in terms of P(A | B):
p = (P(A | B) * 0.17 * 0.85) / (0.8 - P(A | B) * 0.8)

The problem asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, so we can use the witness's ability to correctly identify a person of that height as our estimate for P(A | B):

P(A | B) = 0.8

Substituting this value into our equation for p:
p = (0.8 * 0.17 * 0.85) / (0.8 - 0.8 * 0.8) = 0.1632

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1632}
