To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know the following probabilities:

P(A) = 15% (or 0.15)
P(B|A) = 80% (or 0.8)
P(B|¬A) = 20% (or 0.2)

Note that ¬A represents the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

First, we need to calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 100% - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the numerator of Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

We also need to calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
