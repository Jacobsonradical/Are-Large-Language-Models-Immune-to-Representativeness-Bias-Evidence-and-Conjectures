Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we can set up the following equation:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Now, we need to calculate P(B):
- The witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)).
- The witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller (100% - 85% = 15%).
- When the person is not 185 cm or taller, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

So, P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
