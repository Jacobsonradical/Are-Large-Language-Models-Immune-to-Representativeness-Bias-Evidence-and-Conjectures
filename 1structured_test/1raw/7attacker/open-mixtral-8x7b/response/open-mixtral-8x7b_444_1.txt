To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

Using the formula for conditional probability, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (TP) and the false positives (FP) in the witness's judgments.

We have:
P(B) = P(TP) + P(FP)

where:
P(TP) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12
P(FP) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Thus, we get:
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
