To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. We are given this probability as 0.8, or 80%.

Next, let's find P(A). This is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We are given this probability as 0.15, or 15%.

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and when it is not.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). Now we need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is equivalent to the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, which happens 20% of the time: P(B|not A) = 0.2.

We are also given P(not A) = 0.85, or 85%.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345, or 34.5%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
