To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
b) In the city's population, 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the evidence provided by the witness.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find:
P(B|not A) = probability of witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B') = 1 - 0.85 * 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

We also need:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.83 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.1157

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1157 or 11.57%.
