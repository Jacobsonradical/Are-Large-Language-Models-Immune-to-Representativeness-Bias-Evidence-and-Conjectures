To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know that:
P(B | A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B | not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A | B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / [P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to calculate P(B | not A):

If the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm), the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate P(B | not A) as follows:

P(B | not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A | B):

P(A | B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
P(A | B) â‰ˆ 0.3006

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3006}
