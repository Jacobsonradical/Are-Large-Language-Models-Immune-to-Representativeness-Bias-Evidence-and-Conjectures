To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided by the witness and the general population statistics.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

First, we need to calculate each term in the formula:

P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This equals the accuracy of the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the city's statistics, this is 15%.

P(B): Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we need to consider both cases where the person is actually 185 cm or taller and where the person is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A): Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. This equals the error rate of the witness, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(not A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41 (or 41%).
