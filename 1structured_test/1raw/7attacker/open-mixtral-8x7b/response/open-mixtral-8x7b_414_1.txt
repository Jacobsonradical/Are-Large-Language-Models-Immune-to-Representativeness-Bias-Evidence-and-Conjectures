To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

1. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the accuracy of the witness, which is 80% according to the problem statement. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

2. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the city's statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

3. P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

   - P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is the error rate of the witness, which is 20% according to the problem statement.
   
   - P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

   So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.345 approximately.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
