To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population distribution and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller:

P(Correct identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:

P(Incorrect identification | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / (P(Witness identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness identification | Height < 185 cm) * P(Height < 185 cm))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
