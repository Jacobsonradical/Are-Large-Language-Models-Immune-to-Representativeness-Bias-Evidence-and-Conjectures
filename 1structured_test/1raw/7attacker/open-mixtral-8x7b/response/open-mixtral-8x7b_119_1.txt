To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness. We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. We need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the possibility of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller. The complementary probability of the witness correctly identifying the height is P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, where A' represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and B' represents the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(A') = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
