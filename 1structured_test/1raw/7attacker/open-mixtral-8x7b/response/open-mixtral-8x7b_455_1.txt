To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, we know from (a) that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population is 0.15.

However, we also have information from (b) that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony is 0.8.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then,

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We have P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is given as 20%.

Therefore,

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
