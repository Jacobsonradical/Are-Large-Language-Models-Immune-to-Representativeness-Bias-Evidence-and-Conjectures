To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which equals 0.15 according to the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to the given information.
- P(A|B) as the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We know that P(A) = 0.15, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
