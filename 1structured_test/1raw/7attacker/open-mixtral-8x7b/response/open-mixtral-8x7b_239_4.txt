To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller

We know that P(E) = 0.15 (from the population statistics).

Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we have P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, the witness also errs in 20% of the cases, so we have P(B|not A) = 0.2, where not A means the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases (A and not A) and calculate their probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
