To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- ~W as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time). We also know that P(~W|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate it as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

We know P(W|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, so we need to find P(W|~A) and P(~A).

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, P(W|~A) = P(~A) * P(W|~A) / P(~W|~A) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.04 * 0.85 = 0.148

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.148 â‰ˆ 0.804

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.804 (80.4%).
