To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness's identification. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness is more likely to err by saying a person is taller than they are or shorter than they are. To be conservative, let's assume that the witness is equally likely to make either type of error.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

* The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height, which is 0.8.
* The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height, is the probability that the witness identifies a randomly selected person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (because the witness is equally likely to err in either direction).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified them as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified them as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified them as 185 cm or taller)

= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

= 0.5625 / (0.5625 + 0.17)

= 0.767

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.767}.
