To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A).

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

To use this information, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know three of the four terms in Bayes' theorem:

* P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%).
* P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is what we want to find.
* P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not A) = 1 - P(A). To find P(B|not A), we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values we know:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

To find P(A), we need to solve this equation. To simplify it, we can multiply both sides by (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))) to get:

P(A|B) \* (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))) = 0.8 * P(A)

Expanding this equation, we get:

0.8 * P(A|B) \* P(A) + 0.2 * P(A|B) \* (1 - P(A)) = 0.8 \* P(A)

We can simplify this equation further by dividing both sides by 0.8:

P(A|B) \* P(A) + 0.25 \* P(A|B) \* (1 - P(A)) = P(A)

Rearranging the terms, we get:

0.25 \* P(A|B) \* (1 - P(A)) = (1 - P(A|B)) \* P(A)

Now, we can use the fact that P(A|B) = 0.8, so:

0.25 \* 0.8 \* (1 - P(A)) = (1 - 0.8) \* P(A)

Simplifying, we get:

0.2 \* (1 - P(A)) = 0.2 \* P(A)

Dividing both sides by 0.2, we get:

1 - P(A) = P(A)

Therefore, P(A) = 0.5 (50%).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
