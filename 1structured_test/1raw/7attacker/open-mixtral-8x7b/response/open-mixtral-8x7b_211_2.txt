To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify a randomly chosen person from the city as being 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, the probability that the witness would identify a person as being 185 cm or taller is:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify a randomly chosen person from the city as being 185 cm or taller when the person's actual height is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness would identify a person as being 185 cm or taller when the person's actual height is shorter than 185 cm is:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability that a person randomly chosen from the city is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the person as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We already have the values for each of these probabilities:

* P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
* P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
* P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) * P(actual height is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Putting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.4535

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4535}
