To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of a hypothesis (A) given some observed evidence (B). In this case, the hypothesis (A) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the observed evidence (B) is that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

From the information given:
- P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller; this is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller; this is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|not A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller; this is 0.5 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.1 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
- P(not A): Prior probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller; this is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)
= 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.085)
= 0.36 / 0.445

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.81 (81%).
