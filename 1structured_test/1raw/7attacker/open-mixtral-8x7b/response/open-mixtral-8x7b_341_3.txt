Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's calculate P(not A), the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Next, let's calculate P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is a combination of cases where the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct, and cases where the person is not 185 cm or taller but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
