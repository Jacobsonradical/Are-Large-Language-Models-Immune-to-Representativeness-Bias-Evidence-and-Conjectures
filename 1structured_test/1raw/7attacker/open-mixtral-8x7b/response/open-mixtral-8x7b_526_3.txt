To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we can use it to update our initial belief about the attacker's height (before seeing the witness statement) given the new evidence from the witness.

Let A represent the event "attacker's height is 185cm or taller", and E represent the evidence "witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller".

We are asked to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
2. P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185cm or taller)
3. P(E|not A) = 0.5 (witness randomly guesses height when the person is not 185cm or taller, which happens 50% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(E|not A) * P(not A):
P(E|not A) * P(not A) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425

Finally, calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + 0.425)
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.1579

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.1579}
