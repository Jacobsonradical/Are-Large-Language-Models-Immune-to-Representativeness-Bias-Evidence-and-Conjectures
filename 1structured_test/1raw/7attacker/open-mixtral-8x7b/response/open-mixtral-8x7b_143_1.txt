To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, P(A), that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. According to the information given, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to identify a person's height correctly. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, we have P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B'|A') = 0.8, where A' represents a person who is shorter than 185 cm and B' represents the witness incorrectly identifying the person's height.

We also have the following probabilities:
P(B'|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B'|A) \* P(A'))

Substituting the values we have calculated, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) = 0.4137931034482759

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
