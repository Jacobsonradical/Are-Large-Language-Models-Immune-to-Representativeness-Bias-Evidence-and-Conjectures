To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs based on evidence. 

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data:
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

We don't know P(B|not A), but we can calculate it using the witness's error rate. If 20% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, then P(B|not A) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35
= 0.12 / 0.35
= 0.3429 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the observed evidence, is approximately 0.3429.
