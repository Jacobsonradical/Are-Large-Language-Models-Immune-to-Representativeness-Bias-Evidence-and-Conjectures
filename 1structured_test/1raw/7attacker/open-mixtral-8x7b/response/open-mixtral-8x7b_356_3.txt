To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the quantity we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to the given information.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given they actually are, which is 80% or 0.8 according to the given information.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given the witness identifies them as such, which is the same as P(A|B) in this case.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to find P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Rearrange to isolate P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(B) / P(B|A)

Plug in the values:

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15 / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.1875

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1875.
