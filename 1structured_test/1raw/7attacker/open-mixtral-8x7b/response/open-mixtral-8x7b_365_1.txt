To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15)
P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness (80% or 0.8)
P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is shorter than 185 cm is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (20% or 0.2)
P(not A) is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4% when expressed as a percentage).
