To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let event A be "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller". We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed that tall, and erroneously identifies them as such 20% of the time when they are not. This gives us P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B), but we can find P(not B), the probability that the witness does not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, this means that they incorrectly identify someone as not being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually that tall. Similarly, since the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not, this means that they correctly identify someone as not being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is not that tall. Since 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller, we have P(not B) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [P(B)] = [0.12] / [1 - P(not B)] = [0.12] / [1 - 0.68] = 0.381 or 38.1%.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.381}.
