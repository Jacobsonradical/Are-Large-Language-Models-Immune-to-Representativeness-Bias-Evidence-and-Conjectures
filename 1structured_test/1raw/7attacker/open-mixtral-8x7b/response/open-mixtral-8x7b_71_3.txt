To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is stated as:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% probability, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability.

From statement (b), we know that the population distribution in the city is that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the conditional probability P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from statement (a)).

Similarly, we can calculate the conditional probability P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from statement (a) and (b)).

We can calculate the probability P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from statement (b)).

Finally, we can calculate the probability P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.227.

Therefore, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.227 = 0.5717...

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.57 (or 57%).
