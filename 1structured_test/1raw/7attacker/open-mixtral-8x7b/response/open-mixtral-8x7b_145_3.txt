To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(A). Then, we want to calculate P(A) based on the information provided.

First, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can say that P(A) is at least 0.15, since the attacker is at least as tall as 15% of the population.

However, the witness testimony can also affect our estimate of P(A). The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to correctly identify a person's height in such conditions is 80%. We can use this information to update our estimate of P(A) using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as W. Then, we want to calculate P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony.

We can express P(A|W) as:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We know that P(A) is at least 0.15, and P(W|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 80%.

However, we also need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can occur in two ways: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness erroneously identifies them as being 185 cm or taller.

We can express P(W) as:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A).

We know that P(W|A) is 80%, and P(¬A) is 85% (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). However, we don't know the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a person as being 185 cm or taller, which is P(W|¬A).

To estimate this probability, we can use the fact that the witness errs in 20% of the cases. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, we can say that P(¬W|¬A) is 80%, where ¬W is the event that the witness does not identify a person as being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, we can express P(W|¬A) as:

P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We can now calculate P(W) as:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

We can now calculate P(A|W) as:

P(A|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 = 0.34 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.34.
