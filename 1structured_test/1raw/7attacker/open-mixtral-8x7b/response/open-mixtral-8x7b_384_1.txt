To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence.
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B|~A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we are given:
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = x (this is what we want to find)
P(~A) = 1 - x
P(B|A) = 1 (the witness correctly identifies the height 100% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = [1 * x] / [(1 * x) + (0.2 * (1 - x))]

Solving for x:
x = P(A|B)
x = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
x = [1 * P(A|B)] / [1 * P(A|B) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A|B))]

We don't have a specific value for P(A|B), but we can estimate it. If the witness is somewhat reliable and identifies a taller person correctly 80% of the time, then it's reasonable to estimate that the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence is at least 0.8.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
