To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller (from the city statistics).
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (from the witness error rate).
- P(A and B) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller AND the witness identifies them as such.
- P(B and A) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller GIVEN that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the data provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

What we need is P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
