To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 20% or 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

To find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the formula for Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we need to find P(not A). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, that means 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. So, P(not A) = 85% or 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17))] = 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 31.58%.
