To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given the two possible heights of the attacker:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3448

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
