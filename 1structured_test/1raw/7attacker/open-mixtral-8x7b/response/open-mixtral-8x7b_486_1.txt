To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such

From the problem statement, we have:
P(A) = ?
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (witness errs and identifies height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter)
P(A) + P(¬A) = 1

Also, from the problem statement, we know:
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We want to find P(A|B), which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Now we have all the components, so let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * P(A) + 0.15 * 0.85

Now, let's find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.15 * 0.85)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(A). Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we should consider two cases:
1. The witness is correct, so P(A) = 1.
2. The witness is not correct, so P(A) = 0.

Now, let's calculate P(A|B) for both cases:
Case 1: P(A) = 1
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 * 1 + 0.15 * 0.85) ≈ 0.84

Case 2: P(A) = 0
P(A|B) = 0

Since we have no information to favor one case over the other, we will take the average of the two probabilities as our final estimate:
(0.84 + 0) / 2 ≈ 0.42

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.42}
