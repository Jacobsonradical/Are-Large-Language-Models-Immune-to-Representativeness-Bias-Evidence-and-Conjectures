To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we are given the following probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
