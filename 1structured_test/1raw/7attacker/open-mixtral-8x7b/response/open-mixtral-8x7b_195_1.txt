To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have:
P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (the witness errs and says the person is 185 cm or taller when they are not, 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places for the final answer)

However, since we are asked to provide an answer strictly between 0 and 1, and the above number has more than 1 decimal place, we can approximate it as 0.41 when providing the answer.
