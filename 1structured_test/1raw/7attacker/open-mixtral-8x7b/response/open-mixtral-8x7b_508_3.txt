To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A: event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we can compute the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%)
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|¬A): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%)
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%) as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm

Now, we need to compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.345

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
