To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event based on evidence.

First, let's denote:
- A: the event that a person is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (prior probability)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height given that the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying the height given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 85% = 0.85 (1 - P(A))

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
