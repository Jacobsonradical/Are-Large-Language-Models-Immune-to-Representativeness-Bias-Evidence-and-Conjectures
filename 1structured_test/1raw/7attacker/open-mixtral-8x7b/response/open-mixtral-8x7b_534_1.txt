To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and O represent the observed evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(O|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(O|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)

Now we can calculate P(A|O), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence:

P(A|O) = [P(O|A) * P(A)] / [P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|O) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|O) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
