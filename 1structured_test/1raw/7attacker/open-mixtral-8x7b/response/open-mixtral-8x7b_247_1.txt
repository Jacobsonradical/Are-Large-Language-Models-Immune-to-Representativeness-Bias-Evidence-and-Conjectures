To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5333

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5333}
