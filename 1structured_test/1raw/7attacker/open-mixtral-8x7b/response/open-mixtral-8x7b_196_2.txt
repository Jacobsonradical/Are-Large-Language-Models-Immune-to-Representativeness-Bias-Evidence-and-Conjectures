To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population distribution of heights in the city.

Let's use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

In this case, our hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and our evidence (E) is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that a person chosen at random from the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is actually that tall or not. This is given by:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

where P(not H) is the probability that a person chosen at random from the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85, and P(E|not H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

Putting it all together, we get:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.385

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.385}
