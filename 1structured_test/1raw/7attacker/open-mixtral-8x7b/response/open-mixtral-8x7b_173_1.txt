To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

After calculating the above expression, we get:

{probability: 0.4524, or approximately 45.24%}
