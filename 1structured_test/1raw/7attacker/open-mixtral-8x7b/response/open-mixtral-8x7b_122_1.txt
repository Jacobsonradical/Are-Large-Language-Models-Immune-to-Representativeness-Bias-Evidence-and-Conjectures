To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Using the given information, we can calculate:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).
- P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85%).

Now let's calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
