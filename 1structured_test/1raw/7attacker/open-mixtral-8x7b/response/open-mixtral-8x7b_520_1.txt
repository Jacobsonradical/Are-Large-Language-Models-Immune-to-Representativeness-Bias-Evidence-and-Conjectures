To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the two pieces of information, we can define the following terms:

* P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from part b).
* P(B) is the probability that a person identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 (from part a).
* P(~B) is the probability that a person identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness is actually NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (also from part a).
* P(A|~B) is the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller given that they were not identified as such by the witness, which we don't have direct information about. However, we can use the base rate P(A) as an estimate, since the witness's ability to judge height is not perfect.

Using these terms, Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

We don't have P(B|~A), but we can use the fact that P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A), and that P(~B|~A) is estimated as 1-P(B) since the witness's error rate is assumed to be independent of the true height. Therefore:

P(B|~A) = 1 - (1 - P(B)) = P(A) + P(B) - 1

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + ((0.15 + 0.8 - 1) \* 0.85))

Solving for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = 0.2222

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2222 or 22.22%.
