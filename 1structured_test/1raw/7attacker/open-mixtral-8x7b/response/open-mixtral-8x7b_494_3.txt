To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. We can use this as our prior probability.

Next, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(not A) = 0.85.

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the false positive rate of the witness's identification. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have P(not A|B) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.29 (i.e., the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 29% of the the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm).

Therefore, we have P(B|not A) = P(not A|B) \* P(not A) / P(B) = 0.29 \* 0.85 / (0.29 \* 0.85 + 0.8 \* 0.15) = 0.198.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.198 \* 0.85)
= 0.303

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.303}
