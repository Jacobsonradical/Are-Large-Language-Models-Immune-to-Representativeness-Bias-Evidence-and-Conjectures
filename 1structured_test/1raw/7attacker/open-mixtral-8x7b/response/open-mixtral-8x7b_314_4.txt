To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

From statement (b), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)].

We can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, as 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1445.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1445] = 0.5517.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5517}
