To reason through this problem, we need to combine the given information in a meaningful way.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is our prior knowledge about the distribution of heights in the city.

Second, a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions and found that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Given these two pieces of information, we can now calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of people are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W|A). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(W). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
