To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(A) (prior probability) = 15% = 0.15
- P(B|A) (sensitivity) = 80% = 0.8
- P(B|not A) (1 - specificity) = 20% = 0.2

However, we don't have information about P(not A), the proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm in the city. But, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 100 - 85 = 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(not A) = P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.03
= 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15
= 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
