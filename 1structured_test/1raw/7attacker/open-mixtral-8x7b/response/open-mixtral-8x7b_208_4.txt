To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(A) = 0.15)
- P(~A) as the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (from the data, P(~A) = 0.85)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(B|A) = 0.8)
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (from the data, P(B|~A) = 0.2)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in our values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
