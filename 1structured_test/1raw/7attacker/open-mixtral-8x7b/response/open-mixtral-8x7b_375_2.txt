To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the problem, we are given:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 50% = 0.5 (since the witness guesses randomly, and 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate the denominator of the Bayes' theorem expression:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.545 ≈ 0.2165

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 21.65%.
