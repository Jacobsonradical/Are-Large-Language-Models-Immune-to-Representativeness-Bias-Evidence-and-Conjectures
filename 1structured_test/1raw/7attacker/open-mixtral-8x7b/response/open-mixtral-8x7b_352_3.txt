To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): the probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm
- P(H): the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(H'): the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 1
