To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate. We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the accuracy of the witness's identification. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller. This is given by the false positive rate, which is 1 - the true positive rate (0.2 in this case). Therefore, the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.2.

Putting all of this information together, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Plugging in the values we have calculated, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this value, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.1042

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.1042.
