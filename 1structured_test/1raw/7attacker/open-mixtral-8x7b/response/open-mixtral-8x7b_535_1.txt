To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given:
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can happen in two scenarios - when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and when it's not.

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
