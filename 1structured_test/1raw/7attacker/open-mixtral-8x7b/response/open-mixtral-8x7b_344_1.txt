To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that they were identified as such by the witness (event B). 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the data provided, we know:
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%) from point a.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). This is given in point b.

However, we don't directly have information about P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. To get this, we need to consider both cases where the person is actually 185 cm or taller and where they are not. 

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), and we can assume that the witness randomly guesses when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(B|not A) = 0.5 and P(not A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.5)*(0.85) = 0.44 + 0.425 = 0.865

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.865)
â‰ˆ 0.139

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.139 (or 13.9%).
