To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (E).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

From the given information, we have:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider all possible heights of the attacker, not just those that are 185 cm or taller. We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
where ~H represents the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm, and P(~H) is the probability of this event, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

To calculate P(E|~H), we can use the witness's error rate of 0.2. Thus,
P(E|~H) = 1 - P(~E|~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

The answer is therefore:
{probability: 0.345}
