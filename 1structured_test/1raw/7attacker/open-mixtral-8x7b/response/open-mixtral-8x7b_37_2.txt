Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness's ability to judge height.

If the attacker is randomly chosen from the population, then the probability of being 185 cm or taller is 15% (from the information "b").

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are (from the information "a"). So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

However, the witness also errs and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not (from the information "a"). So, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, is 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness Identification)

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness Identification | Not 185 cm or taller) * P(Not 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness Identification)
P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
