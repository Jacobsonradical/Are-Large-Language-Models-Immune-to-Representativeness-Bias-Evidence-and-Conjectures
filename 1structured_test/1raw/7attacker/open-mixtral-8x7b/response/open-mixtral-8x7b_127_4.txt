To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following data:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
