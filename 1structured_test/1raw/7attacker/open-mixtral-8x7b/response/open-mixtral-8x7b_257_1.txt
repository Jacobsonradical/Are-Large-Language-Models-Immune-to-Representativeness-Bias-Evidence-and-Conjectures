To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 15% (given in part a)
P(B|A) = 80% (given in part b)
P(B|not A) = 20% (100% - 80%; given in part b)
P(not A) = 85% (100% - 15%; given in part a)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138, or approximately 41.4%}
