To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let's define event A as "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B as "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we are given:
1. P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
2. P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
3. P(B|¬A) = P(the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2 (here, ¬A represents the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
4. P(¬A) = P(the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate the numerator:
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
