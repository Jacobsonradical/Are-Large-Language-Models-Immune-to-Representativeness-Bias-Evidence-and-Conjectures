To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
= 0.12 / 0.2645
≈ 0.4538

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4538 or 45.38%.
