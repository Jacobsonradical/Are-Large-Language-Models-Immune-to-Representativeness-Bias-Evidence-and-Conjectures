To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- W(T) as the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- W(S) as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- H as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We have the following probabilities:
P(T) = ?
P(S) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness identifies the attacker correctly 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so:
P(W(T) | T) = 0.8

The witness also errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, so:
P(W(T) | S) = 0.2

We want to find P(T | W(T)), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(T | W(T)) = (P(W(T) | T) * P(T)) / (P(W(T) | T) * P(T) + P(W(T) | S) * P(S))

Plugging in the numbers:
P(T | W(T)) = (0.8 * P(T)) / (0.8 * P(T) + 0.2 * 0.85)

However, since we don't know the exact value of P(T), we cannot find a single numerical estimate for P(T | W(T)). This problem would require additional information to solve.

Answer: {probability: cannot be determined with the given information}
