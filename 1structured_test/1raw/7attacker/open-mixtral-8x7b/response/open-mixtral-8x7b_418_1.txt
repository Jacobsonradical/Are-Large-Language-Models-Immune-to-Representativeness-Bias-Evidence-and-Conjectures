To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after obtaining evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:
- P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = P(the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.20 (the witness errs by identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate the numerator:
P(B|A) * P(A)
= (0.80 * 0.15)
= 0.12

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to get P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
