To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's find the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller:
P(185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15

Next, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability of this event happening considering the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller), which is the weighted sum of probabilities of the witness identifying correctly and incorrectly:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter)

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
