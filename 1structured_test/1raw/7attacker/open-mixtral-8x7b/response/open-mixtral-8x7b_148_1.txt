Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, as well as the probability of the witness being incorrect and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(S) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Similarly, we denote P(W|T) as the probability of the witness being correct, and P(W|S) as the probability of the witness being incorrect.

We are given:
P(T) = 0.15
P(S) = 0.85
P(W|T) = 0.8
P(W|S) = 0.2

Now we want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. By Bayes' theorem, we can compute:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)]

We can calculate the values:

P(W|T) * P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(W|S) * P(S) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Hence,
P(T|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
