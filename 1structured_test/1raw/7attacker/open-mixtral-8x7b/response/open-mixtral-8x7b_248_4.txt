To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We know that:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs and mistakenly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

We need to calculate P(A), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since we don't know the exact height of the attacker, we'll make an assumption that the attacker's height is a random variable that follows the distribution of the city's population.

Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can say:
P(A) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17) = 0.09 / 0.26 ≈ 0.346

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.346.
