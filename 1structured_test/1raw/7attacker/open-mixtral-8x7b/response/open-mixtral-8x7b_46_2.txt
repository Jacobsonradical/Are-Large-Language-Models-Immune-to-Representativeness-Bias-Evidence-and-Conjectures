To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (20%, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We can compute the probabilities as follows:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|not A) = 0.2
P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
