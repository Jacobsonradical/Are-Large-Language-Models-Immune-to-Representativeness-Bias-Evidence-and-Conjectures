To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate it as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.4138.
