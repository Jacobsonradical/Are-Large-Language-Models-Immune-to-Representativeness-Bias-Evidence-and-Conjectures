To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Let's denote P(A) as PA, the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 0.15 according to (b).

Let's denote P(B|A) as P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller according to (a).

Let's denote P(B|not A) as P(B|not A) = 0.15, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Let's denote P(not A) as P(not A) = 1 - PA = 0.85, the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the population.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.5556

{probability: 0.5556}
