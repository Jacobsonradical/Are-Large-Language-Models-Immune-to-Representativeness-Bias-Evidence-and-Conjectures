To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, let's find P(W|A):
- Given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as such 80% of the time.
- Therefore, P(W|A) = 0.8

Next, let's find P(A):
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- Therefore, P(A) = 0.15

Now, let's find P(W):
- Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this means that P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
- P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- Using the complement probability, P(W and not A) = 1 - P(W and A) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88
- We need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.
- Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness erroneously identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as follows: P(W and not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
- Therefore, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
