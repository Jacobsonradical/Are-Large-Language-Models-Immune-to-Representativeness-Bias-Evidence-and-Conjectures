To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, i.e., the observation made by the witness.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From the given data, we have:
- P(E|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the probability we want to find.
- P(E|not A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.2 (20%).
- P(not A): The probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller. This is 1 - P(A).
- P(E): The total probability of the observation. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

We can now calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
