To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This gives us the following likelihoods:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us the following prior probabilities:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability P(A) given the witness's statement:

P(A | witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | A) * P(A) / P(witness says 185 cm or taller)

The term P(witness says 185 cm or taller) can be computed as:
P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | A) * P(A) + P(witness says 185 cm or taller | not A) * P(not A)

Plugging in the likelihoods and prior probabilities, we get:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can compute P(A | witness says 185 cm or taller):

P(A | witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
