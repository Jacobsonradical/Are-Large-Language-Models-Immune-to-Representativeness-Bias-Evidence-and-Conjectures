To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm

From the information given:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W|A') = 0.2
2. P(A') = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))

Now we can calculate:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
