To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for both cases: when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and when the person is not, but the witness erroneously identifies them as such:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already have P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85. We don't have a direct number for P(B|not A), but we can infer it based on the information that the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller:
P(not B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2
So, P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%.
