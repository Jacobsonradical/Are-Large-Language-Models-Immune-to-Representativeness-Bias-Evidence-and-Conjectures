To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B, which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can calculate P(B) as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
