To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information and apply conditional probability.

We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from statement a)). However, the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's height also plays a role (from statement b)). The witness is correct 80% of the time, which means there is still a 20% chance that they will make an error.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the witness.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

= [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

The first term in the numerator is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 80% (0.8). The second term is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15).

The denominator requires calculating the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the sum of the probabilities of both the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The first term in the denominator is given as 80% * 15% = 12%.

Now let's calculate the second term in the denominator. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 20% (from statement b)). The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85% (from statement a).

So, the second term is 20% * 85% = 17%.

Now, we can calculate the final probability by combining both terms in the numerator and denominator.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.476

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.476 (47.6%).
