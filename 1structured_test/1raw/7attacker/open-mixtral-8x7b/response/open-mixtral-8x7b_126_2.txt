To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We can use the formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

1) P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this probability is 0.8 (80%).

2) P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information about the city's population, this probability is 0.15 (15%).

3) P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
   a) The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller AND the witness identifies the attacker correctly: P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
   b) The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm AND the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller: P(!A) * P(B|!A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Then, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Format answer: {probability: 0.41}
