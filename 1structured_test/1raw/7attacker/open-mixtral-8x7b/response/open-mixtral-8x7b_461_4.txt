To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the observation that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1275
= 0.2475

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2475
≈ 0.4849

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4849 (or 48.49%).
