To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the prior probability, i.e., the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's identification accuracy:
- Correct identification: P(W|A) = 0.8
- Incorrect identification: P(~W|A) = 0.2

Also, we should consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm:
- Incorrect identification: P(W|~A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, i.e., the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.41}
