Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness (80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is shorter than 185 cm is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness (20%, since the witness errs 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the problem, we know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2. Also, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Solving this equation, we get:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.375}
