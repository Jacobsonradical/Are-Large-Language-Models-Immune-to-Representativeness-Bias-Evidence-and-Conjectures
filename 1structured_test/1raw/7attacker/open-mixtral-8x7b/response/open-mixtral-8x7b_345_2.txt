To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. From the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the actual height P(B|A). The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to account for the cases where the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which happens 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of a random person being shorter is 0.85, and the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, by summing up the probabilities of the two scenarios: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4534

Format answer: {probability: 0.4534}
