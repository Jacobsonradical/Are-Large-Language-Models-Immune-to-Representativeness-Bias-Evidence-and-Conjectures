To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8.

We're looking for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Solving for P(A):

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

0.8 * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.15

Multiplying both sides by 0.15:

0.12 = P(A)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12, provided as a number between 0 and 1}
