To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W|A) as the probability of the witness saying the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|~A) as the probability of the witness saying the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs and says the height is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

P(W|~A) * P(~A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
