To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545 (or 45.45%).
