To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population:
P(A is 185 cm or taller) = 15% (given in the question)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:
P(Witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 80% (given in the question)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | A is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 80%

Similarly, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | A is shorter than 1
