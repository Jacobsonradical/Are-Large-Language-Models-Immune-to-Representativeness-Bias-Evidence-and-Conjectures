To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(~E): probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 1
