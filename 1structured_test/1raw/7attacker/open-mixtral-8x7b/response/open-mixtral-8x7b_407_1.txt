To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate:

P(A|W) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / {(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)}] = 0.375 or 37.5%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 37.5%.
