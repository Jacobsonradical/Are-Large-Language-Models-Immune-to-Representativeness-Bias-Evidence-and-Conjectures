To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have:

P(T|E) = P(E|T) * P(T) / P(E)

where:
- P(T|E) is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (T) given the evidence (E). This is what we want to find.
- P(E|T) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (E) given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (T). This is given as 0.80 in the problem statement.
- P(T) is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (T), independent of the evidence. This can be calculated as the ratio of the number of people who are 185 cm or taller to the total population.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (E), independent of the attacker's height. This can be calculated as the sum of P(E|T) * P(T) and P(E|not T) * P(not T), where P(not T) is the probability of the attacker's height being less than 185 cm and P(E|not T) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.

Using the given values, we can calculate:

P(T) = 0.15
P(E|T) = 0.80

To calculate P(E|not T), we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm:

P(E|not T) = P(not T) * (1 - 0.80) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Then, we can calculate P(E) as the sum of P(E|T) * P(T) and P(E|not T) * P(not T):

P(E) = P(E|T) * P(T) + P(E|not T) * P(not T) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.154 + 0.1445 = 0.2985

Finally, we can calculate P(T|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|E) = P(E|T) * P(T) / P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.2985 = 0.12073888785064698

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12.
