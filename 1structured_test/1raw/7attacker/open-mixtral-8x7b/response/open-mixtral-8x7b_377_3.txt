To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Here's how we can reason and compute the answer:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but their ability to judge a person's height is not perfect.
3. In 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
4. However, in 20% of the cases, the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
5. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the city's population statistics and the witness's accuracy.
6. We can calculate the probability by taking the weighted average of the probability from two perspectives:
   A) The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified them as such (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12).
   B) The attacker is not 185 cm or taller, but the witness incorrectly identified them as such (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).
7. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
