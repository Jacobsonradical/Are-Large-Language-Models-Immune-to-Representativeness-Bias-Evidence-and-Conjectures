To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(not A), the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, as:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
