To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness identification (B).

Bayes' theorem states P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (or 80%).
- P(A): The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is what we want to find.
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Using the law of total probability, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

From the information given, we know that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (or 20%), P(not A) = 0.85 (or 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), and therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * P(A)] / {[0.8 * P(A)] + (0.2 * 0.85)}

Since we are only interested in the probability, we can leave the equation in this form. Solving for P(A) would require more specific information about the distribution of heights in the population or additional constraints.

So, the answer is:
{probability: [0.8 * P(A)] / {[0.8 * P(A)] + (0.2 * 0.85)}}
