To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (from data point b), and the likelihood of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (from data point a).

Prior probability:
- P(Tall) = 15% = 0.15

Likelihoods:
- P(Witness identifies Tall | Attacker is Tall) = 80% = 0.8
- P(Witness identifies Tall | Attacker is Not Tall) = 20% = 0.2

Posterior probability (P(Tall | Witness identifies Tall)):

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Witness identifies Tall) = P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness identifies Tall)

We can calculate P(Witness identifies Tall) using the law of total probability:

P(Witness identifies Tall) = P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness identifies Tall | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

Substituting the values:

P(Witness identifies Tall) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Tall | Witness identifies Tall) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.345.
