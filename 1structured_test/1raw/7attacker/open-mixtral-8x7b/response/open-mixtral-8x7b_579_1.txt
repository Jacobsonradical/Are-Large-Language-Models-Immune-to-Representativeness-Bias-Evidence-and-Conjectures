To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now, calculate the numerator:
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645 ≈ 0.4538

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4538 or 45.38%.
