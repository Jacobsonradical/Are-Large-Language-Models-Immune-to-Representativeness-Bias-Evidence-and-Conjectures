To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time). We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

First, let's calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
