To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We are given P(A) = 0.15 and P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height when the person is 185 cm or taller) and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying the height when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, let's calculate P(¬A), the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm. Since P(A) = 0.15, then P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, let's calculate P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as the sum of two cases: when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
