To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (A) and the observation that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.324

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.324}
