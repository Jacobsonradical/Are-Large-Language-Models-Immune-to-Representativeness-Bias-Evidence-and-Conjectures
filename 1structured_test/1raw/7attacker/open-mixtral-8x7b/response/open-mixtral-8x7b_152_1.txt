To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time),
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness errs and identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17 ≈ 0.2945

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.2945 ≈ 0.3392

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3392.
