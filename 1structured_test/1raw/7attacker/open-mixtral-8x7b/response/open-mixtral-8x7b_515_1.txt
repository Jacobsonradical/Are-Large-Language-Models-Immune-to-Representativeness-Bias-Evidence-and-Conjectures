To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8 (from the problem statement).

Now we need to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)

First, we need to calculate the inverse probability P(B|A):
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

Rearrange to find P(A):
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)
P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15))
P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.06)
P(A) = 0.15 / 0.21
P(A) = 0.714285714

Answer: {probability: 0.714285714, or approximately 71.43%}
