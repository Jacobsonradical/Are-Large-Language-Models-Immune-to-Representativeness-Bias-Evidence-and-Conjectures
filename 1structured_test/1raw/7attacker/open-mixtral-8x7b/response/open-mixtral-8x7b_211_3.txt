To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is identified as such by the witness.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a person who is shorter than 185 cm is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
