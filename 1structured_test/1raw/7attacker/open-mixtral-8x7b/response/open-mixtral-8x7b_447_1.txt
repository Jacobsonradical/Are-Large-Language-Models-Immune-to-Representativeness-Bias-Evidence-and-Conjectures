To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
1. P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8
2. P(A): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given P(B|A) and we need to find P(B|~A) where ~A represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can find P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.8)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.8)
= 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
