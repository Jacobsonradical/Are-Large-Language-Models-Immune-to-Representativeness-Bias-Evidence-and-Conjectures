To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the question, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.5 (the witness mistakenly identifies the height 50% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller, since in this city, 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.1563

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1563 or 15.63%.
