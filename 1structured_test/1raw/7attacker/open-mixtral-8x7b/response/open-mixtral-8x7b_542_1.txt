To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population percentages.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that the witness will identify a person as 185 cm or taller
P(C) as the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller in the city's population
