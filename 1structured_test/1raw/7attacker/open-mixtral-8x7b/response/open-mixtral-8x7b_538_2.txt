To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% according to the given data.

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find this, we need to consider both cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote B' as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm". The probability of this event is P(B'|A'), where A' is the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm".

From the information provided, we know:
- P(B'|A'): The probability that the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Now, we can find P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A')

Since P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 85%, we can substitute these values into the equation and compute P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
