To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually less than 185 cm
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height was less than 185 cm

According to the given information, P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 0.85.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(W) * P(A|W) / P(W)
= (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))
= (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85) * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

We can simplify this expression:
0.8 * P(A)^2 - 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17 * P(A) = 0

Now, let's solve for P(A):
0.8 * P(A)^2 + 0.17 * P(A) - 0.17 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula:
P(A) = (-0.17 ± sqrt(0.17^2 - 4 * 0.8 * -0.17)) / (2 * 0.8)

The positive solution is:
P(A) ≈ 0.53

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.53}
