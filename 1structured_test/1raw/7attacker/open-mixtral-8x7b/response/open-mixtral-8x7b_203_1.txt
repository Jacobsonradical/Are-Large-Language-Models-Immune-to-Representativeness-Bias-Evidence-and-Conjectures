To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|Â¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 1
