To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller),
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- P(B) can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A),

Now, we need to find P(B|not A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we have all the values to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
