To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and individual probabilities.

Let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

According to the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15*0.2 + 0.85*0.8 = 0.675 (the witness erroneously identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then we calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.675 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.57375
= 0.69375

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.69375
â‰ˆ 0.16985

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.16985 or 16.99% (when expressed as a percentage).
