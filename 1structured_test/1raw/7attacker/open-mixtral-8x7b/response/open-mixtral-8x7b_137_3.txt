To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's judgement.

First, let's denote:

P(A) = probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) = probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A') = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller

We are given that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'))

Since P(A') = 1 - P(A), we have P(A') = 0.85.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

P(A|B) = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
