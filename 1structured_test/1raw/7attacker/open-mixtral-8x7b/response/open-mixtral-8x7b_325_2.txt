To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- W_cor: Event that the witness correctly identifies that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- W_err: Event that the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

From the information given, we have:
P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W_cor) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W_err) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to estimate P(T|W_cor), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W_cor) = P(W_cor|T) * P(T) / P(W_cor)

First, let's find P(W_cor|T):
Given that the true height of the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify it 80% of the time, so P(W_cor|T) = 0.8

Now, let's find P(W_cor):
P(W_cor) = P(W_cor|T) * P(T) + P(W_cor|S) * P(S)

To find P(W_cor|S), since the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(W_cor|S) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So,
P(W_cor) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.145 = 0.265

Now, we can find P(T|W_cor):
P(T|W_cor) = P(W_cor|T) * P(T) / P(W_cor) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.265 â‰ˆ 0.4527

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4527}
