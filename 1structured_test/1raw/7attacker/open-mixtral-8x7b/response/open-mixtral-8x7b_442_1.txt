To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller

We know that P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

From the problem statement, we have the following likelihood values:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B'|A') = 0.8 (the witness fails to identify the height as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

We want to compute P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to compute P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
