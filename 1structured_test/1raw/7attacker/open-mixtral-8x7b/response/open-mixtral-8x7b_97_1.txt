To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem which links the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that a witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A): The probability that a witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 20% or 0.2 (this is calculated as 1 - P(B|A) for the other half of the population that is shorter than 185 cm).

What we want to find is P(A|B), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such. To calculate this, we need to find P(B), the overall probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
