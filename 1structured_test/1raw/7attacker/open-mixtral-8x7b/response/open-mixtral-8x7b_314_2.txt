To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population has a height not 185 cm or taller)

Now we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
