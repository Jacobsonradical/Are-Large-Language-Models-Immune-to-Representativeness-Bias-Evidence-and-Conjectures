To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = x
P(¬A) = 1 - x
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
