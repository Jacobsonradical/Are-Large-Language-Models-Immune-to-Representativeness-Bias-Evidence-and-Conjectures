To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H) given the observation (O), where the observation is that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|O) = P(O|H) * P(H) / P(O)

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(O|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(O), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We are given P(O|H) for the first case, and we can calculate P(O|~H) (the probability of the observation given the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller) using the witness's error rate:
P(O|~H) = 1 - P(~O|~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We are also given the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (P(H)) and shorter than 185 cm (P(~H)):
P(H) = 0.15, P(~H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(O), the total probability of the observation:
P(O) = P(O|H) * P(H) + P(O|~H) * P(~H)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(H|O), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the observation:
P(H|O) = P(O|H) * P(H) / P(O)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
