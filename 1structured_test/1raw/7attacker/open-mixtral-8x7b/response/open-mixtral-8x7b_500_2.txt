To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find out the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A): Probability of a witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80% chance of being correct).
- P(A): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability we want to find out.
- P(B): Probability of a witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A').

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|A') = 0.2 (20% chance of being incorrect) and P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let's say we assume an initial probability P(A) = 0.5 (50% chance).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.5)) = 0.6

Now we can find the posterior probability:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.667

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
