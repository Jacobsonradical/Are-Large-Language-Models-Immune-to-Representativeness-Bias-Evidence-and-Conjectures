To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics to calculate a conditional probability.

Let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
* C: The witness's identification is correct.
* D: The witness's identification is incorrect.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time), and P(A) can be calculated from the population statistics as P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be written as:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is given as the witness's error rate of 20%.

Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Using this information, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
