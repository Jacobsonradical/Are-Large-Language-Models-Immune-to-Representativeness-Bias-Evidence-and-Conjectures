To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(not A) is the probability that a person in the city is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
