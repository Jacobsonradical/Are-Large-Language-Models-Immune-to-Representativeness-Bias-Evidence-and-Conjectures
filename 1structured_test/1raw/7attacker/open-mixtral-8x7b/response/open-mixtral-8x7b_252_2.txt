To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Next, we are told that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness identification)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(185 cm) = 0.15 (15%)
* P(witness identification | 185 cm) = 0.8 (80%)
* P(witness identification | not 185 cm) = 0.2 (20%)

We need to calculate P(witness identification):

P(witness identification) = P(witness identification and 185 cm) + P(witness identification and not 185 cm)
= P(witness identification | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) + P(witness identification | not 185 cm) \* P(not 185 cm)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(185 cm | witness identification):

P(185 cm | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness identification)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
