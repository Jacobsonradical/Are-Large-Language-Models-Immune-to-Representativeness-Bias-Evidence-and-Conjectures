To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We know the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- P(A): 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|not A): The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- P(not A): 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

Since we are asked for the answer strictly in the format {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, I will provide the answer as:

{probability: 0.41}
