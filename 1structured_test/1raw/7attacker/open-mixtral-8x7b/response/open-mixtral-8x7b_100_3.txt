To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

P(A) = probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(B|A) = probability the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(!A) = probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(B|!A) = probability the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

Now, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)]

We can compute:

P(B|!A) * P(!A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

And then:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255

Finally, we can compute the probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.467

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.467}
