To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was indeed 185 cm or taller)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3. To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases:
   a. The attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
   b. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating the above expression, we get:
{probability: 0.5556, or approximately 56%}
