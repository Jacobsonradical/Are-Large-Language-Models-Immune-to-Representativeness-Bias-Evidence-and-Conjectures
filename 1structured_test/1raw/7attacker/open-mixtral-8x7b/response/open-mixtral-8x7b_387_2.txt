To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 0.85 probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. However, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which happens with a 0.20 error rate.

To calculate the probability of the witness being correct, we can use the formula:

P(Correct) = P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(Correct) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says 185 cm) * P(Witness says 185 cm) / P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know:
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15
- P(Witness says 185 cm) = P(Correct) + P(Error) = 0.80 + 0.20 = 1
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says 185 cm) = P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness says 185 cm)
  = 1 * 0.15 / 1
  = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(Correct):

P(Correct) = 0.15 * 1 / 0.15 = 1

The probability of the witness being correct is 1, which means the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller with a probability of 100%.

Answer: {probability: 1}
