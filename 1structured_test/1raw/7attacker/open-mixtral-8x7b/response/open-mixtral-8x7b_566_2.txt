To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the base rate, which is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 15% of the population falls into this category. Now, let's apply the witness's ability to judge a person's height. In 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller, while in 20% of the cases, the witness erroneously identifies people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(not A) = 0.85. To find P(B|not A), we use the witness's error rate: P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
