To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.3143

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3143 or 31.43%.
