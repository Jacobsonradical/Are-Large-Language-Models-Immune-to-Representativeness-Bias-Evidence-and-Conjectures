To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the question, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(!A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|!A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the true height is less than 185 cm)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and !A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
