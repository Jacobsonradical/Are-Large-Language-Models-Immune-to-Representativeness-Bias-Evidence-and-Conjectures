To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we are interested in finding the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (Hypothesis H) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (Evidence E).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

From the question, we are given:
P(H) = P(taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(E|H) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (20% of the time, but this is for the half of the population that is shorter than 185 cm, so the proportion for the whole population is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1)

We need to find P(E), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H)
= P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205
