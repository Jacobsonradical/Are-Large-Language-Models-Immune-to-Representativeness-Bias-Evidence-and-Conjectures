To reason through this problem, let's break down the given information.

1. 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a reliability of 80% (correctly identifies height 80% of the time).

Now, let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A), so let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

where:
- P(W|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

We're trying to find P(A), and we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's 80% reliability). We also know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population).

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(W|A) * P(A), so let's calculate P(W|not A) * P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(W|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
