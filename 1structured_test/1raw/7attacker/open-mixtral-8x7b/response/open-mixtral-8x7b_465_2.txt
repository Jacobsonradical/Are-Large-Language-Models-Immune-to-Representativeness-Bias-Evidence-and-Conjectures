To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

From statement (a), we know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller.

From statement (b), the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. We can use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the required probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the case where it is not. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness has an 80% success rate when the person is 185 cm or taller and a 20% success rate otherwise (due to errors), we can calculate P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since 20% of the time, the witness will incorrectly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Finally, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 ≈ 0.18 / 0.41 ≈ 0.44

{probability: 0.44}
