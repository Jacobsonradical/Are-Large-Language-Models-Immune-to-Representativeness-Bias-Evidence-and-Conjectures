To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Given that the population is split evenly between people under and at or above 185 cm, we can think of the witness's accuracy as a "weighted flip of a coin."

Let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller:
- Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are: 80% or 0.8
- Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not: 20% or 0.2

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Now, we can combine these probabilities to estimate the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.29}
