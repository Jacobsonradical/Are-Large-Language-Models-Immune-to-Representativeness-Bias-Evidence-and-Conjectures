To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability of 0.15 for the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the prior probability as P(A), the probability of being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement as P(W|A), and the probability of the witness's statement as P(W).

We want to find the posterior probability P(A|W), which is the probability of being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness's statement is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," we can calculate P(W|not A) using the complementary probability:

P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W|A)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(W|A)) * (1 - P(A))

Substituting the values from the problem:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.21
P(W) = 0.33

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.33
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
