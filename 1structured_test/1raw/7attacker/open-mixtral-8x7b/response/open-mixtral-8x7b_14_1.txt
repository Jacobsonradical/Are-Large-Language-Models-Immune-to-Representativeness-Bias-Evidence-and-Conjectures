To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's report
P(E) = Probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

However, we don't have the prior probability P(B), which is the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we need to consider both the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of the witness's judgment.

TPR = P(E|A) = 0.8
FPR = P(E|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time)

Now, we need to determine the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the actual attacker's height is lower than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(E|not A) = FPR = 0.2 = P(not A) * probability of witness reporting 185 cm or taller + P(A) * probability of witness reporting 185 cm or taller

0.2 = 0.85 * (1 - P(E|not A)) + 0.15 * P(E|not A)

Solving for P(E|not A), we get P(E|not A) ≈ 0.1765.

So, P(B) = P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1765 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2073

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2073 ≈ 0.5789

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5789 or 57.89%.
