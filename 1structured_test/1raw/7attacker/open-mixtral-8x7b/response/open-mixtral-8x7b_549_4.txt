To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W_correct): probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller
- P(W_incorrect): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller
- P(T|A): probability of the witness observing the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(T|not A): probability of the witness observing the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm

From the given information:
1) P(W_correct) = 0.8, P(W_incorrect) = 0.2
2) P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3) P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|T), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|T) = P(T|A) * P(A) / (P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|not A) * P(not A))

To calculate P(T|A), the probability that the witness observes the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, we use the witness's ability to correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller:

P(T|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height)

To calculate P(T|not A), the probability that the witness observes the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we use the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller:

P(T|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

Now we can compute P(A|T):

P(A|T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
