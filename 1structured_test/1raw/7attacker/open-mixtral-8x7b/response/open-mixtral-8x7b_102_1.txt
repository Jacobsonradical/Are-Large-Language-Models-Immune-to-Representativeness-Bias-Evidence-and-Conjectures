To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

From the given information, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(W|A') = 0.2
P(A') = 0.85 (15% are 185 cm or taller, so 85% are shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
