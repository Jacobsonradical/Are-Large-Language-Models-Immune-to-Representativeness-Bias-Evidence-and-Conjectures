To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2*0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values into the formula:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.3158 or 31.58%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3158 or 31.58%.
