To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population. We will apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
- P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
- P(A|B) ≈ 0.44

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.44}
