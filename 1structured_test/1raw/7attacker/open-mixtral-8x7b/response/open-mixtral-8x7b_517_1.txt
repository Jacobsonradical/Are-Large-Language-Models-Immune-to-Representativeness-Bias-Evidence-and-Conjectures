To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the quantity we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 for the witness.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the city's population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can rearrange the equation to solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(B|A)

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(A) = (P(A|B) * P(B)) / P(B|A)
P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8

P(A) = 0.15 / 0.8
P(A) = 0.1875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1875}
