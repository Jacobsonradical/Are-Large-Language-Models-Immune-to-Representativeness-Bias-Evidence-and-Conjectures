To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, calculate P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. We are given this probability as 80% or 0.8.

Next, calculate P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now calculate P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for each height category: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

P(B|A') is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is known to err 20% of the time, P(B|A') is 0.2.

P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
