To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the prior probability, P(A), that a person is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. When the person is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them as such with 80% probability. So, the probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller if they actually are, P(B|A), is 0.8.

However, when the person is not 185 cm or taller, the witness incorrectly identifies them as such with 20% probability. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller if they are not, P(B|not A), is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|B), that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We already have the values for P(B|A), P(A), P(B|not A), and the city's population being 85% shorter than 185 cm, which can be written as P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.427

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.427}
