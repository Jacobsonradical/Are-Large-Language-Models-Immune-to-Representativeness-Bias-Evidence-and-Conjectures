To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.15 (15% of the population)

P(B|A) = P(the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = P(the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.20 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353 (the witness errs 20% of the time among people who are not 185 cm or taller, and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.2353 * 0.85)
≈ 0.2927

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2927 or 29.27%.
