To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the population statistics and the accuracy of the witness's identification. We'll use the law of total probability to combine these two pieces of information.

Let's denote P(Tall) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is the base rate P(Tall) = 0.15.

However, the witness reported that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is not perfect. The witness correctly identified tall people 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using these numbers, we can calculate the probability that the witness would report the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually tall:

P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is tall) = 0.8

We also need to calculate the probability that the witness would report the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually not tall:

P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is not tall) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report, using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness reports tall) = P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) / P(Witness reports tall)

The probability of the witness reporting tall, P(Witness reports tall), can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(Witness reports tall) = P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is not tall) * P(Attacker is not tall)

= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

= 0.12 + 0.17

= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness reports tall) = P(Witness reports tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) / P(Witness reports tall)

= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

= 0.321

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.321.
