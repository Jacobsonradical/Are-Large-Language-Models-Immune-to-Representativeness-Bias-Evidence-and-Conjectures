To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8
- P(W|¬A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2
- P(A'): Probability that the attacker's height was NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A): Probability of the complementary event of A, which is 1 - P(A)
- P(A'|¬W): Probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm given the witness identified the height as shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
