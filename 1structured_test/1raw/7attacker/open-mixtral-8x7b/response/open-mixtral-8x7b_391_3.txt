To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller, i.e., the witness errs)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm in the city)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
