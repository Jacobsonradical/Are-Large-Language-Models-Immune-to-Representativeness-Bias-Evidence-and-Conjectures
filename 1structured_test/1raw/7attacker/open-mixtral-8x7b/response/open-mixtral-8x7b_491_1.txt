To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931 (rounded to 8 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4137931}
