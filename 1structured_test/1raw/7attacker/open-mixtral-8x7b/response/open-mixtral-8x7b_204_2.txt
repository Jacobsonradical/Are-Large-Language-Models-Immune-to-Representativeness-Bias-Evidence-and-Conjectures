To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population.

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(C) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both true positives (TP) and false positives (FP):
P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A')
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * P(A'))

However, we don't have P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Without making additional assumptions, we cannot calculate the exact probability.

If we assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be shorter or taller than 185 cm, then P(A) = P(A') = 0.5, and:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Then, we can estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.667

So, under this assumption, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
