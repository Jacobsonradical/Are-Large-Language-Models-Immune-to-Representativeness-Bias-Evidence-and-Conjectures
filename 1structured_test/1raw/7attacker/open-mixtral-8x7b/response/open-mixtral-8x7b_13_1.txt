To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's assessment under similar conditions. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Given the witness's ability to judge, if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify this 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

This is equal to:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
