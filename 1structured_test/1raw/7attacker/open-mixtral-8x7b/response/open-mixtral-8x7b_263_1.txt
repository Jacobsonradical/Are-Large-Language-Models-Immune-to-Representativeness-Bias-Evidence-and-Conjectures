To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We want to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

First, we need to find P(not A), which is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. We are given this as 20%, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.41}
