To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in this city, based on the information given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller), given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, which we denote as P(E|A). According to the problem, the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time:
P(E|A) = 80% = 0.8

However, we also need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which we denote as P(E|B). In this case, the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time:
P(E|B) = 20% = 0.2

Finally, we need to calculate the total probability of the evidence, P(E), which is the sum of the likelihoods of the evidence for both possible heights. This is given by:
P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|B) * P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|E), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
