To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller,
- S as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(W|E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(S|not E) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not E) = 0.15 (population distribution, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller)
P(E) = 1 - P(not E) = 0.85 (population distribution, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(E|W) = (P(W|E) * P(E)) / (P(W|E) * P(E) + P(S|not E) * P(not E))

First, compute the denominator:
P(W|E) * P(E) + P(S|not E) * P(not E) = (0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15) = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

Now, find the numerator:
P(W|E) * P(E) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Finally, compute P(E|W):
P(E|W) = 0.68 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.9577

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.9577 or 95.77%.
