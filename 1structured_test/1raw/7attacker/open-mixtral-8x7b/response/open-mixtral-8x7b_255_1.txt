To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%.

Next, let's take into account the witness's ability to identify a person's height correctly. The witness is correct 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Therefore, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(A|W), we can use the formula:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

First, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% base rate) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).

Next, we need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. Similarly, P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Plugging these values in, we get:

P(W) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
