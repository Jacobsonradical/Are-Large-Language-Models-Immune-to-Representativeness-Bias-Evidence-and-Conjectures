To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

According to Bayes' theorem,

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.0255

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.0255] = 0.9216 or approximately 0.9216 (92.16%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.9216 or approximately 92.16%.
