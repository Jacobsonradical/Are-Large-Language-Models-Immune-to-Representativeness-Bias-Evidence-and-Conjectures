To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics (a) and the witness's accuracy (b).

First, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time.

To calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where:

* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (which we know is 0.8)
* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we calculated as 0.15)
* P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller
* P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85)

To calculate P(B|not A), we can use the witness's error rate of 20%. This means that if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there is still a 20% chance that the witness will identify them as such.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
