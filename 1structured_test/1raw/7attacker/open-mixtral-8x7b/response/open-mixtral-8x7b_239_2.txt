To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. When given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that the witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller has a likelihood of 0.8 if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, and a likelihood of 0.2 if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. In the city where the attack occurred, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To estimate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the likelihood that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller)

We also know that P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where not A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, so we need to calculate P(B|not A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is known to err 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Putting it all together:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.72

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.72.
