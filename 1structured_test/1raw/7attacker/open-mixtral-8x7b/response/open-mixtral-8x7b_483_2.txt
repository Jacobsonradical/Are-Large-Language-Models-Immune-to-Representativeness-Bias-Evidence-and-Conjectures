To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. This theorem states that the probability of an event is equal to the sum of the probabilities of that event occurring under each mutually exclusive condition.

In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and there are two mutually exclusive conditions: the witness is correct and the witness is not correct.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness is correct, is 0.8 (from the information provided).

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness is not correct, is 0.15 (from the information that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

The probability that the witness is correct is 0.8 (from the information provided).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness is correct) \* P(witness is correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness is not correct) \* P(witness is not correct)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.8 + 0.15 \* 0.2

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.64 + 0.03

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.67

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.67.
