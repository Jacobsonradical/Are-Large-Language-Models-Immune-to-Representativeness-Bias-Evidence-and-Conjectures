To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Calculate P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A)' = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
= 0.12 / 0.72
≈ 0.1667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1667 or 16.67%.
