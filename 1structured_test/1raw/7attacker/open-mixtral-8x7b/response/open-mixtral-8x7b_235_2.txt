To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller given the witness identifies them as such, which is the sensitivity or true positive rate of the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(¬B) = Probability of a random person in the city being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(¬B|¬A) = Probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm given the witness identifies them as such, which is the specificity or true negative rate of the witness, which is 1 - 0.2 or 0.8.

Now let's calculate the probability:

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(¬B) * P(¬B|¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.85 * 0.8)]
= 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 12%.
