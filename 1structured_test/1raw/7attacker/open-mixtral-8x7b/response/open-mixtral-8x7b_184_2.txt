To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

According to statement (a), the witness correctly identified people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, can be calculated as:

P(A|W) = 0.8

where W represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

where P(W|A) is the probability of observing W given that A is true, and P(W) is the probability of observing W.

We know that P(W|A) = 1, because if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, then the witness will always identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We also know that P(A) = 0.15, because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)

where P(not A) = 0.85, and P(W|not A) can be calculated as follows:

P(W|not A) = P(not A|W) \* P(W) / P(not A)

where P(not A|W) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Since the witness is only correct 80% of the time, it means that 20% of the time, the witness will identify someone as being 185 cm or taller even if they are not:

P(not A|W) = 0.2

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(W|not A) = (0.2 \* 0.5) / 0.85 = 0.1176

Therefore, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (1 \* 0.15) + (0.1176 \* 0.85) = 0.2344

Finally, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W) = 0.15 / 0.2344 = 0.6403

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6403 or 64.03%.
