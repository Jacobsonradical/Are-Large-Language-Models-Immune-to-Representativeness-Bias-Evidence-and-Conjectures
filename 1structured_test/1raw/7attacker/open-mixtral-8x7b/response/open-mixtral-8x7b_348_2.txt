To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm (A).
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (B).

We want to find the probability of scenario A being true. Since we only have information about the witness's ability to identify the height of a person and not about their ability to correctly identify the attacker as the actual culprit, we can use the witness's statistics to estimate the probability.

The witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of scenario A is:

P(A) = 0.8

Please note that this is an estimation based on the given information, and there might be other factors influencing the actual probability, such as the witness's familiarity with people of different heights.

{probability: 0.8}
