To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (from b)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
