To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given they are actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|A) = Probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such, which is also 80% or 0.8.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We need to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / 0.15

Now, we need to find the value of P(A) that makes the equation true. We can do this by dividing both sides by 0.8:

P(A) = P(A) / 0.8 * (1/0.15)

Now, multiply both sides by 0.8 and divide by 1.2 to solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(A) / 1.2
P(A) = 0.8 / 1.2
P(A) = 2/3

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 2/3}
