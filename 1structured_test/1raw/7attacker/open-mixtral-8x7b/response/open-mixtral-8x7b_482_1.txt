To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, P(A), where A is the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.

Next, we have information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. The witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that the sensitivity (true positive rate) of the witness is 0.8, and the false positive rate is 0.2.

Using this information, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where P(not A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85) and P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identified a person as being 185 cm or taller when they were actually shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.2, the false positive rate).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
