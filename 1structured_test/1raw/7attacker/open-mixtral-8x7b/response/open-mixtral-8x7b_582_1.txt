To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We know from part (a) of the question that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy.

Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability of A given B, or P(A|B).

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B).

P(B|A) is given as 80%, or 0.8.

P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% in part (b) of the question, or 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and the witness is incorrect in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The probability that the witness is incorrect in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

To find P(B), we add these two probabilities together:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
