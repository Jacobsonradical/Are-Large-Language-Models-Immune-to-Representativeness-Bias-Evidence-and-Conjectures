To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.

P(B) = Probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

P(A|B) = Probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is the same as P(A|B), 0.8.

P(~B|A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

P(~B) = Probability of a random person in the city being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(A|~B) = Probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the error rate, 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to solve for P(A), so let's rearrange to:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Now we can calculate P(A) using the probabilities we found earlier:

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.8 / (0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15)
P(A) = 0.92

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.92}
