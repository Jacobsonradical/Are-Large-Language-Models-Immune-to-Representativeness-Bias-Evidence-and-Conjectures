To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, meaning there's an 80% chance of being correct and a 20% chance of being incorrect.
2. The population distribution states that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

To use Bayes' theorem, we need to compute the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we compute the denominator:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we compute the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
