To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy (P(B|A) = 0.8) and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

From statement b, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (P(A)) and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (P(not A)).

To find P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting in the values from statements a and b:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
