To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We are given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is as follows:
- Correct identification rate: 80% (for people who are 185 cm or taller)
- Error rate: 20% (for people who are 185 cm or taller)

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability of this being a correct identification. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in the city's population, so P(A) = 0.15.
Let P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can find it as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), but we don't know P(B). To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, so we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

The witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so the error rate for people who are shorter than 185 cm is also 20%. Hence, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
