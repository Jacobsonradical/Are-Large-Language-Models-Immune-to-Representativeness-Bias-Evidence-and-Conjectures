To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: A witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, which is 100% - 80% = 20%)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.15 * (1 - 0.15))
= 0.12 + 0.15 * 0.85
≈ 0.2375

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.2375
≈ 0.5059

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5059}
