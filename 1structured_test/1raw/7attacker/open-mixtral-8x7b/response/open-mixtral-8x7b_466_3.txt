To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): Probability that a witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B), the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. To find this value, we need to consider both cases where the person is 185 cm or taller and where the person is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + P(B|not A) * 0.85

Here, P(B|not A) is the probability that a witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
