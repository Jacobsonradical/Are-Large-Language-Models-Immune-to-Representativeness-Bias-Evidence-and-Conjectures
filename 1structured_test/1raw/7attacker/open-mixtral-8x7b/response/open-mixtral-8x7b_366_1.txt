To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population. 

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A), given the two pieces of information.

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, we can write:

P(Correctly Identified | A) = 0.8
P(Incorrectly Identified | Not A) = 0.2

From the second piece of information, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, we can write:

P(A) = 0.15
P(Not A) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A | Correctly Identified) as follows:

P(A | Correctly Identified) = P(Correctly Identified | A) \* P(A) / [P(Correctly Identified | A) \* P(A) + P(Incorrectly Identified | Not A) \* P(Not A)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A | Correctly Identified) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Solving for P(A | Correctly Identified), we get:

P(A | Correctly Identified) = 0.36

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
