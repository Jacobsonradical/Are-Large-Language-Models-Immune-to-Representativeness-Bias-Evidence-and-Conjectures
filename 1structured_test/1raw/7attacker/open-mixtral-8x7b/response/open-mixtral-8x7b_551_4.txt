To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

To calculate P(not A), it is the complement of P(A) so P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
