To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller (given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller).
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller (given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller).

We are given:
- P(A|W) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(¬A|W) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬B) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find: P(A) = ?

Applying Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|¬A)*P(¬A))

We need to find P(W|A) and P(W|¬A). We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time. So,

P(W|A) = P(Correctly identifying 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(W|¬A) = P(Incorrectly identifying 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Correctly identifying shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can compute P(A):

P(A) = P(A|W) * (P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|¬A)*P(¬A)) / P(W|A)
= 0.8 * (0.8*P(A) + 0.15*0.15) / 0.8
= 0.8 * (0.8*P(A) + 0.0225) / 0.8

Now, we solve for P(A):

0.8 * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) * 0.8 + 0.018
0.16 * P(A) = 0.018
P(A) = 0.018 / 0.16
P(A) = 0.1125

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1125}
