To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm; the probability of the person being shorter than 185 cm is 85%)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.2353 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
