To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Format answer: {probability: 0.345}
