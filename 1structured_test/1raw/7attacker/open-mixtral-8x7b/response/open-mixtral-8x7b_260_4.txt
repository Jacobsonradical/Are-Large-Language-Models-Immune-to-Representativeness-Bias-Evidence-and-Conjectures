To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height)

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of that height and the witness erroneously identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
