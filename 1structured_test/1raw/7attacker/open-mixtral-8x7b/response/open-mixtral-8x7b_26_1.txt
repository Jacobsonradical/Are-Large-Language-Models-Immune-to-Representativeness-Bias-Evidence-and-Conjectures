Given the information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness, there's an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height, and a 20% chance of error.

First, let's consider the scenario where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The witness, being correct 80% of the time, would report the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the correct identification.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the witness, being incorrect 20% of the time, might report the attacker as 185 cm or taller, but this would be an error.

Since we don't know whether the witness is correct or not, we need to account for both possibilities. To do this, we use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B represents the event that the witness reported the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We have been given P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct)
And P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrect)

We also have P(A) = 0.15 (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B) which is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1-P(A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
