To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the two pieces of information, we have:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller) = a
P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller) = b
P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller | attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness identifies attacker as shorter than 185cm | attacker is shorter than 185cm) = 0.8
P(attacker is shorter than 185cm) = 0.85

We want to find P(attacker is 185cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller)
= P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller | attacker is 185cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185cm or taller) / P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller)
= (0.8 * a) / ((0.8 * a) + (0.2 * (1-a)))

Since we don't have a specific value for a, we can't give a single numerical estimate. However, we can calculate the probability for different values of a between 0 and 1, if that would be helpful.

Here's a table of some possible values of a and their corresponding estimated probabilities:

a = 0.5: 0.6667
a = 0.7: 0.7778
a = 0.8: 0.8421
a = 0.9: 0.9130
a = 1: 1

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on our prior belief about the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. If we assume that a is at least 0.8, then the estimated probability is at least 0.8421.
