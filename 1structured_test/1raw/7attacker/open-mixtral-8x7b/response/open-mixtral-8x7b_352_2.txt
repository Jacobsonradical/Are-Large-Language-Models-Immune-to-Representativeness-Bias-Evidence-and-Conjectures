To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given as 15% or 0.15
P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height when it is 185 cm or taller, given as 80% or 0.8
P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height when it is shorter than 185 cm, given as 20% or 0.2
P(not A) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given as 85% or 0.85

Now we calculate:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(B) = P(A and B) + P(not A and B) = 0.12 + P(not A and B)

To calculate P(not A and B), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = P(not A and B) / P(not A)

0.2 = P(not A and B) / 0.85

P(not A and B) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Given the information and using the provided conditional probabilities, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
