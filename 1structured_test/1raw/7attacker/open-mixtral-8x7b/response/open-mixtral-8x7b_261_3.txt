To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define the following events:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4861

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4861, or 48.61%.
