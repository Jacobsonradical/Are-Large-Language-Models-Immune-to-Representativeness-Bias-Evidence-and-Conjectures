To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of H given E. By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

From (a), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

From (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

To find P(E), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We have:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H),

where ~H represents the complementary event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(~H) = 0.85 by (a). We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(E|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.1445) = 0.15 / 0.2945 â‰ˆ 0.509.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.509}
