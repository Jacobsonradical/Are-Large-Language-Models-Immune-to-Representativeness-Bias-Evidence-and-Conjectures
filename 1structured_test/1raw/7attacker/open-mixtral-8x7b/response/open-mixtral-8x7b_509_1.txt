To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. If the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, then the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and was correct is:

0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, the witness also errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller but was actually shorter than 185 cm is:

0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is:

Probability: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.4118 or 41.18% (rounded to two decimal places).
