To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information and apply a bit of conditional probability.

First, we know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. However, this includes all people, regardless of whether they were involved in the attack or not. The witness's testimony provides some additional information that can help us refine our estimate.

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people half of whom are shorter than 185 cm and half of whom are 185 cm or taller. This means that the witness's false positive rate (identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) is 20%, and their false negative rate (failing to identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are) is also 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability that the witness is correct given this information. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:

* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we know is 15% or 0.15)
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which we know is 80% or 0.8)
* P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we still need to calculate P(B|not A) and P(not A).

* P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.
* P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which we know is 20% or 0.2.

So, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.321

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.321.
