To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and making errors 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15 based on the information provided).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 based on the information provided).
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2 based on the information provided, since the witness makes errors 20% of the time).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, note that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, let's calculate the terms:

P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)] = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
