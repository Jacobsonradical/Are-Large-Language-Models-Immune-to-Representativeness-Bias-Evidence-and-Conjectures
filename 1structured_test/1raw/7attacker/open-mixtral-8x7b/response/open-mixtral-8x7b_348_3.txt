To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (Hypothesis H) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (Evidence E).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

From the given data, we have:
