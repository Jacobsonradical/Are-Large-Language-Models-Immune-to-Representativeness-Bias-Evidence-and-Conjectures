To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): Probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness identified it as such (our estimate)

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
