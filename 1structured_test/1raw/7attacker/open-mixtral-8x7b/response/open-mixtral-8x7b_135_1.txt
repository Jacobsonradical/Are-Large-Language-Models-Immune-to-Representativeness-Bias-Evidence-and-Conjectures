To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 15% (given in the problem statement)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Calculating P(B|A):
The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8

Calculating P(B|¬A):
The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, calculating P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.195

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.195 ≈ 0.615

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.615 (or 61.5%).
