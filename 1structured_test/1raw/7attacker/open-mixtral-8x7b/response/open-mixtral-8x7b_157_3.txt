To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8)*(0.15) + P(B|A') * (1 - 0.15)

Here, A' denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(B|A') is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which we know from the problem statement is 20% (0.2).

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
