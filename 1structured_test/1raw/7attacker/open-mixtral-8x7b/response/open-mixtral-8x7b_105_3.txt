To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after considering new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the evidence from the witness.

We are asked to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(D|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(D|not H) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(not H), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(D), the probability of the evidence, which is the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the probabilities of the evidence given the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(D) = P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|not H) * P(not H)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|D), the probability we are interested in:
P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
