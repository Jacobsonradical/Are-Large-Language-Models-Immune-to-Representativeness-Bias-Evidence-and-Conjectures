To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
≈ 0.386

My estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.386}
