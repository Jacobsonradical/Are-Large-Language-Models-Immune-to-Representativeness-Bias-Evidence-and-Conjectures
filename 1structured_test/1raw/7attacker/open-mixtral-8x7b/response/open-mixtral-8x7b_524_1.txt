To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the base rate of people's height in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

First, let's calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can compute P(B|not A) * P(not A):

P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, using the values above, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.31

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.31 (or 31%).
