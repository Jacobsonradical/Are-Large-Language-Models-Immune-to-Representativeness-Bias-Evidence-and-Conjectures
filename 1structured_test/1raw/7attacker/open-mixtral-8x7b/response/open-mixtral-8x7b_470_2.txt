To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the witness's accuracy. We will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are interested in P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

First, we need to calculate the base rate P(A):
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(B|A):
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8

Now, calculate the probability of the witness identifying a non-185 cm attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(B|¬A):
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.

My final answer is:
probability: 0.4138
