To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (A) given that they were identified as such by the witness (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + [P(B|not A) * (1 - 0.15)]

The term P(B|not A) represents the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [(0.8)*(0.15)] / (0.35)
â‰ˆ 0.3429

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3429 or 34.29%.
