To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability, which is P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Also, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 and P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(B), we get:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 approximately.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
