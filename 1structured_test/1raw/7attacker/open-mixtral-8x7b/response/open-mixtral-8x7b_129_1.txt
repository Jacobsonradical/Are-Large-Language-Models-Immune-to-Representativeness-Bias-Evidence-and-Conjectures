To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the two events as follows:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.5 (witness mistakenly identified height 50% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 1
