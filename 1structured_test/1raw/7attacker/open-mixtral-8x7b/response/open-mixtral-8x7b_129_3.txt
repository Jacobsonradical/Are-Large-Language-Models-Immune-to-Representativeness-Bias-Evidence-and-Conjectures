To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A): the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we need to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plug in the numbers:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculate:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
