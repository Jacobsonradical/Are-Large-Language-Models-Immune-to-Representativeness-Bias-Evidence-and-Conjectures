To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the prior probability, P(A), that a person is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given their actual height, P(B|A). We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time:
P(B|A) = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, P(B|¬A). We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller:
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|B), that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
