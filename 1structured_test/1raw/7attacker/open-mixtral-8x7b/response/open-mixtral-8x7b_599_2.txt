To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the witness made an error.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

Therefore, P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
