To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).

Next, we need to determine P(A). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We also know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. To find P(B|not A), we need to consider the cases in which the attacker's height is less than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
