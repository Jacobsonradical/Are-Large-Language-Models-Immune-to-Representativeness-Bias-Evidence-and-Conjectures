To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% of the time, but this is for people who are not 185 cm or taller)

We also need to know P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
