To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem, this is calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we know:
- P(B|A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B): this is what we want to calculate. It's the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and it can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for each possible height. However, since we don't know the exact distribution of heights in the population, we cannot calculate this directly.

However, there is a trick we can use here. Since what we are really interested in is the ratio P(A|B) / P(A), and this ratio does not require knowing the absolute value of P(B), we can simplify Bayes' theorem by canceling out P(B):

P(A|B) / P(A) = P(B|A) / 1 

So, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is:

{probability: 0.12}
