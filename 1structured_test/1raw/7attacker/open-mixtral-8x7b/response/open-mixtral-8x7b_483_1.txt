To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the given information.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the given information.
- P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 based on the given information.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's compute the denominator:
- P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can compute the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / 0.29 = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
