To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2 * 0.35 = 0.07)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.07 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.0595)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.1795
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.6668

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (or 67%).
