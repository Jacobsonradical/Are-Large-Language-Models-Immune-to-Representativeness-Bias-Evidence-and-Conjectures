To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (A is true) and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (A is false).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Thus, P(not A) = 0.85, and we need to find P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345 or 34.5%.
