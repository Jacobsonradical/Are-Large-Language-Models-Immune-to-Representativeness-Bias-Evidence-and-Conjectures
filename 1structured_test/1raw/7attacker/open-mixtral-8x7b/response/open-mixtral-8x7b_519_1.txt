To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller (from point a).

However, the witness's ability to judge a person's height comes into play here (from point b). We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs (identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not) 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller, we can combine these probabilities using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from point a)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
     = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
