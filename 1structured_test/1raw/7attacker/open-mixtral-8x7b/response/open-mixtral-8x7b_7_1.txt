To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.5 (the witness guessed the height correctly half of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, to find P(A|B), we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):

P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425

Now, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.425] â‰ˆ 0.2568

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2568}
