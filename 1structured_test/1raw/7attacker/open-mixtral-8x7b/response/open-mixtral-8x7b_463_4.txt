To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 85% = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can now calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability we are interested in, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
~ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
