To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We have the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
2. P(B|A) = Probability that a witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
3. P(B|not A) = Probability that a witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when judging a person's height)

Now, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using the total probability theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's find P(not A):
P(not A) = 100% - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 0.375 (37.5%).
