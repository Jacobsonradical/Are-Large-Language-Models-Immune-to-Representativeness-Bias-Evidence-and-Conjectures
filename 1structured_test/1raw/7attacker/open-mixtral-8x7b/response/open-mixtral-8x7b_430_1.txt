To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (from part b)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from part a, this is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from part a, this is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
