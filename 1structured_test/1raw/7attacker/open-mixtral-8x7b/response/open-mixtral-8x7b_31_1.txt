To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to the given information.
- P(B) as the probability that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|A) as the probability that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the accuracy of the witness when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 according to the given information.
- P(B|not A) as the probability that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller. This means that the person is shorter than 185 cm, and since the witness errs 20% of the time in this case, this probability is 20% or 0.2.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(B) can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A), and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 85% or 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414.

So, my estimate is {probability: 0.414}.
