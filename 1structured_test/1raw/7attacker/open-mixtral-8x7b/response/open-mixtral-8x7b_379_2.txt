To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We're asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, as 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
We can calculate P(¬B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a tall person as not tall, as 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2.
We can calculate P(¬B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies a short person as not tall, as P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
≈ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided is approximately 0.36.
