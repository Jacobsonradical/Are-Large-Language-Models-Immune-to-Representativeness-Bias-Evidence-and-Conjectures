To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. According to the witness's ability to judge a person's height, they correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 or 80%.

However, we are interested in the reverse probability: the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A) is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 or 80%.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

P(B and A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 or 80%.

P(B and not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller, which is the false positive rate or 1 - P(B|not A). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when judging a person's height, P(B|not A) is 0.2 or 20%, and therefore P(B and not A) is 0.8 or 80%.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 (B and A) + 0.8 (B and not A) = 0.8 + 0.8 = 1.6.

Now we can calculate the reverse probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 1.6 = 0.075 / 1.6 â‰ˆ 0.046875 or 4.6875%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.046875}
