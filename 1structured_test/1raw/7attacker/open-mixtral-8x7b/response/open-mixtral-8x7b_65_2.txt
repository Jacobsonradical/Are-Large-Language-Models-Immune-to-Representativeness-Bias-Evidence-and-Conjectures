To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we can use the formula:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from a)
- P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from b)
- P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.34

Then, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.34 = 0.36 or 36%

The answer is: {probability: 0.36}
