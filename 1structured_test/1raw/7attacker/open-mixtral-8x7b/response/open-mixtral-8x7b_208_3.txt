To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given by the statement "85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller." So P(A) = 0.15

P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, given by the statement "A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time." So P(B|A) = 0.8

P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, given by the statement "the witness erred in 20% of the cases." So P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We need to compute P(not A):

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, compute P(B|not A) * P(not A):

P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
