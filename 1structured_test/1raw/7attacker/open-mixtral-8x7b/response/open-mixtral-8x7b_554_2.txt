To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
