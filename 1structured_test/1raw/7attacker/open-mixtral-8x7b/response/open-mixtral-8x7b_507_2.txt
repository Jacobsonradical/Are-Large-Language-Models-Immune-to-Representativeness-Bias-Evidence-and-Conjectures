To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) =
