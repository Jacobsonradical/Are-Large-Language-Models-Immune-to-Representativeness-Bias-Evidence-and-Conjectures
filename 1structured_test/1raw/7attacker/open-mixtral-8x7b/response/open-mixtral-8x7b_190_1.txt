To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities - the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is 0.41.
