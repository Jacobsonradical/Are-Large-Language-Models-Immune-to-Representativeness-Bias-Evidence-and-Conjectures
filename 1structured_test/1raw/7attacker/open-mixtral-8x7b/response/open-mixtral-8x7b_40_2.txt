To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define our events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.50 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the true height is less than 185 cm, so they incorrectly identify as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

We know or can calculate all the terms in this equation except for P(not A). Since P(not A) + P(A) = 1, then P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate:
P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.80)(0.15) = 0.12
P(W|not A) * P(not A) = (0.50)(0.85) = 0.425

So,
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.425) = 0.12 / 0.545 â‰ˆ 0.22

{probability: 0.22}
