To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 50% = 0.5 (since the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller, and 50% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate the denominator:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Now, calculate the numerator:

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.545 ≈ 0.22

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
