To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller in the city, we can set up a probability table as follows:

| Actual Height | Witness Identification | Probability |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 185 cm or taller | Correctly identified  | 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4  |
| 185 cm or taller | Incorrectly identified as shorter | 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1  |
| Shorter than 185 cm | Incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller | 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1  |
| Shorter than 185 cm | Correctly identified as shorter | 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4  |

Based on the table, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4 or 40%.

Answer: {probability: 0.4}
