To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the reliability of the witness.

First, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. Let's assume that this applies to the pool of potential attackers as well. 

Next, we are told that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This implies that there is an 80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a person of that height and a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller if they are not.

Given these probabilities, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller by using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (population statistic)

We need to calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), which can be broken down into two scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies them as such.
2. The attacker is not 185 cm or taller, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as such.

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller AND Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller AND Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
