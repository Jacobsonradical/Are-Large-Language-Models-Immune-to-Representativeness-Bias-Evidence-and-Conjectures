To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis after considering new evidence.

Here, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H) based on the city's population:
P(H) = Probability of an individual being 185 cm or taller
= Number of people who are 185 cm or taller / Total population
= 15% (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H, denoted as P(E|H). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:
P(E|H) = Probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
= 80% (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

However, we also need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence E given the opposite of the hypothesis, denoted as P(E|~H). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller:
P(E|~H) = Probability of incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
= 20% (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Finally, we need to calculate the total probability of the evidence P(E), which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H) weighted by their respective probabilities:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.414.
