To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We will use Bayes' theorem to calculate this.

Let's denote:
- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was actually 185 cm or taller)

P(A') = 85% = 0.85 (the complementary probability of P(A))

P(B|A') = 20% = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3448}
