To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence, i.e., the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From the problem, we know:
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to find the total probability of the evidence E, which can occur from two scenarios: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A), or the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (A').

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|A') * P(A')

For the second scenario, the witness would incorrectly identify a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which happens 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|A') = 0.2. And, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(A') = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now, we can calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 = 0.12 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4286 or 42.86%.
