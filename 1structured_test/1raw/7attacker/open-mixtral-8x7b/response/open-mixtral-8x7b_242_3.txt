To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(¬E): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (85%)
- Sensitivity: probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person (0.8)
- False Positive Rate (FPR): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller (0.2)

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Now, let's calculate the terms in the formula.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the sensitivity (0.8).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is the value we want to find.

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This is equal to the FPR (0.2).

P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A).

Now, we have:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of P(A). However, we can provide a range of possible values for P(A) based on the available information.

If P(A) = 1, meaning the attacker is certainly 185 cm or taller, then P(A|B) = 0.8.

If P(A) = 0.15 (the same as P(E)), then P(A|B) = 0.64.

Since the value of P(A) cannot be lower than 0.15 without making the witness's identification useless (as the attacker would still be more likely to be shorter than 185 cm), we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as being at least 0.15:

{probability: 0.15}
