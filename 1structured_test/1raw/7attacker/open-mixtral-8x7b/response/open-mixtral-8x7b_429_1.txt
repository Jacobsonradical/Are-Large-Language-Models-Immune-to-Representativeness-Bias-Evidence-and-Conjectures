To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification and the population statistics.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller (event A). According to the given information, the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of event A is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (event B). According to the given information, the witness erred 20% of the time when identifying a person's height, which means that they incorrectly identified a person who was shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of event B is 0.2.

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct based on the population statistics. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. If we assume that the witness's identification is random with respect to the population, then the probability of the witness's identification being correct is equal to the sum of the probability of event A and the probability of event B weighted by the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

Therefore, the probability of the witness's identification being correct is:

P(correct identification) = P(event A) x P(population is 185 cm or taller) + P(event B) x P(population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(correct identification) = 0.8 x 0.15 + 0.2 x 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

This means that there is a 29% chance that the witness's identification is correct. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

probability: 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.71 x 0.85) = 0.29 / 0.94 = 0.309

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.309 (or 30.9%).
