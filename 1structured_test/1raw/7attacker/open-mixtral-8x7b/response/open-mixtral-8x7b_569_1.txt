To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's information
P(E) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height)
P(~E) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm (regardless of the attacker's actual height)

From (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (P(E|A)) and errs 20% of the time (P(~E|A)). From (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (P(A)) and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (P(~A)). We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's information.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(B|A) = P(E|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = P(E|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(~A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
