To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):
[P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.
