To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when given a sample of people with half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm) as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of this error is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

To estimate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = (prior probability * probability of correct identification) / (prior probability * probability of correct identification + (1 - prior probability) * probability of incorrect identification)

posterior probability = (0.85 * 0.8) / (0.85 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.85) * 0.2)

posterior probability = 0.68

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.68}
