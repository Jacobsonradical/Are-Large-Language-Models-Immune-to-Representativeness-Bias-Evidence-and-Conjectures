To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 20% = 0.2 (¬A is the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 34.5%.
