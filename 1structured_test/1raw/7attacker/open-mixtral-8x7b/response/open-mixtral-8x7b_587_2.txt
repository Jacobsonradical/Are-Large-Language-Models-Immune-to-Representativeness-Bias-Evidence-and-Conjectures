To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- S: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- H: the event that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A) given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (S). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|S) = P(S|A) * P(A) / P(S)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(S|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(S) = P(S|A) * P(A) + P(S|not A) * P(not A)
- P(S|not A) = 1 - P(not S|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(S):

P(S) = P(S|A) * P(A) + P(S|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.06 = 0.86

Now, we can find P(A|S):

P(A|S) = P(S|A) * P(A) / P(S) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.86 â‰ˆ 0.1395

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1395.
