Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is the witness's correct identification rate, which is 80%.

Next, we calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

The total probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities. However, this total probability applies to a random person in the general population, not specifically to the attacker.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider that the attacker came from the subset of the population that was 185 cm or taller, not from the whole population. 

The attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is therefore 80% (the witness's correct identification rate) of the probability that a randomly chosen person from this subset is 185 cm or taller. 

The probability that a randomly chosen person from this subset is 185 cm or taller is 100% because we know that the attacker is in this subset. But since the witness's correct identification rate is 80%, the final estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 80%.
