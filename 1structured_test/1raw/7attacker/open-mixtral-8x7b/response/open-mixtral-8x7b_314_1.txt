To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = P(height >= 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness correctly identifies height) = 80% = 0.8

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the sum of two probabilities:
1. P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
