To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

First, let's find the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller:

P(Correctly identified tall person) = 0.80

Next, let's find the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city:

P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified tall) =
P(Witness identified tall | Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) *
P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) /
P(Witness identified tall)

We need to find the probability of the witness identifying a tall person, which is:

P(Witness identified tall) = P(Witness identified tall | Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) +
P(Witness identified tall | Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

P(Witness identified tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.80) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.245

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified tall) =
0.80 * 0.15 / 0.245 â‰ˆ 0.4896

The answer is:
{probability: 0.4896}
