To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:
P(a person is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85
P(witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller even if they are shorter) = 20% = 0.2

P(B and not A) = P(not A) * P(witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller even if they are shorter) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
