To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we have:
P(A) = probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = probability of witness correctly identifying height = 80% = 0.8

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
