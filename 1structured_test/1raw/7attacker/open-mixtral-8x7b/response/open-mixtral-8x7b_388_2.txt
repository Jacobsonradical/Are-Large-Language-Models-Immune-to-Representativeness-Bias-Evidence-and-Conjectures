To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the accuracy of the witness.

First, let's consider the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller: P(Taller) = 15% or 0.15.

Next, we need to account for the accuracy of the witness. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can express this as conditional probabilities:

P(WitnessRight | Taller) = 0.8
P(WitnessWrong | Not Taller) = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Taller | WitnessRight) = P(WitnessRight | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(WitnessRight)

To calculate P(WitnessRight), we need to account for both cases where the person is actually 185 cm or taller and where the witness is simply mistaken:

P(WitnessRight) = P(WitnessRight | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(WitnessRight | Not Taller) * P(Not Taller)

Given that half of the city's population is 185 cm or taller and half is shorter, we have P(Not Taller) = 0.5 and P(WitnessWrong | Not Taller) = 0.2 as before.

P(WitnessRight) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Taller | WitnessRight) = P(WitnessRight | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(WitnessRight) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.545}
