To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Next, we'll compute P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.205 + 0.17 = 0.375

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = 0.2 / 0.375 ≈ 0.53

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.53}.
