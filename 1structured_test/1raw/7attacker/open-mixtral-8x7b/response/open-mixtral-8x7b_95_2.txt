To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H and the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as E.

We are given:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We need to calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
