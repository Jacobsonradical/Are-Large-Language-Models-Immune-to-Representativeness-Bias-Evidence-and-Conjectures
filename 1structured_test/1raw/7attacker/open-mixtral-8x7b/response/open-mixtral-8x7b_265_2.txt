To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information:
P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% of the time)

Now, let's find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This involves two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A)
- The witness will correctly identify this as 80% * 15% = 0.12

Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm (event ~A)
- The witness will incorrectly identify this as 20% * 85% = 0.17

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ~A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Answer: {probability: 0.414}
