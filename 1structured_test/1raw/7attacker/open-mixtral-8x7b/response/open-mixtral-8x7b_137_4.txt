To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

First, let's find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, 15% of the population fits this description, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is given as 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the opposite scenario: the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. According to the information, the witness errs 20% of the time in these cases. Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of a randomly chosen person being shorter than 185 cm is 0.5. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

Plugging in our values:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5556

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.5556 or 55.56%.
