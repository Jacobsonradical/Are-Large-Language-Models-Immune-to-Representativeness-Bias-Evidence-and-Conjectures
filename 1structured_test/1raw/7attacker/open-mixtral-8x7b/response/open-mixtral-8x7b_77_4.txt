To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
2. 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both cases: the witness is correct and the witness is incorrect.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time:

P(B|not A) = 0.2

And P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
