To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
2. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's consider two hypotheses:
- H1: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- H2: The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

In this scenario, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, so we want to find the probability of H1 being true given the observed information.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of H1:

P(H1|Observation) = [P(Observation|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(Observation|H1) * P(H1) + P(Observation|H2) * P(H2)]

Here, P(H1) = 0.15 and P(H2) = 0.85, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(Observation|H1) = 0.8.

Now, we need to find P(Observation|H2), which is the probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(Observation|H2) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of H1:

P(H1|Observation) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.096 / 0.266 â‰ˆ 0.3612

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3612.
