To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the reliability of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rate. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the witness's reliability. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (in this case, the witness's identification) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, and divided by the probability of the evidence:

P(hypothesis | evidence) = P(evidence | hypothesis) x P(hypothesis) / P(evidence)

We already know the values of P(evidence | hypothesis) (the witness's reliability) and P(hypothesis) (the base rate). To compute P(evidence), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. Since the witness is equally likely to mistakenly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller as they are to correctly identify a person who is actually 185 cm or taller, we can compute P(evidence) as:

P(evidence) = 0.5 x P(hypothesis) + 0.5 x P(not hypothesis)
= 0.5 x 0.15 + 0.5 x 0.85
= 0.5 x 0.15 + 0.425
= 0.575

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(hypothesis | evidence) = P(evidence | hypothesis) x P(hypothesis) / P(evidence)
= 0.8 x 0.15 / 0.575
= 0.0976

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0976, or 9.76%.
