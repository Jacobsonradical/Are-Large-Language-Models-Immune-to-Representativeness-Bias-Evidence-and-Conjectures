To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the witness's accuracy.

1. The base rate is 15% (or 0.15) since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (sensitivity) and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (false positive rate).
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

4. We want to find P(A|B), so first, let's compute P(B|A):

P(B|A) = sensitivity = 0.8

5. Next, we computed P(A):

P(A) = base rate = 0.15

6. Now we need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

7. Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
= 0.12 / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.4286

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.43 (43%).
