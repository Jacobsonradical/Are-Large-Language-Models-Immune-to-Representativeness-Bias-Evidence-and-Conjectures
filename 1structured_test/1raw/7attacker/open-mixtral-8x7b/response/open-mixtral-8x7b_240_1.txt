To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller

We are given P(E) = 0.15 and the witness's ability to judge a person's height: P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B'|A') = 0.8 (complementary probability).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
