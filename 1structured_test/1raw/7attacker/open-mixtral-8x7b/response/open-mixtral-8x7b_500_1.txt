To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B|C) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
2. P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(C|B), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|not C) * P(not C)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(C|B):

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
