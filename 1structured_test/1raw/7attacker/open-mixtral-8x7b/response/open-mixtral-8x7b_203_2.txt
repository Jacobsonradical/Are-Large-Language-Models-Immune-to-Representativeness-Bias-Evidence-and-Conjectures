To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8)
- P(W|¬A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2)
- P(A'): Probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85, given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A'): Probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

We can calculate P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) as:
(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
