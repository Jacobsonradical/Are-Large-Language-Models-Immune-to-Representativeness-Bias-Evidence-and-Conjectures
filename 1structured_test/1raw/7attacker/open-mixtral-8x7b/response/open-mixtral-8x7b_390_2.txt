To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information provided, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the actual height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller, but the witness still identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, we compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now we can calculate the denominator of Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.17) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
