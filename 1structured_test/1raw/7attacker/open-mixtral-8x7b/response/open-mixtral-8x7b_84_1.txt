To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B, which is:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we're given P(A) = 15% (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Next, we need to calculate P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now, we need to calculate P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, or the witness makes an error and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

We already know P(B and A), which is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

To calculate P(B and not A), we need to find the probability that the witness identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller and the probability that a shorter person is mistaken for the attacker:

- Shorter person: 85% of the population, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(B and not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
