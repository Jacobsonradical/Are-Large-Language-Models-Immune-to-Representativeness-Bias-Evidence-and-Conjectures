To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = P(attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|not A) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller) = 20% = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
P(not A) = P(attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
