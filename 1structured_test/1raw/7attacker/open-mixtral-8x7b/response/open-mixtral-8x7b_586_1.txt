To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller) and P(C) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B). We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. To find P(B|not A), we need to find the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the height as 185 cm or taller when the person was actually shorter than 185 cm. The witness erred in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, let's find P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
