To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics provided.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when given a sample of people with equal numbers of those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. This means that the witness's false positive rate is 100% - 80% = 20%.

From statement "b", we know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(T). We want to estimate P(T) given the witness's statement and population statistics.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(T) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)]

Here,
- P(W|T) is the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the witness's 80% accuracy rate, so P(W|T) = 0.8.
- P(T) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
- P(W|not T) is the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the witness's 20% error rate, so P(W|not T) = 0.2.
- P(not T) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(T).

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and assuming the attacker is representative of the general population, we can estimate P(T) as 0.15.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find the estimated probability:

P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(T) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(T) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(T) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
