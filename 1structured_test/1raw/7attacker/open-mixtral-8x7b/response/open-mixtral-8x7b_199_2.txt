To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is denoted as P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness errs in their judgment. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A), is 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Now, we have all the required information to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.09 / 0.26
P(A|B) = 0.346153846154

The final estimate is: {probability: 0.35} (rounded to two decimal places).
