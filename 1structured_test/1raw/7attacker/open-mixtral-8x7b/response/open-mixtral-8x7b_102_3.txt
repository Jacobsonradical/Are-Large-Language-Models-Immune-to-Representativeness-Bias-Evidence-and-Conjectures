To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

And calculate P(not A|B), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Plug in the values:
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate P(not A|B):
P(not A|B) = (0.20 * 0.85) / 0.29 = 0.17 / 0.29 ≈ 0.5862

Finally, calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = 1 - P(not A|B) = 1 - 0.5862 ≈ 0.4138

In the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
