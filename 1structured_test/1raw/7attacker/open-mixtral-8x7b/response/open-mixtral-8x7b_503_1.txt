To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

What we want to find is:
P(A|B) = probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
