To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A'): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we have:
1. P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(W|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
3. P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A):

P(A) = P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')]
P(A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
