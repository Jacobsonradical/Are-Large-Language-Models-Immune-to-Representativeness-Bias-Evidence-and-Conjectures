To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Using the given information, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(T) = P(Witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | The person is actually 185 cm or taller) * P(The person is actually 185 cm or taller)

First, we calculate P(Witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | The person is actually 185 cm or taller):
- We know the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- Thus, P(Witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | The person is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we calculate P(The person is actually 185 cm or taller):
- We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- Thus, P(The person is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(T):
- P(T) = P(Witness identifies person as 185 cm or taller | The person is actually 185 cm or taller) * P(The person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15
- P(T) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
