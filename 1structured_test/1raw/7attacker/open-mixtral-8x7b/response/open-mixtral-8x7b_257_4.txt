To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller

From the problem, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3158 or 31.58%.
