To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the total probability theorem. We need to find the probability of the witness being correct when identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the two possible scenarios: the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(taller | witness identifies taller) = P(witness identifies taller | taller) * P(taller) + P(witness identifies taller | shorter) * P(shorter)

From the information provided:
- P(taller) = 15% (0.15)
- P(shorter) = 85% (0.85)
- P(witness identifies taller | taller) = 80% (0.8)
- P(witness identifies taller | shorter) = 20% (0.2) (the witness errs in 20% of cases when the person is shorter)

Now, we can compute the probability:
P(taller | witness identifies taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(taller | witness identifies taller) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(taller | witness identifies taller) = 0.29 or 29%

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
