To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the true height is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.4957

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4957}
