To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

From the first piece of information, we know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

(probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population) x (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller) + (probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm) x (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)

= (0.15) x (0.8) + (0.85) x (0.2)

= 0.12 + 0.17

= 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 or 29%.
