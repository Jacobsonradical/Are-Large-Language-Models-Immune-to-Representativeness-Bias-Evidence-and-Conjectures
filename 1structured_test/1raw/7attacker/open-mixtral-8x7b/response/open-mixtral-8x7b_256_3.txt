To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80%. Then, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 20%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability and consider two cases:

1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probabilities of these two cases and add them together.

Case 1:
P(185 cm or taller) * P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Case 2:
P(Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Incorrectly identified | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, add the probabilities from Case 1 and Case 2:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.29}.
