To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to construct a conditional probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified them as such)

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identifies correctly | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

From the given information, we have:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(Witness identifies correctly | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8

Now we need to calculate P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identifies incorrectly) * P(Attacker is shorter)

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter. Thus:

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified them as such) = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
