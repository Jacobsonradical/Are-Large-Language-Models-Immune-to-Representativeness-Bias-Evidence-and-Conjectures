To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

From (a), 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. We want to find out the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.

From (b), the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This means that the false positive rate is 100% - 80% = 20%.

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to weigh the prior probability (population percentage) by the witness's accuracy.

P(taller) = P(taller | witness statement) * P(witness statement) + P(taller | not witness statement) * P(not witness statement)

P(taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

P(taller) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(taller) = 0.29 or 29%

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 or 29%.
