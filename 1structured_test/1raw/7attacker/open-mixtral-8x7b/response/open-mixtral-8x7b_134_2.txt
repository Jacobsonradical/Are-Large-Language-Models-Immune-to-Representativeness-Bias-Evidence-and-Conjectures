To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and O represent the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(O|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|O), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

To find P(O), we can use the law of total probability:
P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|¬A) * P(¬A)

We don't directly know P(O|¬A), the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. However, since the witness makes errors, P(O|¬A) is the sum of the true positive rate of the witness (0.8 for people 185 cm or taller) and the false positive rate (0.2 for people shorter than 185 cm).

P(O|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(O):
P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|O):
P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
