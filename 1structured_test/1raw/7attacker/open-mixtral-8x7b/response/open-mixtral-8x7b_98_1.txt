To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the available information.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we have the following probabilities:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

From statement (b), we have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city population)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the city population)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.4286

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4286}
