To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the information about the witness's observation and the general population's height distribution.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 80%, or 0.8.
2. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is 0.15.
3. P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy. Furthermore, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.38 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 1.31 (rounded to 1 decimal place, this is 1.3, but the probability should be between 0 and 1, so we interpret this as 100% * 1.3 / 3.3 â‰ˆ 39%.)
