To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs in light of evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From statement (a), we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of erring in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

From statement (b), we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on city population statistics)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm based on city population statistics)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the evidence, regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate this as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the evidence under each condition:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

The final answer is:
{probability: 0.345}
