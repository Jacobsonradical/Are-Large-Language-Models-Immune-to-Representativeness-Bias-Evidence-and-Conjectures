To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness identification (B).

P(A) = 15% or 0.15 (from statement b)
P(B|A) = 80% or 0.8 (from statement a)
P(B|¬A) = 85% of 85% = 0.7225 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness identifying someone shorter as 185 cm or taller is 85% of 85%)
P(¬A) = 100% - 15% = 85% or 0.85 (100% - probability of A)

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Now, we can substitute the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.7225 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.618)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.1627 or 16.27%

The answer is:
{probability: 0.1627}
