To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B and A):
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, let's find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= 0.12 + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.12 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= 0.12 / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4537

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4537 or 45.37%.
