To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the population data.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm
- P(C): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city population
- P(C'): probability that a person is shorter than 1
