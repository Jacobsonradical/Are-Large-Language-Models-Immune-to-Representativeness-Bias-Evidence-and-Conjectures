To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. When presented with a sample of people that is half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness's judgments are not always correct, but they are correct more often than not.

Next, let's consider the population statistics. In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that if the attacker is randomly selected from the city's population, there is a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.

To combine the witness's accuracy with the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is equal to the product of the prior probability (the probability of the event before considering any additional information, in this case the population statistics) and the likelihood (the probability of the additional information given the event, in this case the witness's accuracy), divided by the probability of the additional information (in this case the overall accuracy of the witness).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(185 cm or taller | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%)
* P(witness | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(witness) = P(witness | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness | shorter than 185 cm) \* P(shorter than 185 cm)

We are also given that P(witness | shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases) and P(shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these probabilities into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Calculating this, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36, or 36%.
