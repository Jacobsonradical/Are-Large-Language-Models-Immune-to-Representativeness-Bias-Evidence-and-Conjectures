Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. However, we must also consider that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
4. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we cannot directly use the information about the city's population. Instead, we should consider the witnessed report as a new piece of evidence.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller based on the witness's report.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(T) = 0.15 (15% probability based on city statistics)
P(S|T) = 0.8 (witness correct identification rate)
P(S|not T) = 0.2 (witness error rate)

We want to find P(T|S), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / [P(S|T) * P(T) + P(S|not T) * P(not T)]

First, calculate P(not T): P(not T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85

Now, calculate P(S|not T) * P(not T): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Next, calculate the denominator: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.295

Finally, calculate P(T|S): 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.295 â‰ˆ 0.4068

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4068 or 40.68%.
