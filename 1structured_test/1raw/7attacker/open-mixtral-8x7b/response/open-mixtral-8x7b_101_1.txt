To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).

We also need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness erred 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (because 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4524

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4524}
