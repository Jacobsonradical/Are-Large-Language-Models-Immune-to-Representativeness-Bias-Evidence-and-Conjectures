To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we have the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 20% * 0.85 = 0.15, given that the witness is wrong)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's find P(¬A) (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (as calculated above)

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1275
P(B) = 0.2475

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2475
P(A|B) ≈ 0.485

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.485 or 48.5%.
