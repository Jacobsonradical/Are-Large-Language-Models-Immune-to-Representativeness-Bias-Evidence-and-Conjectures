To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In our case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.50 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means they correctly identify the other category 80% of the time which is the majority category)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.50 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.425)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2213 or 22.13%

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 22.13%.
