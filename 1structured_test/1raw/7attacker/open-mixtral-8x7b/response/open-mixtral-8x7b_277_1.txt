To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they actually are not)

We want to find: P(A|B)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Then, calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
