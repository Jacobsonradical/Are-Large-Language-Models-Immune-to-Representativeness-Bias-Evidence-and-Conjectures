To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the given information.

P(B|A) is the probability of observing the witness's statement, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(B|not A) is the probability of observing the witness's statement, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. The witness errs in 20% of these cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(B) is the probability of observing the witness's statement, regardless of the attacker's height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
