To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15%)
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (80%)
- P(B|not A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (20%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we need to find the probabilities of B given A and B given not A. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can plug these values into the formula and compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
