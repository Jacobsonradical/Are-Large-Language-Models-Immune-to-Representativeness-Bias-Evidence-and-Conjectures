To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the two possible scenarios for the attacker's height:

1. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which has an 85% probability based on the city's population.
2. The attacker is 185 cm or taller, which has a 15% probability based on the city's population.

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height accurately 80% of the time and erroneously 20% of the time.

We need to calculate the probability of the witness being correct about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller and the probability of the witness being incorrect about the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm.

P(correct) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person)
P(incorrect) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We want to estimate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) =
P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(correct) =
P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can rearrange to get an estimate for P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller):

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) =
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(correct) / P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, P(correct) = 0.80, and the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios, weighted by the probabilities of the attacker's height:

P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) =
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(correct) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(incorrect)

Plugging in the values:

P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) =
0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can compute the final estimate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) =
0.15 * 0.80 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
