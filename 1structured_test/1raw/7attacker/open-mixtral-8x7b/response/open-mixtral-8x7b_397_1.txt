To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

From the given information, we know that the witness identified the attacker's height correctly 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and erred 20% of the time. We can use this information to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A) \* P(A) / P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We are interested in finding P(A), so we can rearrange the equation to solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A) \* P(A) / P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A), we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A) = 0.8

To calculate P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability and the population statistics:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A) \* P(A) + P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | not A) \* P(not A)

We know that P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | A) = 0.8 and P(not A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). To calculate P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | not A), we can use the witness's error rate:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | not A) = 0.2

Putting everything together, we get:

P(A) = 0.8 \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* 0.15)

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.96 or 96%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.96}
