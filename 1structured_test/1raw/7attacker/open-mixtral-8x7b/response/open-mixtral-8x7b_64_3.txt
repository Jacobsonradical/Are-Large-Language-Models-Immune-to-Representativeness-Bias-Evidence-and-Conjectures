To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the prior probability, i.e., the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city's population. According to the information provided, 15% of the population meets this criterion. So, the prior probability is 0.15.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time in such cases. Therefore, the likelihood is 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This happens 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the likelihood of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = (prior probability * likelihood) / (prior probability * likelihood + likelihood of error)

posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.17))

posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.59 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.59}
