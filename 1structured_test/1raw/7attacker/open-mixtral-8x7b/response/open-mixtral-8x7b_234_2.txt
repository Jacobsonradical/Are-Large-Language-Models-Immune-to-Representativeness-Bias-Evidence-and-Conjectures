To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when it is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when it is less than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Calculating the terms:
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Substituting the terms into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)]

Now, simplifying:
P(A|B) ≈ 0.82 (82%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 82%.
