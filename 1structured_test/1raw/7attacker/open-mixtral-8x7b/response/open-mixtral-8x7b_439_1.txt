To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: A witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, they will incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the complementary event ¬A is 0.85. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.454

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.454 (or 45.4%).
