To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define our terms:
H = height of the attacker is 185 cm or taller
D = the data, which is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the question, we know two probabilities:
P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

What we want to find is P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / P(D)

To find P(D), the probability of the data, we need to consider all possibilities, not just when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. So, P(D) = P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H), where ~H represents the complement of H (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the question, we know that the witness errs 20% of the time. So, P(D|~H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(D), we get:
P(D) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H|D):
P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / P(D) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
