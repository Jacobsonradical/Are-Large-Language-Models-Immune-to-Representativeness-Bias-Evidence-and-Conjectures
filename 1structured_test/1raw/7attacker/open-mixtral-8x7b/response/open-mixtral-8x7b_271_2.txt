To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the population statistics. We will use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Let's define two events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find the probabilities P(B|A) and P(A).

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8, as given in the information.

P(A) is the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller in the city. This probability is 0.15, as given in the information.

Now, let's find P(B). To do this, we need to consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Here, A' is the complementary event of A (the attacker being shorter than 185 cm) and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(B|A'). This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2.

So, P(B|A') = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
