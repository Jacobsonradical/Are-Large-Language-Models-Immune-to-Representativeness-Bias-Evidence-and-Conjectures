To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are A: "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B: "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A is true) and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A is false). We can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

where ~A denotes the complement of A (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 1.19

However, this value is greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability. This indicates that there is some error or inconsistency in the given information or the calculations.

Therefore, I cannot provide a valid estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information.
