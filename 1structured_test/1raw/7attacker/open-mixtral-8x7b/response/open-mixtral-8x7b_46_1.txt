To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We are given P(B|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(B|A') and P(A'), where A' is the complementary event of A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3448

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3448}
