To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (a) and the accuracy of the witness (b). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. Similarly, P(B|A') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, where A' is the event that the person is not 185 cm or taller.

From (a), P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85
From (b), P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|A') = 0.2

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

P(B) is the probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether they are or not. This can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Then, we calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
