To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we have:

P(A): Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city = 15% = 0.15
P(B): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(~B): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider all possible heights and the witness's accuracy:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. It is the complement of the witness's accuracy:
P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 80% = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
