To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by considering all possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the witness correctly identifies the height (B|A). This happens with probability P(B|A) * P(A).
2. The attacker is not 185 cm or taller (¬A), and the witness incorrectly identifies the height (B|¬A). This happens with probability P(B|¬A) * P(¬A).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.4211

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4211 or 42.11%.
