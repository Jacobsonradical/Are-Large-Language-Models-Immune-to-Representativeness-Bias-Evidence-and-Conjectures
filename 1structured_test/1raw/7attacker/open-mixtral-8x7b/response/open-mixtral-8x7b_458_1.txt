To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and O represent the observed information from the witness.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

From statement (a), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

From statement (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time, so P(O|A) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the probability of observing the witness' identification given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate using the witness' error rate. The witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(O|not A) = 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate the overall probability of observing the witness' identification, P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|not A) * P(not A)

P(O) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

P(A|O) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
