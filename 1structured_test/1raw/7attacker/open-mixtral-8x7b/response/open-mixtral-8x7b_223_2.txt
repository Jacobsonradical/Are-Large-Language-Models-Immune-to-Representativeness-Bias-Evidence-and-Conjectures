To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller
- P(~E): probability that the witness identifies the attacker incorrectly as 185 cm or taller
- P(H): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city
- P(~H): probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the city

From the given information, we have:
P(A|B) = 1 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(~E|H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) / P(B|A)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|H) * P(H) + P(B|~H) * P(~H)

Now, we need to find P(B|H) and P(B|~H). We know that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So, we can write:
P(B|H) = P(E|H) = 0.8
P(B|~H) = P(~E|~H) = 0.2 (because if the person is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will be wrong when identifying the height as 185 cm or taller)

Substituting these values in, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(B|A) = P(B and A) / P(A)

We already found P(B) and P(A) = P(H) = 0.15. To find P(B and A), we need to find the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is equal to P(E|H), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(B and A) = P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Substituting these values in, we get:
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.8

Now, we can compute our final estimate:
Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller: {probability: 0.18}

The witness's identification of the attacker as 185 cm or taller (event B) is more likely caused by the attacker's actual height being 185 cm or taller (event A) rather than the witness being incorrect (event ~E). However, the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is still relatively low due to the low base rate (0.15) and the imperfect accuracy of the witness (probability of 0.8 that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller).
