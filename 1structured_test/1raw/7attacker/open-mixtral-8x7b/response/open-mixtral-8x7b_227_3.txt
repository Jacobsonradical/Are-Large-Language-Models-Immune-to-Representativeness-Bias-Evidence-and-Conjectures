To reason through this problem, we need to consider both the base rate (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

1. The base rate is 15% (or 0.15) since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the sensitivity of the witness is 0.8 and the false positive rate is 0.2.
3. However, we also need to consider the false positive rate because the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, but the victim couldn't see the attacker's height.
4. To calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem.
5. The formula would be: P(185 cm | witness) = P(witness | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(witness)
6. Since we don't have information about the overall rate of people being identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness, we cannot directly calculate P(witness).
7. However, we can still estimate the posterior probability as the product of the base rate and the sensitivity, divided by the sum of the base rate, the sensitivity, the false positive rate, and one minus the base rate (to account for all possible outcomes).
8. Plugging in our values: P(185 cm | witness) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / ((0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2) + (0.15))
9. Calculating this value results in approximately 0.35, or 35%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.35}.
