To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the city's population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 0.85 probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This also means that there is a 0.15 probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.

However, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which may introduce some uncertainty in our estimate. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To incorporate both pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) x P(H) / P(E)

We already know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) x P(H) + P(E|not H) x P(not H)

We need to find P(E|not H), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually not 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's error rate when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm:

P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

We also know that P(not H) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) x P(H) + P(E|not H) x P(not H)
= 0.8 x 0.15 + 0.2 x 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) x P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 x 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.38

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.38}
