To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, P(B) = 0.15.

We need to find the probability of observing the witness's evidence (the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller) given that the attacker's true height is 185 cm or taller, P(E|A), as well as the probability of observing the same evidence given that the attacker's true height is not 185 cm or taller, P(E|¬A).

1) P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

2) P(E|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(A), given the witness's evidence.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A))

We know P(E|A), P(E|¬A), and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A). We don't know P(A) yet, so let's denote it as x, and solve for x:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * x) / ((0.8 * x) + (0.2 * (1-x)))

Now, let's use the fact that P(A) + P(¬A) = 1, and P(B) = P(A):

P(A) + P(A|E) * P(¬A) = P(B)
x + P(A|E) * (1 - x) = 0.15

Now, we can solve the equation:

x + 0.8x - 0.8x^2 = 0.15
0.8x^2 - 1.8x + 0.15 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for x, but since x is a probability, it must be between 0 and 1. Only one solution satisfies this, which is:

x ≈ 0.45

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.45}
