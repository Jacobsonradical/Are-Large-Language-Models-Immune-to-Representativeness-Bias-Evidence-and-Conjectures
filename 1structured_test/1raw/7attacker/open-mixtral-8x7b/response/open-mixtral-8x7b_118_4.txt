To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(¬A) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
P(¬B|¬A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15
P(¬A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(¬B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, find P(¬B|¬A):
P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A)
However, we do not have P(B|¬A) directly. Instead, we have the witness's overall accuracy, which is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.245.

We can find P(B|¬A) by solving for it:
P(B|¬A) = (P(B) - P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(¬A)
P(B|¬A) = (0.245 - 0.8 * 0.15) / 0.85 ≈ 0.16

Now, we can find P(¬B|¬A):
P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - P(B|¬A) ≈ 1 - 0.16 ≈ 0.84

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.84 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.1372 / (0.1372 + 0.714)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.159
