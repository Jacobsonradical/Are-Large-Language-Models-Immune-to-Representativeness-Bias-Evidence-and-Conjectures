To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness correctly identified the height (event C) or the witness made an error (event D). 

P(B) = P(B and C) + P(B and D)
= P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D)
= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32
= 0.096 / 0.32
= 0.3

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3.
