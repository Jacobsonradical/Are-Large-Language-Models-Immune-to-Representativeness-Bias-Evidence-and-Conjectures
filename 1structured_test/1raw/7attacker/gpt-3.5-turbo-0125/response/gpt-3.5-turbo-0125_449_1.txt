{probability: 0.324, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on witness identification is 0.8*0.15 = 0.12. And since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the additional probability is 0.15. Therefore, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.15 = 0.27.}
