{probability: 0.708, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. 

We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. 

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the information)
P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.27 = 0.444

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.444.
