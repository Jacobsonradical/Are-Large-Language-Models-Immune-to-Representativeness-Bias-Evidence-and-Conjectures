{probability: 0.558, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate the estimated probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Given in the information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.22 (using the Law of Total Probability)

Therefore:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.558

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.558.
