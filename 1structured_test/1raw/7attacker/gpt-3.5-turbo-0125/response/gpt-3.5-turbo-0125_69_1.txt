{probability: 0.826, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate this estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. 

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can calculate this as:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

Using the data provided:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Plugging these values into the formula above:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 = 0.826

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.826.
