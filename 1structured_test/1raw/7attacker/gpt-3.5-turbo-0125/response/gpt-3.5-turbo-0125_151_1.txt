{probability: 0.369, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate the estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let event A be the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(A) = 0.15 (given in information b)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (from information a)
P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A) from information b)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.413.
