{probability: 0.105, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

Based on the information provided, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem by taking into account the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15%) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height (80%).
