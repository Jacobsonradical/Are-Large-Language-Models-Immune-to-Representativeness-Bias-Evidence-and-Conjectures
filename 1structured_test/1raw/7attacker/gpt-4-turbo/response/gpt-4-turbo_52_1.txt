To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \(H\) as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller",
- \(H^{c}\) as the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm",
- \(W\) as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

According to the information provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H^{c}) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness's reliability data, we know:
- \(P(W|H) = 0.8\) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall)
- \(P(W|H^{c}) = 0.2\) (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \(P(H|W)\) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

where \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|H^{c}) \times P(H^{c})
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
