To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is stated as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H \mid W)\) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185cm or taller given the witness’s identification.
- \(P(W \mid H)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185cm or taller, given that the attacker really is 185cm or taller (from the problem statement, 80% or 0.8).
- \(P(H)\) is the probability that the attacker’s height is 185cm or taller (15% of the population, or 0.15).
- \(P(W)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185cm or taller. This can occur if the attacker really is 185cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies it, or if the attacker is shorter than 185cm but the witness mistakenly identifies him as taller. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]

Where:
- \(P(W \mid H^c)\) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller when they are not (erroneously, 20% or 0.2).
- \(P(H^c)\) is the probability that the attacker’s height is shorter than 185 cm (85% of the population, or 0.85).

Putting it all together:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply this back in Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, based on the information given and the witness’s reliability:

{
  "probability": 0.4138
