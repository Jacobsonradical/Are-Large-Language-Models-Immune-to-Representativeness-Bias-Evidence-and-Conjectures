To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and their observed accuracy, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

We define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( D \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) \( = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \( = 0.85 \)

We also know the witness's accuracy:
- If the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as such (True Positive) \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \)
- If the person is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (False Positive) \( P(D | \neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} \]
where \( P(D) \) — the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller — can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | H) \times P(H) + P(D | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
