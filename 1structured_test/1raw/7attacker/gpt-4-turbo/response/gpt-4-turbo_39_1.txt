To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem enables us to update our initial estimates (the prior probabilities) using new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The prior probabilities are as follows:
- \( P(H) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 15% (0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (0.85).

The witness’s ability to identify someone’s height can be represented by:
- \( P(W|H) \), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (0.80).
- \( P(W|\neg H) \), the probability the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% (0.20). 

We need to find the posterior probability, \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Use Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, can be computed by:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute in Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately:
\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
