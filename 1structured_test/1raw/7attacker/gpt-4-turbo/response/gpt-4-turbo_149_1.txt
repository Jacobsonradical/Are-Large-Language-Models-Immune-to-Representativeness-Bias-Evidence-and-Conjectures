To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the distribution of the population's heights, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that height)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, whether they are that tall or not:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, plug these values into Bayes' formula:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
