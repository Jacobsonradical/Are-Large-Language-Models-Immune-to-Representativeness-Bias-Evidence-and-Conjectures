To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(W|H) \), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that this person is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
- \( P(W|\neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that this person is actually shorter, is 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging the numbers back into Bayes' theorem gives:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 0.414.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.414}
