To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller",
- \( W \) is the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller",
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such,
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. 

From the information provided:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time),
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.20 \) (if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time),
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \), can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) P(H^c) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, 

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.
