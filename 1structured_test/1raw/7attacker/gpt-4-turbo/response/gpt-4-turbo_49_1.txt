To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height.

From the problem:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \), the accuracy of the witness when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \), since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \), the error rate of the witness when the person is shorter than 185 cm (probability of falsely identifying someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \), as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

\( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.4138.

Therefore, the desired output format:
{probability: 0.4138}
