To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this scenario is represented as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they are indeed that height, so \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \).
- According to the cityâ€™s demographics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The witness errs in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if they are shorter, so \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (where \( \neg H \) means the attacker was shorter than 185 cm).

The prior probability \( P(\neg H) \) that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.

Using the law of total probability, we can compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.414.
