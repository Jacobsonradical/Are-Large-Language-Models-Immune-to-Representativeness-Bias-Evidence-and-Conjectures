To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population data, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) is the testimony from the witness that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \(P(A)\), the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- \(P(B|A)\), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \(P(B|A^c)\), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.2.
- \(P(A^c)\), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.

Now, calculate \(P(B)\), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is about 0.414.
