To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided by the witness who claimed that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of \( H \) given \( E \) is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

From the problem:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, is given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|H^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% or 0.2 (given as the error rate in identifying people as taller who are actually shorter).

\( P(E) \), the total probability of evidence (that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller), can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using these in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
