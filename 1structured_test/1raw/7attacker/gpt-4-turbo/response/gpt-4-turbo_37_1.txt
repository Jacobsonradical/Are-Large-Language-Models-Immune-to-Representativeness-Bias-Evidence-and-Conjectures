To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represent the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness accuracy:
- The witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
- The witness mistakenly identifies those shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(A|B) \) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, let's determine \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We can use the law of total probability here:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, based on the provided witness report and witness accuracy, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
