To solve this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which in a basic form states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(H | E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given that evidence (E) has occurred. 

For our specific problem, let's define:
- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \): The event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E | H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller (given they are actually >= 185cm), which is given as 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(E | H^c) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.20. Here, \( H^c \) denotes the complementary hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H^c) \): The probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

The overall probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller (P(E)), considering both when they are and aren't actually that tall, can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

We then use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.414 (41.4%).

Therefore, we can format the answer as required:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
