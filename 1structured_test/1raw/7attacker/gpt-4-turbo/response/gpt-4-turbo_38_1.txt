To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for an event by considering new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (or 0.15).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (or 0.85).
- \( P(W|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed that tall, is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(W|A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% (or 0.2).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To find \( P(W) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
