To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us to update our prior belief about an event based on new evidence. We'll calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) denote the evidence that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, equals 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(H^c) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.

From the witness's performance data:
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|H^c) \), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Finally, substituting back to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
