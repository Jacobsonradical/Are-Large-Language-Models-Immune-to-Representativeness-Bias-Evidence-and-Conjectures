To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population height distribution, we can use Bayesian probability. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:

- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(B | A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.2.

According to Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (\( P(A | B) \)) can be calculated by:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can compute \( P(A | B) \):
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
