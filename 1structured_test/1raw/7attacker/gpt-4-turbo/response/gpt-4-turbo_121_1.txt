To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering the information from the witness and some statistics about the general population, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the witness identified someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (Given the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identifies them as such)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.20 (Given the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies them as being 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We first calculate P(B), the total probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4137931 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is around 0.414.
