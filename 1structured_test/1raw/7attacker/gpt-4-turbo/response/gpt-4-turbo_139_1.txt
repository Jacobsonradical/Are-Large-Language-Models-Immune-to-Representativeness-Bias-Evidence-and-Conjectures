To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and base rate information, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Bayes’ theorem in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

\( P(B) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\sim A) \times P(\sim A) \]
Here:
- \( P(\sim A) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).
- \( P(B|\sim A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20% (or 0.2).

Calculation:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138.

Answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
