To solve the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the general population distribution, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) = event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) = event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know that:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15 (from the population data).
- \( P(A^c) \) = Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8 (witness's accuracy).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter = 20% = 0.2 (witness's error rate).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification under the conditions stated is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the answer formatted as requested would be:
{"probability": 0.4138}
