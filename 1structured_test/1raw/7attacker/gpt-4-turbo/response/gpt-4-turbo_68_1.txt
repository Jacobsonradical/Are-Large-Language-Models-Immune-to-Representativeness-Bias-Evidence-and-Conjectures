To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we use Bayes' Theorem. The information provided describes two probabilities:

1. The probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller, \(P(H)\):
   - \(P(H) = 15\% = 0.15\)

2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, as well as the probability of mistakenly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:
   - Witness correctly identifying 185 cm or taller, \(P(E|H)\) = 80% = 0.8
   - Witness misidentifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, \(P(E|\neg H)\) = 20% = 0.2

We need \(P(H|E)\) - the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Bayesâ€™ Theorem gives us:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \(P(E)\) (the probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is about 0.4138, or 41.38%. This can be formatted as required:

{probability: 0.4138}
