To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which can help us update the probability of the height of the attacker based on the witness's testimony. Let's define the events:

- **A** = Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- **B** = Witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information given:
- P(**A**) = 0.15 (as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬**A**, the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 

The witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
- Correctly identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, P(**B**|**A**) = 0.80 
- Incorrectly identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, P(**B**|¬**A**) = 0.20 

We are interested in finding P(**A**|**B**), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{**A**|**B**}) = \frac{P(\text{**B**|**A**}) \times P(\text{**A**})}{P(\text{**B**})} \]

P(**B**) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{**B**}) = P(\text{**B**|**A**}) \times P(\text{**A**}) + P(\text{**B**|¬**A**}) \times P(\text{¬**A**}) \]
\[ P(\text{**B**}) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{**B**}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then we substitute back into Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(\text{**A**|**B**}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{**A**|**B**}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.414.

Therefore, your answer in the specified format would be:

{"probability": 0.414}
