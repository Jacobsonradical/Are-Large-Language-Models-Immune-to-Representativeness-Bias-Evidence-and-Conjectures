To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and considering the witness's accuracy, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and expresses how our posterior beliefs should change given new evidence.

We have two pieces of information:
1. The population proportion \( P(H) \) where \( H \) is the event 'height is 185 cm or taller': \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (where \( \neg H \) is the event 'height is shorter than 185 cm').
2. The witness's accuracy, \( P(W|H) \) (probability of witness saying '185 cm or taller' given the person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80, and \( P(W|\neg H) \) (probability of witness saying '185 cm or taller' given the person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where 
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \] (total probability theorem).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|W) \) is:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s testimony and considering the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
