To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which computes the posterior probability based on prior probability and likelihoods. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- The prior \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The likelihood \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- We know the witness also incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, i.e., \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate in identifying people shorter than 185 cm as taller).
  
We also know the population prior \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We need \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification under those conditions is approximately:
\[ \{ "probability": 0.4138 \} \]
