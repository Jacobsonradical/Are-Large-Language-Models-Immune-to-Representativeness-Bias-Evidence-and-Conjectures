This problem can be handled using Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating our initial beliefs based on new evidence. Let us define:

\( H \) = The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
\( E \) = The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that height, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not, is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness makes a height error in 20% of cases and half the sample population used for testing are shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayesâ€™ theorem states that:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) is computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H)P(H) + P(E \mid H^c)P(H^c) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
