To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

From the problem statement:
1. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem is given by:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Converting this to a decimal:
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the ability of the witness, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the result is:
{probability: 0.41}
