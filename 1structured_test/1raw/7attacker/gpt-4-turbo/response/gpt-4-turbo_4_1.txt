To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (here, that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (here, an eyewitness testimony). Let's define the following:

- \( H \) is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( E \) is the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

According to the data we have:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15% of people are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\text{not } H) \), the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are, is 0.80.
- \( P(E|\text{not } H) \), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, when they are actually shorter, is 0.20.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\text{not } H) \times P(\text{not } H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.
