To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Moreover, the witness's ability to identify height correctly or incorrectly is given as:
- \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are in fact 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|A^c) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter).

Using Bayes’ theorem, we can find \( P(A|W) \), the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|A^c)P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
