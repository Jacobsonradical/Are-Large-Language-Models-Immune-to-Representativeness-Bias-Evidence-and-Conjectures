To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness:
- Correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they are indeed that tall: \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
- Incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if they are shorter: \( P(E|H^c) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) is determined using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the result in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
