To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Regarding the witness, we need to consider both correct identification and errors:

- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly reports A, i.e., attests the person is 185 cm or taller when they are).
- \( P(W|A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly reports A, i.e., attests the person is 185 cm or taller when they are not).

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138. When presented in the requested format:
