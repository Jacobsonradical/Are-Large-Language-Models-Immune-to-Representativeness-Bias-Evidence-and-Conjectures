To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability estimate of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and the new evidence is the testimony of the witness who claims the attacker is of that height range.

1. **Define prior probabilities:**
   - **P(T)** = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
   - **P(S)** = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85

2. **Define the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis:**
   - **P(E|T)** = Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given the person is 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
   - **P(E|S)** = Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given the person is shorter than 185 cm = 20% = 0.2

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

   Bayes' Theorem states that:
   \[ P(T|E) = \frac{P(E|T) \times P(T)}{P(E)} \]

   Where:
   - **P(T|E)** is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
   - **P(E)** is the probability of the witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height of the attacker.

   **P(E)** can be written as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|T) \times P(T) + P(E|S) \times P(S) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

   Substituting the values back into Bayes' formula:
   \[ P(T|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(T|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, our answer is:

{ "probability": 0.4138 }
