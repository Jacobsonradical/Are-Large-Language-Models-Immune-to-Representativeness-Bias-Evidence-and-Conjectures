To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) denote the event that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

**Given Data:**
1. \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is really 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(B | A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**Using Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.414}
