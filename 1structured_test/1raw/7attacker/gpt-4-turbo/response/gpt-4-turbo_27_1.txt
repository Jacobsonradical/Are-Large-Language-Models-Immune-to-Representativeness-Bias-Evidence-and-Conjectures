To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac {P(B \mid A) P(A)} {P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\(A\)).
- \(P(B \mid A)\) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(A \mid B)\) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).

From the information given:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B \mid A) = 0.80\) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a tall person).
- \(P(B \mid A^c)\) = 0.20 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being tall).

We also need to calculate \(P(B)\), the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
