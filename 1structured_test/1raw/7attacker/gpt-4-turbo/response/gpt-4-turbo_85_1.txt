To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which provides us with a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W \) be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The information given:
- The probability that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) \), is 15%, or 0.15.
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(A^c) \), is 85%, or 0.85.
- The witness correctly identifies a person who is actually 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|A) \), is 80%, or 0.80.
- The witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|A^c) \), is 20%, or 0.20.
  
We use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such (\( P(A|W) \)):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) P(A) + P(W|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification is approximately 0.4138.

In the specified format:
