To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (witness's testimony).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness accurately identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are actually that tall.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(E \mid H) \) (probability of witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(H) \) (the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) (probability of witness incorrectly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are shorter) = 0.20.

We also need \( P(E) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be derived from:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
