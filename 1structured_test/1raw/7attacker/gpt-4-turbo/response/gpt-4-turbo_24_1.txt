To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which helps in calculating the probability of a condition based on other known conditions. In this case, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

1. **Let H denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.**
   - We know P(H), the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.

2. **Let W denote the event that a witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.**
   - We need to calculate P(W|H) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given their height is 185 cm or taller) and P(W|¬H) (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given their height is less than 185 cm).

According to the problem:
   - The witness can correctly identify the height 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
   - Thus, P(W|H) = 0.80 (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller).
   - P(W|¬H) = 0.20 (probability witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm).

3. **Use Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

4. **Calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:**
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|¬H) P(¬H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

5. **Substitute these values into Bayes’ theorem:**
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138 \]

**Answer in desired format:**
{probability: 0.4138}
