To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (or 0.85).
- \( P(E \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall, is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter, is 20% (or 0.2).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.41.

{probability: 0.4138}
