To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

1. **Prior probability (\( P(H) \))**: The probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.

2. **Witness's accuracy**: The witness can correctly identify someoneâ€™s height (whether they are 185 cm or taller, or shorter than that) 80% of the time, and incorrectly 20% of the time. Therefore:
   - \( P(W|H) \) (probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given they are indeed that height) = 80% or 0.8.
   - \( P(W|H^c) \) (probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm) = 20% or 0.2.

3. **Calculate \( P(H|W) \)** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
   \]
   Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, computing using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|H^c) \times P(H^c)
   \]
   Where \( P(H^c) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, or 85% or 0.85.

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. Finally, compute \( P(H|W) \):
   \[
   P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification under the mentioned circumstances is approximately 0.4138.
