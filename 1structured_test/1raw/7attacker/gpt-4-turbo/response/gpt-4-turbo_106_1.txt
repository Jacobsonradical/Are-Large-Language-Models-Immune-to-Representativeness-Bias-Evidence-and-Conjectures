To analyze the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witness's reliability can be summarized as:
- \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \) (80% chance of correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually that height or taller).
- \( P(W|A^c) = 0.2 \) (20% chance of incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter).

We need to calculate \( P(A|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability a person is identified as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now substituting these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
