To solve this, we use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability, from statement "a": 0.15),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are (from statement "b": 0.8),
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (false positive, from statement "b": 0.2 since the witness made an error in 20% of cases),
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (also from the statement "a": 0.85),
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (what we need to calculate using law of total probability).

First, calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification and previous statistics, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
