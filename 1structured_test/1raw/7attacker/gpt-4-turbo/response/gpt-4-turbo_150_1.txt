To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population height distribution, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies the tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies the short people as tall 20% of the time)

We now calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
