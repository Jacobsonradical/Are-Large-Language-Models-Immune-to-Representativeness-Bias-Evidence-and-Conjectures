To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which in this case allows us to update the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the witness. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the witness's reliability, we know:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (witness is 80% correct when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

The prior probability \( P(H) \) as given is 0.15, and \( P(\neg H) \) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4138.
