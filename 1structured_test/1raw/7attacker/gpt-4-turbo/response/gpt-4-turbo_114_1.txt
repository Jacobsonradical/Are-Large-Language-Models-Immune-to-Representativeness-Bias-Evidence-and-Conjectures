To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given a witness's claim, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence, which is the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85.

The witness's accuracy is defined as:
- Witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller: 80% (true positive rate).
- Witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter as 185 cm or taller: 20% (false positive rate). 

Thus:
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability of witness correctly identifying attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of witness incorrectly identifying attacker shorter than 185 cm as being taller) = 0.2.

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Finally:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
