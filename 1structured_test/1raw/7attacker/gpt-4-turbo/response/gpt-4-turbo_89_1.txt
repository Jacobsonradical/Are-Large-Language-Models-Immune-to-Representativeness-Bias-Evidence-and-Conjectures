To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case is expressed as follows:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (overall probability, irrespective of the witness's statement).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness states that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this combines true positives and false positives).

Here's the solution step-by-step:

1. **Probability attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

2. **Probability that witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, \( P(W \mid H) \)**:
   - \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

3. **Probability of witness indicating someone is â‰¥185 cm, \( P(W) \)**:
   This includes:
   - True Positive (TP): Correctly identifying taller as taller
   - False Positive (FP): Incorrectly identifying shorter as taller

   Given that:
   - 50% are shorter and 50% are taller in the test conditions,
   
   Therefore:
   - \( P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid L) \cdot P(L) \),
   - Where \( P(W \mid L) \) is the probability of witness misidentifying a shorter person as taller (20% error for shorter individuals).
   - And \( P(L) \) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(L) = 0.85 \).

   Calculating:
   \[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Calculating \( P(H \mid W) \)**:
   \[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and ability, is approximately **0.4138**.
