To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the population data, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (what we want to calculate).
- \( P(W | H) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which incorporates both the true positives and false positives (people who are shorter but still identified as 185 cm or taller).

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Where:
- \( P(W | \neg H) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conditions and witness's statement, is about 0.414. Hence, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
