To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information available, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis H is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \) as the prior probability that the height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. We know this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm. We know this is 20% or 0.2, since the witness has a 20% error rate.
  
According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use this to find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
