To solve this, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem helps us update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) based on new evidence (likelihood) to arrive at a revised belief (posterior probability).

Here:
1. Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The prior probability, \( P(A) \), is given as 15% (0.15) because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. Let \( B \) denote the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.
4. We need to find \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall. This is stated as 80%, so \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are not that tall. According to the data, the witness errs in 20% of the cases involving people shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them so, is about 0.414.
