To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our initial beliefs (in this case, the distribution of tall and short people in the population) based on new evidence (witness's testimony). We can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- \( P(A) \) (the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \) (the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall) = 0.8.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) (the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their true height) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
     = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29
\]
Then, plugging these values back into Bayes' formula:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
           = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
           \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witnessâ€™s testimony and the population data, is approximately 0.4138.
