To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can apply Bayesian probability:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller is given as 15%, or 0.15.

2. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify someone as being 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this by considering both the true positives (correctly identifying tall people) and false positives (incorrectly identifying not-tall people as tall):
   - True positive: Probability witness correctly identifies a tall person = 80% of the time (when they are actually tall, P(E|H))
   - False positive: Probability witness incorrectly identifies a not-tall person as tall = 20% of the time (when they are not tall, P(E|¬H))
   
   Given that 15% of the population are tall (H) and 85% are not (¬H), P(E) is calculated as:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

3. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such can be calculated using Bayes' rule:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the Bayesian estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.414.
