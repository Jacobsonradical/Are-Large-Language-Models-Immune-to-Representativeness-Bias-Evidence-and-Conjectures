To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \): The witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We know the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness's accuracy is given as follows:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (80% accurate when person is 185 cm or taller)
- The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate)

We wish to find \( P(A|B) \) â€“ the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' Theorem, which states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We also need to compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.41.
