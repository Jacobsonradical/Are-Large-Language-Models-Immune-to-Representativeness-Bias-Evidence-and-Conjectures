To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

According to the provided information:
- The probability that a random individual in the population is 185 cm or taller (\( P(A) \)) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller correctly when they are indeed that tall (\( P(B|A) \)) is 80%, or 0.8.
- The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that (\( P(B|\neg A) \)), i.e., the false positive rate, is 20%, or 0.2.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substituting into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\{"probability": 0.4138\}
\]
