To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 0.2.

We want to compute \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' Theorem, this is calculated as follows:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We use the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, our answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
