To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \) (probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- \( P(\neg H) \) (probability that attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we are provided with the witness's ability to identify height:
- \( P(W|H) \) (probability witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20

We seek \( P(H|W) \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identifies them as such). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Here, \( P(W) \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of true height) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Hence, the answer is: {"probability": 0.414}
