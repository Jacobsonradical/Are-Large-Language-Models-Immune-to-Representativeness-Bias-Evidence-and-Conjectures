To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( E \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the statement:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (given they are indeed that tall) \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (given they are shorter) \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
