To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the distribution of height in the population, we use Bayes' Theorem:

Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W \) represent the event that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- \( P(\neg A) \) (prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
- \( P(W | A) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- \( P(W | \neg A) \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(W) = P(W | A) \times P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So:

\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
