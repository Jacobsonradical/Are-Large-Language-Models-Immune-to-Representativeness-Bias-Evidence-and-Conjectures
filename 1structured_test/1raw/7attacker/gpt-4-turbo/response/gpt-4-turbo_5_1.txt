To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes' theorem, which can update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence from the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the data:
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that a person in the population is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given the person is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8. 
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]

By substituting the values:
\[ 
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
\{probability: 0.4138\}
