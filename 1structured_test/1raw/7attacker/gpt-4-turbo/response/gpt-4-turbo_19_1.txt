To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is true given the evidence (witness's testimony).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the general population being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).

We also need to find \( P(E | H^c) \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not):
- \( P(E | H^c) = 0.20 \) (Since the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we calculate \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
