To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem in its general form is:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability of event A given event B occurred.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of event B given event A occurred.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

Using the information provided:
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Based on the data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, where \( A^c \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

First, calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is \( P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \).
