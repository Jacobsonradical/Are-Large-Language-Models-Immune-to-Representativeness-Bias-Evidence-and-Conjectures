To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness's reliability:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

First, calculate \( P(E) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is roughly:
{probability: 0.4138}
