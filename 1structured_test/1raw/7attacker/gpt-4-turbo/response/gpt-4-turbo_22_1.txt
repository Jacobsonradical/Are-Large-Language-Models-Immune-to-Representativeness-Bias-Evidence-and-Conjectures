To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. First, let's define:

- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represent the evidence given by the witness that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ \Pr(H | E) = \frac{\Pr(E | H) \Pr(H)}{\Pr(E)} \]

Given:
- \( \Pr(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( \Pr(E | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are)
- \( \Pr(E | H^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

We also need to calculate \( \Pr(E) \), the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller (whether true or not):
\[ \Pr(E) = \Pr(E | H) \Pr(H) + \Pr(E | H^c) \Pr(H^c) \]
\[ \Pr(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ \Pr(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ \Pr(E) = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ \Pr(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ \Pr(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \Pr(H | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
