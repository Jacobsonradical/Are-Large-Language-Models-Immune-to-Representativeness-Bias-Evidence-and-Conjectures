To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayesian probability. We have:

1. **Prior Probability (P(T))**: The prior probability that a person randomly selected from the population is 185 cm or taller is 15% (from information "a"), so P(T) = 0.15.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|T))**: This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is that tall. From information "b", we know this probability is 80% when the person is 185 cm or taller. So P(E|T) = 0.80.

3. **P(E|~T)**: This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information "b", we know this probability is 20% when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So P(E|~T) = 0.20.

4. **Marginal Probability of Evidence (P(E))**: This probability can be computed using the law of total probability:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|T) \times P(T) + P(E|~T) \times P(~T)
   \]
   Where:
   - \(P(~T)\) is the probability of being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \\
   P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \\
   P(E) = 0.29
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability (P(T|E))**: This is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:
   
   \[
   P(T|E) = \frac{P(E|T) \times P(T)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P(T|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \\
   P(T|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \\
   P(T|E) \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.4138}
