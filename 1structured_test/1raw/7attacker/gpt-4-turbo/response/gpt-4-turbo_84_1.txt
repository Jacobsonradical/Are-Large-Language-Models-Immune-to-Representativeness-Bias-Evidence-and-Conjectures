To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem combines the prior probability (initial belief before new evidence) with the likelihood of the new evidence given different scenarios.

Given:
1. Prior probability (\( P(H) \)) that a person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15.
2. Probability (\( P(L) \)) that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85.
3. Probability of witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (\( P(W|H) \)) = 80% = 0.80.
4. Probability of witness incorrectly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (\( P(W|L) \)) = 20% = 0.20.

We are asked to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which includes both false positives and correct identifications. It can be calculated by:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|L) \times P(L)
      = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
        = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
        ≈ 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that an attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.4138.
