To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' rule which takes into account both the prior distribution of heights in the population and the accuracy of the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witness:
- Correctly identifies whether someone is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- Erroneously identifies someoneâ€™s height 20% of the time. 

Thus:
- \( P(W | H) \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that height) = 0.8.
- \( P(W | H^c) \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | H^c) \times P(H^c)} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately:
