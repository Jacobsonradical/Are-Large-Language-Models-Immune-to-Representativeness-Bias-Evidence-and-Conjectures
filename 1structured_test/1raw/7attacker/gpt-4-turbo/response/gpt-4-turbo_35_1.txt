To solve this problem, we need to use the Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us to update our prior belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we need to update our belief about the attacker's height given the witness's testimony. 
Steps to solve:
1. **Define events:**
   - Let \(A\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \(W\) be the event that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Use Bayes' formula:**
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where \(P(A|W)\) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification,
   \(P(W|A)\) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller,
   \(P(A)\) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability),
   \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
  
3. **Assign values according to the description:**
   - \(P(W|A) = 0.8\) (probability witness is correct given the person is tall),
   - \(P(W|A^c) = 0.2\) (probability witness is incorrect given the person is not tall),
   - \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller),
   - \(P(A^c) = 0.85\) (85% of population is not 185 cm or taller).

4. **Calculate \(P(W)\) using the law of total probability:**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|A^c) \times P(A^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \(P(A|W)\):**
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138
   \]

In conclusion, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness testimony and population data, is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
