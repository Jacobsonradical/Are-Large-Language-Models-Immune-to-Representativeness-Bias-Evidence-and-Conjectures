To solve this, we apply Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time overall (and this probability doesnâ€™t depend on whether the person is actually taller or shorter), this value is 0.8.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can occur either when the attacker really is that tall or when they're not but the witness mistakenly claims they are.

Before calculating \( P(W) \), we breakdown it into:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
where:
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness mistakes the height 20% of the time, this value is 0.2.

So:
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
