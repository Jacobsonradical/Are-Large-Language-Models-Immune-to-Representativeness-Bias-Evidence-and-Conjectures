To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

1. Let's define our variables:
   - \( H \): Hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( E \): Evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. According to the problem:
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85 (85%).

3. The witness accuracy rates are:
   - \( P(E | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are truly 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
   - \( P(E | \neg H) \), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
