To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population data, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the data:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- \( P(A^c) \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.
- \( P(B | A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller) is 0.8.
- \( P(B | A^c) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm) is 0.2.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ 
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]
Where \( P(B) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is given by:
\[ 
P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) 
     = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29
\]

Substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
         = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
         = \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
