To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's a breakdown of how to calculate it:

Let:
H = The hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
E = The evidence that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller).
P(H^c) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witness's capability provides:
P(E|H) = 0.80 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as ≥185 cm given they are ≥185 cm).
P(E|H^c) = 0.20 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as ≥185 cm given they are <185 cm).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where P(E) (probability of the evidence) is:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H^c) * P(H^c)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Therefore, we have:
P(H|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.

Thus, the answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.41}
