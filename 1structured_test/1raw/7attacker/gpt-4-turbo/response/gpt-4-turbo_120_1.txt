To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- **H**: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- **W**: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, where \( H^c \) is the complement of \( H \))
- The witness's ability to correctly identify whether someone is 185 cm or taller or not:
  - \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are that height)
  - \( P(W | H^c) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter)

We need to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

We also need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | H^c) \times P(H^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we compute \( P(H | W) \):
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
