To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in a generic form is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall) = 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm) = 20% or 0.2.
  
We also need \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which we compute using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.
