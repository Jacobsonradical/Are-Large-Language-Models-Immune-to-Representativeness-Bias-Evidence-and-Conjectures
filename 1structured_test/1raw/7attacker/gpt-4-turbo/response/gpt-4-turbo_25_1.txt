To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in its simplest form is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the witness's identification being that the person is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time),
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time),
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm).

We also need to calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the response is:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
