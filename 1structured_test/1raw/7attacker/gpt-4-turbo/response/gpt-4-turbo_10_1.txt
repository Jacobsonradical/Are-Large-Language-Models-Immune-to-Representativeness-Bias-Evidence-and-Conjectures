To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Let:

- A be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B be the event the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so.

From the problem:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|not A) \times P(not A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Then substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so, is approximately 0.4138.

The final result would be:
