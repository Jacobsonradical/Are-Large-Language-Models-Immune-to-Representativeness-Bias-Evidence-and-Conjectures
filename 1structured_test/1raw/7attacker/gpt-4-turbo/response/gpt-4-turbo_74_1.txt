To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update an initial probability estimate (often called the prior probability) based on new evidence (the witness’s testimony in this case) to produce a more accurate probability (the posterior probability).

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% of the population)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where \( P(B) \) (probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller) can be computed by the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, using Bayes’ theorem, we compute:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s identification, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
