To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. According to this theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (H) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is true, given the evidence (E) provided by the witness.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller when the attacker really was (this is the accuracy rate of the witness when the person was actually 185 cm or taller, given as 80% or 0.80).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (15% of the population, or 0.15).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This includes both correct and incorrect identifications.

First, we compute \( P(E) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.4138.
