To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Let's define the following:

- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.85 \).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, \( P(B \mid \text{not } A) = 0.20 \) (error rate).

We want to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where \( P(B) \) can be expanded using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid \text{not } A) \times P(\text{not } A)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
