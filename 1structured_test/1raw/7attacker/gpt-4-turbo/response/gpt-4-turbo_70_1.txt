To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability estimate on the basis of new evidence.

1. **Probability Definitions**:
   - Let **A** be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let **W** be the event of the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
   - **P(A)** = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
   - **P(A^c)** = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85

   From the witness's reliability:
   - **P(W | A)** = Probability the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
   - **P(W | A^c)** = Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as tall = 20% = 0.2

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayes' theorem states that \( P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \)

   To find **P(W)**, we use the Law of Total Probability:
   - \( P(W) = P(W | A) \times P(A) + P(W | A^c) \times P(A^c) \)
   - \( P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

   Now applying Bayes' theorem:
   - \( P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \)

So, the updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4138.

Thus the output would be:

{ "probability": 0.4138 }
