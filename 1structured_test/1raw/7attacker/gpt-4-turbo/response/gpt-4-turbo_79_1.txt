To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given:
1. \( P(T) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen member of the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
2. \( P(S|T) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed that height. Here, \( P(S|T) = 0.8 \) from the information about the witness's reliability.
3. \( P(S|T^c) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter than this height. According to the witness's accuracy, \( P(S|T^c) = 0.2 \).
4. \( P(T^c) \) is the probability a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \).

We want to find \( P(T|S) \), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(T|S) = \frac{P(S|T) P(T)}{P(S|T) P(T) + P(S|T^c) P(T^c)}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(T|S) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85}
= \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
= \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138. In the specified format:
