To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H indicate the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let W indicate that the witness identified the person as being 185 cm or taller. We want to compute the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the hypothesis H is true given the witness's testimony W.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of H) is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80â€“given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether this is true or not.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
where:
- \( H^c \) is the complement of H (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) with probability \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population).
- \( P(W|H^c) \) (probability of a false positive, i.e., the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not) is 0.20.

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back in Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
