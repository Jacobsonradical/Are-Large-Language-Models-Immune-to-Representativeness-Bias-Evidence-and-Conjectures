To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context allows us to update the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witnessâ€™s testimony. 

We know the following:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(T|H) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(H|T) \), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness testified they were 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|T) = \frac{P(T|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(T)} \]

Where \( P(T) \) is the total probability of the witness testifying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Applying the law of total probability:
\[ P(T) = P(T|H) \cdot P(H) + P(T|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(T) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|T) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, based on the witness testimony and the Bayesian update, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is ~0.4138.
