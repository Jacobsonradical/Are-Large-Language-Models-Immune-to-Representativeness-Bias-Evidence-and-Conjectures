To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we will utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is stated as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represents the evidence, which is the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \), which is what we want to find.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall. According to the information given, this value is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the population distribution.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
where \( H^c \) is the complement of \( H \) (attacker shorter than 185 cm):
- \( P(H^c) \) = 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) is the probability of incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is also 20% or 0.2 as per the witness's error rate.

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414. In the specified format:
