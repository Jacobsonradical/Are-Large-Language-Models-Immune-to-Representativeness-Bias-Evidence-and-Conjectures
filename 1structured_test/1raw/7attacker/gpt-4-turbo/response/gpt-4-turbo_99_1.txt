To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let's define:

- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, which is 20% or 0.2.

We are asked to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayesian theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, computed by total law of probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S)
\]
Substitute the numbers:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Finally, calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Answer: {probability: 0.414}
