To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W | A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we calculate it as follows:
- \( P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \),
  where \( A^c \) is the probability that the person is shorter than 185 cm.
- From the problem, \( P(A^c) = 85% \) or 0.85.
- \( P(W | A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population data, is approximately:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
