To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the city's height distribution, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence provided by the witness that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness:
- Correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they are indeed that tall. So, \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).
- Incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if they are not that tall. So, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \), the probability of the evidence being observed, is given by:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting the values we calculated back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
