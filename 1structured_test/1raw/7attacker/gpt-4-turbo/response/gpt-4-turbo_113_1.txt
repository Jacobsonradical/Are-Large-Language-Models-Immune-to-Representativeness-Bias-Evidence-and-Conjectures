To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information from a witness, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem enables us to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's testimony).

Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( E \) be the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: This is initially given as 15% of the population being 185 cm or taller.
    
    \( P(H) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood of Evidence given the Hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \))**: If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identifies this is 80%. 
    
    \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)

3. **Probability of the Evidence (\( P(E) \))**: This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
   \]
   
   Where:
   - \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not. The error rate is 20%, so:
     
     \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \)

   Plugging in the values:
   
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability (\( P(H|E) \))** using Bayes' Theorem:

    \[
    P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
    \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
