To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Rule, which mathematically describes how to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given evidence. Let's define:

- \(A\) as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \(W\) as the event "the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller."

We know:
- \(P(A)\), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(A^c)\), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \(P(W|A)\), the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
- \(P(W|A^c)\), the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.

We want to find \(P(A|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Rule states that:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we calculate \(P(W)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|A^c)P(A^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, using Bayes' Rule:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

In the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
