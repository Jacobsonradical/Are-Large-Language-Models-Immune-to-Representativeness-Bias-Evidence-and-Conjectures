To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities and marginal probabilities of random events. We need to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | H^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \) we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
