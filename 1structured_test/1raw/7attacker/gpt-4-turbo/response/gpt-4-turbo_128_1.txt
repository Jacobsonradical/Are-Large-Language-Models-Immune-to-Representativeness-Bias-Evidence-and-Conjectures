To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the logic step-by-step:

Let $H$ be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and $E$ be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

1. **Prior Probability** ($P(H)$): This is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller without considering the witness's testimony.
   - According to the data, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, $P(H) = 0.15$.

2. **Witness Accuracy**:
   - The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Thus, if the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness identifies them as such is $P(E|H) = 0.80$.
   - The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Thus, if the person is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness still identifies them as 185 cm or taller is $P(E|H^c) = 0.20$.

3. **Marginal Probability of Witness's Evidence** ($P(E)$): This is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, combining both correct and incorrect identifications.
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c)
   = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29
   \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem** to find $P(H|E)$ (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification):
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
   = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
