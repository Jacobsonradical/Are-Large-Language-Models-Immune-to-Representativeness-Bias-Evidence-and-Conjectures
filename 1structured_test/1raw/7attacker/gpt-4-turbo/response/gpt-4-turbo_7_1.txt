To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem calculates the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller) given certain evidence (the witness identification in this particular setting).

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence, that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg H) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter).

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]
