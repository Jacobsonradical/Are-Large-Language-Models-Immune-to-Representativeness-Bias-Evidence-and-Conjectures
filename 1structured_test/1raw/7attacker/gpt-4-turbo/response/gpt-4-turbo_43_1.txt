To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15 from data).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability of the witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker’s actual height.

From the information:
- \( P(W \mid H) \) = 80% (since the witness correctly identified those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time according to the trials) = 0.8
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. This equals 20% error rate on those shorter than 185 cm = 0.2
- \( P(H^c) \) = 85% or 0.85 (the probability a person is shorter than 185 cm).

Then, \( P(W) \) can be calculated using:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Using these values in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) ≈ 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and error rates of witness identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
