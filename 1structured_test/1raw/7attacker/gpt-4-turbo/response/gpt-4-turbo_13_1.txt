To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities and marginal probabilities of events, and is stated as:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let:
- \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) denote the event that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not; \( A^c \) is the complementary event where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (\( P(B) \)) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

The answer is:
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
