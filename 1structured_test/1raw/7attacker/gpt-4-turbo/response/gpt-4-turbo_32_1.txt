To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represent the evidence (witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability, as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness's reliability, we know:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability of correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability of incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as taller).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \) occurring, calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is about 0.414.

Formatted to meet your requirement, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
