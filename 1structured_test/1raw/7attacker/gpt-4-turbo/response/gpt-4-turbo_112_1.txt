To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

1. Define the initial probabilities:
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   
   According to the information provided:
   - \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15.
   - \( P(A^c) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85.

2. Assess witness reliability (likelihoods):
   - \( P(B | A) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8.
   - \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 20% = 0.2.

3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
   - Bayes' Theorem states \( P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \).
   - We need \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85).
     \]
     Calculating \( P(B) \):
     \[
     P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
     \]

4. Finally, calculate \( P(A | B) \):
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138.
   \]

Converting this to a more comprehensible format:

{
  "probability": 0.4138
}

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
