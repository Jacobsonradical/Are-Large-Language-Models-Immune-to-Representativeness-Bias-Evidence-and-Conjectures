To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both the witness's report and the distribution of heights in the population, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence or event described, namely that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (the general likelihood of \( H \) before the new evidence \( E \)), which we know is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of \( E \), which is computed using the Law of Total Probability.

### Calculations:

1. **Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller** (\( P(E \mid H) \)):
   Given that the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time, \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \).

2. **Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller** (\( P(E \mid \neg H) \)): 
   Given that the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \).

3. **Total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller** (\( P(E) \)):
   \[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(H \mid E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and population statistics, is about 0.4138.
