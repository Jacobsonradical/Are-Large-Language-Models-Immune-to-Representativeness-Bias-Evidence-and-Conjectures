To solve this problem, let's define:

- The probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is 15%, or 0.15.
- The probability that a randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) \), is 85%, or 0.85.

From the witness's accuracy:
- Would correctly identify someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(E|H) \), is 80%, or 0.80.
- Would erroneously identify someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, \( P(E|\neg H) \), is 20%, or 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement can be calculated as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85}
       = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
       = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
       = 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
