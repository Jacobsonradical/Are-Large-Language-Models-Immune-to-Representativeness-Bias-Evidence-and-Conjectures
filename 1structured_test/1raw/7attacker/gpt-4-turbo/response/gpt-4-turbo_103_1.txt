To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, let's define the following:
- Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is computed as follows:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller and can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, computing \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Representing this as a probability between 0 and 1:
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
