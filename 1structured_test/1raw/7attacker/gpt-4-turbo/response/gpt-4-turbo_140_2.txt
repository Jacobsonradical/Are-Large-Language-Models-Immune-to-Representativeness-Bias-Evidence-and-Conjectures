To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the general height distribution in the city, we employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in updating an initial or prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \), the complement of the event \( A \) (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that height, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% or 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
