To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps in updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here is how we proceed:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This is the initial probability of the hypothesis (attacker being 185 cm or taller) before witnessing any new evidence. According to the data: 
   \[
   P(H) = 0.15 
   \]
   because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Evidence (E)**: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

3. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true. The witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time correctly when they are indeed 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

4. **Probability of Evidence (P(E))**: This is the overall probability of the witness claiming the person is 185 or taller, which can be true or false identification. We calculate it using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c)
   \]
   where \( P(E|H^c) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is false (i.e., the witness mistakenly identifying someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller). From the information given, the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time:
   \[
   P(E|H^c) = 0.20
   \]
   and 
   \[
   P(H^c) = 0.85
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Updated Probability of Hypothesis (Posterior Probability, P(H|E))**:
   Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the ability to judge height, is approximately 0.4138.
