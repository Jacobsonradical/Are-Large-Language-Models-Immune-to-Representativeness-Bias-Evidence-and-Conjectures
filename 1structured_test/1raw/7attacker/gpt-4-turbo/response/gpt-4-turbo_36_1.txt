To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and information about the height distribution in the population, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \(H\) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\), the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E \mid H) = 0.8\), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2\), the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter.

We seek \(P(H \mid E)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.414. In the requested format:
