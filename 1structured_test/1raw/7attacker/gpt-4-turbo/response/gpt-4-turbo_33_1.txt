To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the statistics about the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, let:
- \( A \) represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller) = 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm) = 20% or 0.2.

Next, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
