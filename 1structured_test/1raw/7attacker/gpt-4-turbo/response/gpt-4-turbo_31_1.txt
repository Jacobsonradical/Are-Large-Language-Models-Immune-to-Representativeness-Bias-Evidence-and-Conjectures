To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem. The theorem will help us update our probability estimate for the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( W \) be the event that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall or taller, is 80% or 0.8. 
- \( P(W|H^c) \), the probability that the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., less than 185 cm), is 20% or 0.2, since the witness is wrong in 20% of the total judgments.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|H^c) P(H^c) \]

Now, calculating \( P(H^c) \), the probability a person is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

Calculating \( P(W) \), the total probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using these probabilities in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
