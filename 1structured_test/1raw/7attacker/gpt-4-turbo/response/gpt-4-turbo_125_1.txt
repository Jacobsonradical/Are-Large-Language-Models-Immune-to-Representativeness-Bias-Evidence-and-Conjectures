We need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and population statistics. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( A \) and the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as \( W \).

We are provided with the following probabilities:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \), which is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- The probability \( P(W|A) \), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
- The probability \( P(W|\neg A) \), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not, is 0.2.

We want to calculate \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We use Bayes' Theorem for this:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
