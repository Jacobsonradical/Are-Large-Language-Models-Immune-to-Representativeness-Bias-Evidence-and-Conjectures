Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{not } H) = 0.85 \) since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- The witness correctly identifies people 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This translates to:
  - \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are)
  - \( P(W | \text{not } H) = 0.20 \) (Probability the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are not)
  
We need to find \( P(H | W) \) - the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can calculate this using Bayesâ€™ rule:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) can be estimated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | \text{not } H) P(\text{not } H)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Substituting in Bayes' rule, we find:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is approximately 0.4138.
