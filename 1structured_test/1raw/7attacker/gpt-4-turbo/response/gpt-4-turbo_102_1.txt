To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our probability estimates based on the given evidence. Let's define the following:

\( H \) = attacker is 185 cm or taller
\( \neg H \) = attacker is shorter than 185 cm
\( W \) = witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller

According to the problem, the probabilities are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) ("15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller")
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) ("85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm")
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) ("Witness correctly identified people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time")
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) ("Witness erred by identifying people shorter than 185 cm as taller in 20% of the cases")

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) 
     = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) 
     = 0.12 + 0.17 
     = 0.29
\]

Substituting these into Bayes' formula gives:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.
