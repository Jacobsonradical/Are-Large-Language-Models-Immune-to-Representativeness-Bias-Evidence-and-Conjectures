To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (or 0.15).
- \( P(\overline{H}) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (or 0.85).
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(E|\overline{H}) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 20% (or 0.2).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H})
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

This is represented in the requested format as:
{probability: 0.414}
