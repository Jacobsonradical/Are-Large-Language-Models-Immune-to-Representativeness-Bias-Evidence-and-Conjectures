To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( H \) for "height" and \( W \) for "witness"):

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where: 
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that this is true. As given, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so this probability is 0.80.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the individual is 185 cm or taller. This is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]

where:
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(W|H^c) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.20 (since the witness makes a mistake in 20% of cases).

Calculating \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
