To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identified those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identified those shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We seek \( P(A \mid B) \), or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, based on the information provided and using the witness's accuracy and population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

The answer in the specified format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
