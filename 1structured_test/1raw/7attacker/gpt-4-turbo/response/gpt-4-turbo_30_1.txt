To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population height data, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability (the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability (the probability of being 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood (the probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time),
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (witness mistakenly identifies someone below 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, where \( A^c \) indicates being shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Using these, we evaluate \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the demographic data, is approximately 0.414.
