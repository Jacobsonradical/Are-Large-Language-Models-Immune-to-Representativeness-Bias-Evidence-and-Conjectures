To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15%).
- \( P(W|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the conditions given, the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases, so \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This includes both cases where the witness is correct and when the witness is incorrect. We compute \( P(W) \) as follows:
  - \( P(W|A) \) (the witness is correct about tall people) = 0.80
  - \( P(W|B) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter. Since 20% of the time the witness errs, \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \).
  - \( P(B) \) is the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
  
Thus, \( P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|B) \times P(B) \)

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Expressed as a probability:
{probability: 0.4138}
