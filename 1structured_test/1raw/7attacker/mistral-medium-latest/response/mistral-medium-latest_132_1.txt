To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information.

First, let's use Bayes' theorem to combine the witness's accuracy with the base rate of people's heights in the city.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B).

Given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness's inaccuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (base rate of people being shorter than 185 cm in the city)

First, find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
     = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
