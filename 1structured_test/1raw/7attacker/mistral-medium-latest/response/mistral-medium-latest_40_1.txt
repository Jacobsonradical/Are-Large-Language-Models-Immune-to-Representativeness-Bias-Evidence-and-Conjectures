To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W), which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)

Since P(W and H) = P(W|H) \* P(H), and P(not H) = 1 - P(H), we can rewrite the above equation as:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We are given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying shorter people, so P(W|not H) = 0.2. Plugging in the known values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.24

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.24 ≈ 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5 or 50%.
