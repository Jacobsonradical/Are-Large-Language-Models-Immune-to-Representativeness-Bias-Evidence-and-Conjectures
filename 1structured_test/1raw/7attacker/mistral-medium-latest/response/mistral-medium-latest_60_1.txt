To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities. The theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually were 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they actually were shorter than 185 cm)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

We can use these probabilities to calculate P(B), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.
