To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information given:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not tall, we have:

P(W|not H) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3855

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3855.
