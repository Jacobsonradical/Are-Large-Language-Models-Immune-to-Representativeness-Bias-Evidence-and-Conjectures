To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of tall people in the population (85% shorter, 15% 185 cm or taller) and the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions (80% correct, 20% error).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability P(T|W), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (T) given the witness's testimony (W). The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|S) \* P(S)]

Where:
P(T) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(S) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W|T) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person = 0.80
P(W|S) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall = 0.20

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

P(T|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.395
