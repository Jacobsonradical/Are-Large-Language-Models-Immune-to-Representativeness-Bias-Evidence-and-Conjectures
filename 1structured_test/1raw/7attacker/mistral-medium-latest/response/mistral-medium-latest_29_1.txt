To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~A) = 0.85 (from information b)
P(W|A) = 1.0 (since the witness always correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (from information a)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|W) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.429.
