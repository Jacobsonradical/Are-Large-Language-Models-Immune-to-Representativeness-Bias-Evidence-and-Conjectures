To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let:

A = "The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
B = "The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"

We are given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height, we can use:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents the complementary event "The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm". We are given:

P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

And we know:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138
