To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the problem statement, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.3873

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3873.
