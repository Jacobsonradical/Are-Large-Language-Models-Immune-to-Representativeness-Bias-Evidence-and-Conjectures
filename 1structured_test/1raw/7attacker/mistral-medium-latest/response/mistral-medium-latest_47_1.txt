To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know:

P(A) = 0.15 (from statement a)

P(B|A) = 0.80 (from statement b, the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We also need P(B|¬A), which represents the probability of the witness identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller. From statement b, we know this to be 0.20.

Since P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A), we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.467.
