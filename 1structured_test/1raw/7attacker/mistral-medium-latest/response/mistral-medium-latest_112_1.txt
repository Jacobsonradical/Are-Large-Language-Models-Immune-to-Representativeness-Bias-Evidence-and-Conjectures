To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

* P(T) as the prior probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller (from information a).
* P(S|T) as the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller (from information b).
* P(~S|~T) as the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (from information b).
* P(S) as the prior probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their true height.

Our goal is to find P(T|S), the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) / P(S)

We are given:

* P(T) = 0.15
* P(S|T) = 0.80
* P(~S|~T) = 0.80

To find P(S), we can use the law of total probability:

P(S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|~T) \* P(~T)

Since P(~T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 and P(S|~T) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, we have P(S|~T) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(S):

P(S) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the posterior probability P(T|S):

P(T|S) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
