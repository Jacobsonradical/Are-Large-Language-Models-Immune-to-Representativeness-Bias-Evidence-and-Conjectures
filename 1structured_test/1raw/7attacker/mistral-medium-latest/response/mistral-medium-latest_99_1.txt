To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to incorporate both pieces of information given. This involves combining prior probabilities (information a) and the witness's accuracy (information b).

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information a.
P(B|A) as the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information b.
P(B|¬A) as the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on information b.
P(¬A) as the probability the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 based on information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3947

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3947.
