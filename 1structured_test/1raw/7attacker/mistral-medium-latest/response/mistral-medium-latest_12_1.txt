To calculate the estimated probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, we have:
P(W|H) = 0.8

When the witness is presented with someone who is not 185 cm or taller, they still identify them as such 20% of the time:
P(W|~H) = 0.2

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Substituting the values:
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255

Now we can calculate P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

{probability: 0.467}
