To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W). By Bayes' theorem,

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witness's errors occur when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(W|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
