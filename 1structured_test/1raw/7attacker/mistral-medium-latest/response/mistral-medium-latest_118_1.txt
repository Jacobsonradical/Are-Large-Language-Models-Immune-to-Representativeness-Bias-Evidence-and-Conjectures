To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a) and (b). Here's how we can calculate it:

1. First, let's determine the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution (information b). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, our prior probability is 0.15.
2. Next, let's consider the witness's testimony (information a). The witness has an 80% accuracy rate when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. However, this accuracy rate is biased towards the witness's overall performance, which includes cases where the person is shorter than 185 cm. We need to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person, given that the person is actually tall.
3. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(Witness). In this case:

   - P(Tall | Witness) is the probability that the attacker is tall, given the witness's testimony.
   - P(Witness | Tall) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall, which is 0.80 (80% accuracy).
   - P(Tall) is the prior probability of the attacker being tall, which we determined to be 0.15.
   - P(Witness) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as tall, regardless of their actual height. We can calculate this as the weighted average of the witness's accuracy rates: P(Witness) = P(Witness and Tall) + P(Witness and Not Tall) = P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness | Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall). We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not tall, so P(Witness | Not Tall) = 0.20. Plugging in our values, we get P(Witness) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.255.
4. Now we can calculate P(Tall | Witness) using Bayes' theorem: P(Tall | Witness) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.467.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.467.
