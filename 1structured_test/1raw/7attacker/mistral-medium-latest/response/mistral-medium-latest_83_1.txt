To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the given information:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3636

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is about 0.3636.
