To solve this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A): 15% or 0.15 (from information "a")
2. P(B|A): 80% or 0.80 (from information "b")

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, irrespective of their actual height. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

Since P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A), and P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A), we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.80 and P(A) = 0.15.
We also know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
The only unknown left is P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|not A) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
