To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of a random person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).

P(W|T) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information a).

P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from information a).

P(F) as the prior probability of a random person from the city being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from information b).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(T|W) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.383

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.383.
