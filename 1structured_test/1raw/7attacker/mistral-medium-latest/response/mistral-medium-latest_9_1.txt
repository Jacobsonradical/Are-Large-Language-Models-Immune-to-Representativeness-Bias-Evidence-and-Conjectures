To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the given information:

a) P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
b) P(W|not H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
c) P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
d) P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.444 or 44.4%

But we want the probability as a number between 0 and 1, so we will divide by 100.

probability: 0.444
