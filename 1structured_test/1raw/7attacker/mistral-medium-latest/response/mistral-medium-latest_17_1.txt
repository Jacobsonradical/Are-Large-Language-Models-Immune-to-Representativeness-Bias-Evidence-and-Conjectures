To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from information b).
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
