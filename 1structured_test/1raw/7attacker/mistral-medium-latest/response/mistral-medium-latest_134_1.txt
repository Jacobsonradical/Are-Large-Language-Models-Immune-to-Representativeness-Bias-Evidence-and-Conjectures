To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information from the witness's accuracy and the population distribution. We can do this using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We still need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
        = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)
        = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
           = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
