To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller (true height).
P(F) as the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm (false height).
P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we have:

P(T) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(F) = 0.85
P(W|T) = 0.80 (from statement b)
P(W|F) = 0.20

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.3855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3855.

{probability: 0.3855}
