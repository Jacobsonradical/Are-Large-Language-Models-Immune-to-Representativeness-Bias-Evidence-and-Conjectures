To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the witness's testimony as W. We want to compute the posterior probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

where ~H denotes the complementary event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
* P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information a)
* P(W|~H) = 0.2 (from information a)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.42

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.42.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.42}
