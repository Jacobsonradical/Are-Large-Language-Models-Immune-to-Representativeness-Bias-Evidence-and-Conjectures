To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let event A represent "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and let event B represent "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Now we need to find the probabilities P(A), P(B|A), and P(B).

1. P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on the population distribution). According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15.
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's accuracy, P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We need to find this probability using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm." According to the information provided, P(¬A) = 0.85. We also need P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Based on the witness's accuracy, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138
