To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')]

From the information provided:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B|A) = 1.0 (if the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such)

P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.423
