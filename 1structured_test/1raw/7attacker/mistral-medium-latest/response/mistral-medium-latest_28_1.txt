To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here are the given probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Now, calculate P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm).

Substitute the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.367

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.367.
