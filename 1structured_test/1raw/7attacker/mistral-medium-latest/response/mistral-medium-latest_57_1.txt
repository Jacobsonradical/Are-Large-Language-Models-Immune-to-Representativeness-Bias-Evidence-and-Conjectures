To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two factors: the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of heights in the city.

First, let's determine the probability of the witness correctly identifying an individual who is 185 cm or taller. Based on the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying such a person when they see one. Therefore, P(Correct Identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

Next, let's consider the base rate of individuals in the city who are 185 cm or taller. According to the data, 15% of the population falls into this category. So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct Identification) = [P(Correct Identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Correct Identification)

Since the witness can either correctly or incorrectly identify a person's height, their overall accuracy is the sum of their correct and incorrect identifications: P(Correct Identification) = 0.8 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.8) = 0.8 + 0.04 = 0.84.

Now we can plug in the values:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct Identification) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.14285714

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.143.
