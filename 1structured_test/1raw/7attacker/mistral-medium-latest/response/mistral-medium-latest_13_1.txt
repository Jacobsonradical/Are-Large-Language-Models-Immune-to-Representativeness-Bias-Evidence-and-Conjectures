To determine the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
A: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states: P(H|A) = [P(A|H) \* P(H)] / P(A)

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A|H) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)

We still need to find P(A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height.

P(A) = P(A and H) + P(A and not H)
     = P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|not H) \* P(not H)
     = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (probability of witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller \* 0.85)

We are given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when judging height. Since half of the sample in the assessment is shorter than 185 cm, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% / 2 = 10% of the time.

So, P(A|not H) = 0.10, and we can now calculate P(A):

P(A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.10 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Now we can find P(H|A):

P(H|A) = (P(A|H) \* P(H)) / P(A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.5854

{probability: 0.5854}
