To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, let's find P(H) and P(W|H). From information (b), P(H) = 0.15, and since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller (from information (a)), P(W|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(W|¬H), which represents the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (from information (a) and (b)), P(W|¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.2 = 0.04.

Now, we can find P(¬H), which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information (b), P(¬H) = 0.85.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.04 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression above, we get:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.78

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.78}
