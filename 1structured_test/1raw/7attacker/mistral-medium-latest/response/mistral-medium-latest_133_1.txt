To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

First, let's find P(H), the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From information b, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, let's find P(W|H), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From information a, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8.

Now, we need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. We can find this by using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)
     = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We already have P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15. We also know that P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. From information a, we know that the witness errs in identifying height 20% of the time, so P(W|not H) = 0.2 when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.467.
