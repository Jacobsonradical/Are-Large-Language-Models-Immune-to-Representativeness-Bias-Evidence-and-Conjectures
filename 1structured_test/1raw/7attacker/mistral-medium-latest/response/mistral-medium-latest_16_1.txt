First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy. They correctly identify the height of a person 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case:

Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We know the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3889

Therefore, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3889 or 38.89%.
