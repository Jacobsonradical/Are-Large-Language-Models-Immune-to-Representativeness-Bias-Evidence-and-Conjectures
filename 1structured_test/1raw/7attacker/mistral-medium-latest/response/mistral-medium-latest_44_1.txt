To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(B|A') is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm.

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Substituting the values:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
