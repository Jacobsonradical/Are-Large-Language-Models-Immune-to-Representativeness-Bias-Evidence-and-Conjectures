To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From information (a), P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
From information (b), P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We still need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)
= P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (probability of witness saying tall when the person is not tall \* 0.85)

From information (a), the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not tall, so P(W|not H) = 0.2. Substituting the values:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
