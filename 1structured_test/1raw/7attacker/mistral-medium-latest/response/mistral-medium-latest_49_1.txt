To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:

A = The attacker was 185 cm or taller
B = The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A) = The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8
2. P(A) = The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution = 0.15 (from information b)
3. P(B) = The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we need P(B|not A) and P(not A).

P(not A) = The probability that an attacker is not 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution = 0.85 (from information b)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a person's height:

P(B|not A) = The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller = 0.2

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
