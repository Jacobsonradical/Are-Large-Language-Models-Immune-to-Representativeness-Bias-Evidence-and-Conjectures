To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, the event we're interested in is the attacker being 185 cm or taller (denoted as A), and the evidence is the witness's testimony (denoted as W). Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

First, we need to find the prior probabilities (P(A) and P(¬A)) and the likelihoods (P(W|A) and P(W|¬A)). From the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of the witness identifying a short person as tall is:

P(W|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4286

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4286.
