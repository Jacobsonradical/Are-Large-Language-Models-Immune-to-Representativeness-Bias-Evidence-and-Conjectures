To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From information a, we know that:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height when the person is 185 cm or taller)

From information b, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W|¬H) and P(¬H) to calculate P(W).

P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability is: {probability: 0.4138}
