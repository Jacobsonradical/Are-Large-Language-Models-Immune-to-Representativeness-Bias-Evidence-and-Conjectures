To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A): The probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.

We need to find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Since P(not A) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, it is 85% or 0.85. Also, P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are, in fact, shorter than 185 cm. This is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
    = 0.12 + 0.17
    = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.38

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.38.
