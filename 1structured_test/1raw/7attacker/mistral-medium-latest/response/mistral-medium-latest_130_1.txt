To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(S) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(~S) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:

P(T) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(S|T) = 1.0 (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such, since they are correct 80% of the time and there is no chance of them incorrectly identifying a tall person as short when half the people are short and half are tall)
P(S|~T) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
P(~T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 (from information a)
P(~S|T) = 0 (since P(S|T) = 1.0)
P(~S|~T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a short person as short 80% of the time)

Now we can find P(S):

P(S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|~T) \* P(~T) = 1.0 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(T|S):

P(T|S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) / P(S) = 1.0 \* 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875
