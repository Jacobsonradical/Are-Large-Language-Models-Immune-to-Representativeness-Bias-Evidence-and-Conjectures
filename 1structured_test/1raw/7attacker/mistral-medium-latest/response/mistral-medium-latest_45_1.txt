To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H for the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W for the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

Given the information provided:

- P(H): The probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- P(W|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the height when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.

We still need to find P(W), the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can find it using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

where H' is the complementary event, i.e., the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller:

- P(W|H'): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height when the person is shorter than 185 cm is 20% or 0.2.
- P(H'): The probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
