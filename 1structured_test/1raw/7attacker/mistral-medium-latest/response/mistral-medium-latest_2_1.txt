To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information given, we know that:

- P(H): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(¬H): probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- P(W|H): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(W|¬H): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(H|W) ≈ 0.4286

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is around 0.4286.

{probability: 0.4286}
