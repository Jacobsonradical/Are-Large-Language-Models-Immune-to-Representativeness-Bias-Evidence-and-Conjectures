To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we want to find)
- P(S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(T|S) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says they are

From the given information, we know:
P(T) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(~T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85

Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we have:
P(S|T) = 0.80 (the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, given that they are)
P(S|~T) = 0.20 (the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(T|S):

P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / [P(S|T) * P(T) + P(S|~T) * P(~T)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|S) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3659

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3659.
