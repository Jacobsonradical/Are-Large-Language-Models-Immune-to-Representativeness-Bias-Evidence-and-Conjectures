To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a)
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller (from information b)
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller (from information b)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from information b)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from information b)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
