To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:
H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|~H) = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) = [0.12] / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

So the answer is: {probability: 0.4138}
