To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two probabilities: the witness's accuracy and the population distribution.

1. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are 185 cm or taller. However, they also incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm.
2. Population distribution: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

To find the estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says they are) = (P(Witness says they are | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness says they are)

We know that:
P(Witness says they are | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

However, we don't know P(Witness says they are). To find it, we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness says they are) = P(Witness says they are | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says they are | Attacker is shorter) \* P(Attacker is shorter)

We know that:
P(Attacker is shorter) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85
P(Witness says they are | Attacker is shorter) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the attacker is shorter)

So,
P(Witness says they are) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says they are) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
