To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (from b)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A') = 0.85 (from a)

P(B|A') = 0.2 (from b)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, plugging in these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
