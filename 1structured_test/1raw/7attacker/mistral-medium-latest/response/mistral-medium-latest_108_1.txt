To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

P(A) as the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city (a priori probability), which is 0.15 according to information (a).

P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information (b).

P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information (b).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we find that:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.36.

The answer is: {probability: 0.36}
