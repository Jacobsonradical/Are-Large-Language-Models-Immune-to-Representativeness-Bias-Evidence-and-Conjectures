To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the posterior probability based on prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (from the information in point b)
P(¬H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 1.0 (the witness has 100% accuracy when identifying tall people)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Now we can plug in the given values:

P(H|W) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.4167

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4167.
