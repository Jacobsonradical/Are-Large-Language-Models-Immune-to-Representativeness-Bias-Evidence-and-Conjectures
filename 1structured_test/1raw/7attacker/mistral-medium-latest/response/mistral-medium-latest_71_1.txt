To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the witness's identification as E. We want to find the probability of H given E, denoted as P(H|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:

* P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.
* P(H) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 in the problem.
* P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.2 in the problem.
* P(~H) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.85 in the problem.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4063

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4063.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.4063}
