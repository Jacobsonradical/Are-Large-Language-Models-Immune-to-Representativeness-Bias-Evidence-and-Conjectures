To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where H is the hypothesis "The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," E is the evidence "The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller," P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(not H) is the prior probability of not H, P(E|H) is the likelihood of E given H, and P(E|not H) is the likelihood of E given not H.

From the given information, we can identify the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
* P(not H) = 0.85 (from information b)
* P(E|H) = 0.80 (from information a)
* P(E|not H) = 0.20 (from information a)

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.357.
