To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not H) = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3889

{probability: 0.3889}
