To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from statement b, the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from statement b, the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from statement a)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we obtain:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.375.
