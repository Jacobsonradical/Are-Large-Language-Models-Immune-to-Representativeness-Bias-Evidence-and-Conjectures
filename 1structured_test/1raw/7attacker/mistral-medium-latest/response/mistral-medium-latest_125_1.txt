To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time, from statement b)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, and P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

We also need to find P(W|¬H), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall. From statement b, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
