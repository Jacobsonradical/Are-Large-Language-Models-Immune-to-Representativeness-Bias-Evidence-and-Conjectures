To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and
P(W|T) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

From information (a), we know that P(W|T) = 0.8.

Now we also need to find P(W|F), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when judging height, P(W|F) = 0.2.

Next, let's find the prior probabilities using information (b):
P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = [P(W|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.427

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.427.
