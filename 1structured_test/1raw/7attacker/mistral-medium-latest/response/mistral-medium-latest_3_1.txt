To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall|Witness) = P(Witness|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We are given:
P(Tall) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(Witness|Tall) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(Witness|Not Tall) = 0.2 (from information b)

We need to calculate P(Witness), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height:

P(Witness) = P(Witness|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness|Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)

P(Not Tall) = 1 - P(Tall) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(Tall|Witness):

P(Tall|Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
