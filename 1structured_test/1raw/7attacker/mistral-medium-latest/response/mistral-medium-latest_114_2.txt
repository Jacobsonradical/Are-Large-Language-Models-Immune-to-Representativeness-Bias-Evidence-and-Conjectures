To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(Tall) be the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, and P(Short) = 1 - P(Tall) be the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
P(Tall) = 0.15
P(Short) = 0.85

Let E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given that:
P(E | Tall) = 1.0 (the witness always correctly identifies tall people as tall)
P(E | Short) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Tall | E) = P(E | Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(E | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(E | Short) \* P(Short)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Tall | E) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.15 / [0.15 + 0.17]
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.46875.
