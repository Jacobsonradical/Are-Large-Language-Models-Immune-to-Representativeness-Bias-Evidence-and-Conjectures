To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / [P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|¬H) * P(¬H)]

From the given information:

P(H) = 15% = 0.15 (from information a)
P(¬H) = 85% = 0.85

Since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time:
P(W|H) = 0.80

When the witness makes an error, it means they identify a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Since half of the people in the sample used to assess the witness's ability are shorter than 185 cm:
P(W|¬H) = 0.20 * (1/2) = 0.10

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.10 * 0.85)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.3855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3855.
