To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two probabilities: the baseline probability of a person's height being 185 cm or taller (from information a), and the witness's accuracy in identifying the attacker's height (from information b).

1. Baseline probability (P(H)): According to information a, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the baseline probability P(H) is 0.15.
2. Witness's accuracy (P(W|H) and P(W|~H)): The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time if they are 185 cm or taller [P(W|H) = 0.8] and 80% of the time if they are shorter than 185 cm [P(W|~H) = 0.8]. However, since there is an equal number of people in both height categories when assessing the witness's accuracy, the witness's overall accuracy is 80%. The false positive rate (erroneous identification) is 20% [P(W|~H) = 0.2].
3. Bayes' theorem: Now, we need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (P(H|W)). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

We know that P(H) = 0.15, P(W|H) = 0.8, and P(W|~H) = 0.2. Also, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Now, calculate the probability:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3939 or 39.39%

However, the question asks for the probability as a number between 0 and 1:

{probability: 0.3939}
