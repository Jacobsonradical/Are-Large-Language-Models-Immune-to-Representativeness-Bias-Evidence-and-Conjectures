To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
	* Let P(T) be the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From information (a), we know that P(T) = 0.15.
	* Let P(S|T) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From information (b), we know that P(S|T) = 0.8.
	* Let P(S|F) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From information (b), we know that P(S|F) = 0.2.
	* Let P(S) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since P(S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|F) \* P(F), we need to find P(F), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), we know that P(F) = 0.85.
2. Apply Bayes' theorem:
	* We want to find P(T|S), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. By Bayes' theorem, P(T|S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) / P(S).
	* We have already calculated P(S|T) and P(T). We can calculate P(S) as follows: P(S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|F) \* P(F) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.29.
	* Therefore, P(T|S) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4138}.
