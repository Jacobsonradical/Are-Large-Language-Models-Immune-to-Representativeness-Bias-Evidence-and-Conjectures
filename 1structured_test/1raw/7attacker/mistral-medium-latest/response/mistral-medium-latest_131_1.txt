To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(W|T) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(S|T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population statistics.

We want to find P(T|W) \* P(W) / P(S|W). However, since P(W) is a constant factor for all heights, we can focus on estimating P(T|W) \* P(S|W).

From information (a), we know that P(W|T) = 0.8.
From information (b), we know that P(S|T) = 0.15.

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find P(T|W). We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / P(W)

However, without knowing the prior probability P(T), we can't directly calculate P(T|W). Instead, we can estimate a weighted average of the probabilities P(W|T) \* P(S|T) for the two possible height groups:

Estimated probability = P(W|T) \* P(S|T) for attacker being 185 cm or taller + P(W|not T) \* P(S|not T) for attacker being shorter than 185 cm

We know that P(W|T) = 0.8, P(S|T) = 0.15, and P(S|not T) = 0.85. We need to find P(W|not T) to complete the calculation. Since the witness's errors occur in 20% of the cases, and half of those errors involve identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:

P(W|not T) = (0.2) / 0.5 = 0.4

Now we can calculate the estimated probability:

Estimated probability = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.4 \* 0.85)
Estimated probability = 0.12 + 0.34
Estimated probability = 0.46

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.46.
