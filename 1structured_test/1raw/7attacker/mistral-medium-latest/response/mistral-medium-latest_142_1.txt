To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided, we have:

P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is given as 15%. So, P(H) = 0.15.

P(W|H): The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller is 80%. So, P(W|H) = 0.8.

P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is given as 85%. So, P(~H) = 0.85.

P(W|~H): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 20%. So, P(W|~H) = 0.2.

Now we need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. Using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and ~H) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.21 ≈ 0.5714

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5714.
