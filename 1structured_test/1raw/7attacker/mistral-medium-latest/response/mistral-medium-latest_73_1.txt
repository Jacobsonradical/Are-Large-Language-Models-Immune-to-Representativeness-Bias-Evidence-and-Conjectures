To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the given information, we know:
P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 0.8 (from statement b)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (from statement b)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545.
