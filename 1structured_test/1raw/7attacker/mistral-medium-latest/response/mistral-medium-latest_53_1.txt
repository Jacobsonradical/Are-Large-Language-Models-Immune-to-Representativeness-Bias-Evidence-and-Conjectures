To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W|H) = 0.80 (from b)

We also need to find P(W), the probability of the witness's testimony. To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We know P(W|H) and P(H), so we need to find P(W|not H) and P(not H). Since P(H) = 0.15, P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. From the information given, we can see that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so:

P(W|not H) = 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and will mistakenly identify a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So the estimated probability is: {probability: 0.41}
