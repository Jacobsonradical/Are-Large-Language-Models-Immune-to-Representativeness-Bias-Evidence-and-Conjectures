{probability: 0.54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we can estimate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution (information "a"): 15% or 0.15.
2. Next, we consider the witness's testimony (information "b"). The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We also know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when making such identifications.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:
   P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = [P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)] / P(Witness says 185+ cm)
4. We know that P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).
5. We also know that P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15 (based on the population distribution).
6. The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows: P(Witness says 185+ cm) = P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm).
7. We know that P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).
8. And P(Attacker is <185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
9. Plugging these values in, we get P(Witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
10. Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony: P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.54.
11. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.54.
