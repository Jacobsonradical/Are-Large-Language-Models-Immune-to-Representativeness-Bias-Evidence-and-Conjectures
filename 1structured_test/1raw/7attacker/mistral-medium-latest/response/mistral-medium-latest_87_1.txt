To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness identifies them correctly, or when the person is shorter than 185 cm and the witness makes an error.

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.214

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.214 ≈ 0.556

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.556.
