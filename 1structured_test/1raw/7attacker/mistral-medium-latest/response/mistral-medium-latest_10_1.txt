To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(B | A) = 1 (since the witness always identifies people who are 185 cm or taller correctly)
P(B | ¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A | B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / [P(B | A) \* P(A) + P(B | ¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | B) = 1 \* 0.15 / [1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15)]
P(A | B) ≈ 0.429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.429.
