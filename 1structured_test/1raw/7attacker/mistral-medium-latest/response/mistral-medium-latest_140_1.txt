To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness | Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)]

where:
P(Tall | Witness) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statement
P(Witness | Tall) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as tall (185 cm or taller)
P(Tall) is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller in the city
P(Not Tall) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm in the city
P(Witness | Not Tall) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall (185 cm or taller)

From the information provided:
P(Witness | Tall) = 0.80 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone as tall)
P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(Not Tall) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Witness | Not Tall) = 0.20 \* 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.03 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall, but adjusted for the actual proportion of tall people in the population)

Now we can calculate P(Tall | Witness):

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.03 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.39

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.39.

Answer format: {probability: 0.39}
