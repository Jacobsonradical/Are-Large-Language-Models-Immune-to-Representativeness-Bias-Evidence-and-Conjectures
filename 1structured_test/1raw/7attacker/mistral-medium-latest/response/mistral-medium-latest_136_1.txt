To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from information b)

We can also calculate P(E|~H), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm:
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and we assume that the witness is equally likely to make a false positive or false negative error)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:
- P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)
- P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
- P(H|E) = (P(E|H) \* P(H)) / P(E)
- P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

{probability: 0.4, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
