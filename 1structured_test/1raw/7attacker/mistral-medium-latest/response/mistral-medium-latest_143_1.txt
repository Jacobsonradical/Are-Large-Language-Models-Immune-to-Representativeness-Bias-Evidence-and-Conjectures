{probability: 0.88, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We start with the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, so we need to find the probability that the witness is correct given this statement.
3. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct when they say a person is 185 cm or taller: P(correct | witness says 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
4. However, we also need to account for the probability of the witness being wrong when they say a person is 185 cm or taller. This probability is P(incorrect | witness says 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says they are:

P(185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness says 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness says 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness says 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) \* P(shorter than 185 cm)]

6. Plugging in the values from steps 1, 3, and 4, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.88 or 88%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.88.
