To find the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where ¬A represents the event of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

a) P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
b) P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
c) P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
d) P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.395
