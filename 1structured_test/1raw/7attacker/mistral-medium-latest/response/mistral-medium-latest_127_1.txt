We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A given event B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing event B given that event A is true. In this case, it is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A. From the given information, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
* P(B) is the probability of observing event B, regardless of whether event A is true or not. We can calculate this probability using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where:

* P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
* P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From the given information, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
