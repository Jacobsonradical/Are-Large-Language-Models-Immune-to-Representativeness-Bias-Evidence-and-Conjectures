To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Our goal is to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

From the given information:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm:

- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.393

{probability: 0.393}
