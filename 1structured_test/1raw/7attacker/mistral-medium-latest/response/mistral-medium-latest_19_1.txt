To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we need to find P(W). We can do this by using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Plugging in the values:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41379.
