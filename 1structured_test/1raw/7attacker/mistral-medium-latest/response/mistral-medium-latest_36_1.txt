To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a rule that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (evidence B). Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. To find this probability, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We also know that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). However, we don't know P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. From the problem statement, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when judging the height of people shorter than 185 cm. Since half of the people in the sample used to assess the witness's ability are shorter than 185 cm, this means that the witness incorrectly identifies 20%/2 = 10% of people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.1.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.085
P(B) = 0.205

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.205
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5854

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.5854.
