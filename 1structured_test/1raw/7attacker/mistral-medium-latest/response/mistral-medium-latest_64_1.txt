To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the witness's testimony as W. We want to find P(H | W).

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H). According to the information provided, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, so:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W | H). In this case, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so:

P(W | H) = 0.8

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(W | ~H). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this means that they incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter. Therefore:

P(W | ~H) = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H | W) = P(W | H) \* P(H) / [P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | ~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H | W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H | W) â‰ˆ 0.42

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.42.
