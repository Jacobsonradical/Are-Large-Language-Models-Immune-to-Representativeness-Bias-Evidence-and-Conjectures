To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of updating probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
2. We are given the following probabilities:
   - P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
   - P(B|A) = 1.0 (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such)
   - P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from information b, the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
   - P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
4. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
   - P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
5. Plugging in the values, we get:
   - P(B) = (1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.33
6. Finally, we can find P(A|B):
   - P(A|B) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / 0.33 = 0.4545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4545.
