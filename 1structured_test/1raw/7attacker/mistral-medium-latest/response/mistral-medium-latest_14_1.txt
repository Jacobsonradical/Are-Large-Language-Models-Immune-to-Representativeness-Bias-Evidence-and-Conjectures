To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information a).

P(~H) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from information a).

P(W|H) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information b).

P(W|~H) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from information b).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W) as follows:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36/(0.36+0.17) â‰ˆ 0.678}
