To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate (information a) and the witness's accuracy (information b).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(Taller | Witness) = (P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller)) / P(Witness)

1. P(Taller | Witness): The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony. This is what we want to find.
2. P(Witness | Taller): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller if they indeed are. From the information given, this is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
3. P(Taller): The base rate of people in the city being 185 cm or taller. From the information given, this is 0.15 (15%).
4. P(Witness): The probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness and Taller) + P(Witness and Shorter)
= P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) \* P(Shorter)

Since P(Witness | Shorter) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, it's equal to 0.2 (20% error rate). The probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, P(Shorter), is 0.85 (85%). Thus, P(Witness) becomes:

P(Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find our desired probability:

P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
