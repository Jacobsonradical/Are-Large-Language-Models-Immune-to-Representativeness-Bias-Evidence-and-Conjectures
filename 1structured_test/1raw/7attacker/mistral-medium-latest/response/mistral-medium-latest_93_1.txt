To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the given information:

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

After calculating the expression, we get:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.441

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.441.
