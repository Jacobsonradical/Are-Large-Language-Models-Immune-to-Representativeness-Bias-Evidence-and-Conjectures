To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here are the given probabilities:

P(A) = probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information a)
P(B|A) = probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information b)
P(B|¬A) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (from information b)
P(¬A) = probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information a)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the numerator:
0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Calculate the denominator:
(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
