To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from b)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from a)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from b)

First, we need to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
