To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find some probabilities:

1. P(H): The probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. P(~H): The probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. P(W|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
4. P(W|~H): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

probability: 0.375 or 37.5%

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.
