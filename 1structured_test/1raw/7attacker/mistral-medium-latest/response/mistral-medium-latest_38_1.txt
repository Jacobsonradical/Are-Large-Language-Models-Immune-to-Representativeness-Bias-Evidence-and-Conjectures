To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (from information a).
P(C|T) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.8 (from information b).
P(C|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 0.2 (from information b).
P(F) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 0.85 (from information a).

We want to find P(T|C), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(T|C) = [P(C|T) \* P(T)] / [P(C|T) \* P(T) + P(C|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(T|C) â‰ˆ 0.3929

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3929.
