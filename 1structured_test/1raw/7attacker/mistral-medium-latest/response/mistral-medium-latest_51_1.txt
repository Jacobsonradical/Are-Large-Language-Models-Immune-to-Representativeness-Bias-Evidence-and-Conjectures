To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we want to find)
- P(S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(T|S) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so

We know that P(T) = 0.15 (from information a). Now we need to find P(S) and P(T|S).

Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we have:

- P(S|T) = 0.8 (probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller)
- P(S|not T) = 0.2 (probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) / [P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|not T) \* P(not T)]

We can calculate P(not T) as 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. Plugging in the values:

P(T|S) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4286

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is about 0.4286.
