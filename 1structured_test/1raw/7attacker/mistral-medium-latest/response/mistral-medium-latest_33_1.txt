To calculate the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:
H is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(E|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(H|E) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3571

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3571.
