To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information.

First, let's denote the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population as P(H). From information b, we have:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's testimony. We know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness identifying them correctly is 0.8. However, we also need to take into account the possibility that the witness may incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as:

P(Incorrect identification) = 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. This is given by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height multiplied by the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population, plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller multiplied by the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm in the population:

P(Attacker 185 cm or taller | Witness testimony) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.224

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.224}
