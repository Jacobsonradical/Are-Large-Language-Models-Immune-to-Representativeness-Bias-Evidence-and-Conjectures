To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, the prior probability is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15), and the likelihood is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness said so)

We know that:

P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy rate)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)

To find P(Witness said so), we can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes. In this case, the event is the witness saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the possible outcomes are the attacker being 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm.

P(Witness said so) = P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness said so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know that:

P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of the witness saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(Witness said so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17) = 0.285

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.285 = 0.4211

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4211.
