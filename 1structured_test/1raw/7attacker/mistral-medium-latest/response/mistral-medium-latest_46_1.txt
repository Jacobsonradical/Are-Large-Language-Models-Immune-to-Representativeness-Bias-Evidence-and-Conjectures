To calculate the estimated probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a)
- P(S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(T|S) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so

We want to find P(T|S).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / P(S)

First, let's find P(T) from information a:
P(T) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's find P(S|T), which is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they indeed are 185 cm or taller. From information b, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so:
P(S|T) = 80% = 0.80

Now, let's find P(S), which is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(S) = P(S|T) * P(T) + P(S|F) * P(F)

Where P(F) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(S|F) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

From information a:
P(F) = 85% = 0.85

From information b, the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying heights, so:
P(S|F) = 20% = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(S):
P(S) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(T|S) using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|S) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.
