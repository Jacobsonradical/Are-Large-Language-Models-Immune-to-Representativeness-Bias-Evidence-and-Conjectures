To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

First, from the information given in a), P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 0.85

Next, we can calculate the probabilities P(W|H) and P(W|~H) based on the witness's accuracy.

P(W|H) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy when the person is tall, which is 0.80.

P(W|~H) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate when the person is not tall, which is 0.20.

Finally, we need to calculate P(W). Using the law of total probability, P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

P(W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.522.

{probability: 0.522}
