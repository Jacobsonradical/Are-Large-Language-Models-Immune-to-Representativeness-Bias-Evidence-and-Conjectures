To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula to find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E). In this case, the hypothesis H is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and the evidence E is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

First, let's denote:
P(H) = the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (0.15, according to information a)
P(~H) = the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm (0.85, according to information a)
P(E|H) = the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.8, according to information b)
P(E|~H) = the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.2, according to information b)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E), which is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) = 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
