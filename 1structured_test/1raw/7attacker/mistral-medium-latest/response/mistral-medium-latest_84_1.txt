To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as B.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller. According to the given information (a), this probability is 15%.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information (b), this probability is 80%.

We also need to find the probability P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is 20%.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
probability ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4138.
