To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

Now let's find the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem:

1. P(W|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8
2. P(H): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15
3. P(W): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This is a bit more complicated, as we need to consider both the cases when the attacker is actually shorter or taller than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W and attacker is shorter than 185 cm) + P(W and attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(W|not H) \* P(not H) + P(W|H) \* P(H)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(W|not H) = 0.2. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not H) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation:

P(W) = (0.2 \* 0.85) + (0.8 \* 0.15) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now we have all the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

{probability: 0.4138}
