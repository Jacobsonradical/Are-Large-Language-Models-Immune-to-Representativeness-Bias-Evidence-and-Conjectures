To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 0.80 (from statement b)
P(W|not H) = 0.20 (from statement b)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.395.
