To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A is the event "Attacker is shorter than 185 cm". We are given that P(¬A) = 0.85.

We just need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness incorrectly testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. From the information provided, this error rate is 20%, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.21

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.5714

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.5714.
