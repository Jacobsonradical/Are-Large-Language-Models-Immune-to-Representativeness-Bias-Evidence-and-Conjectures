To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height, we need to consider two cases:

1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H), and the witness correctly identifies them as such (W). The probability of this case is P(W|H) \* P(H) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12.
2. The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (¬H), but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (W). The probability of this case is P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H). Since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(W|¬H) = 0.2 and P(¬H) = 0.85. Therefore, the probability of this case is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can find the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
