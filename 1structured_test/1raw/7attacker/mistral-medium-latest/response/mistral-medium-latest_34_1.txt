To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

First, we know from statement (a) that P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85 (where ¬A represents the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Next, we can find P(B|A) and P(B|¬A) using the witness's accuracy rate from statement (b). P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. From the information, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From the information, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(B) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5217

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5217.
