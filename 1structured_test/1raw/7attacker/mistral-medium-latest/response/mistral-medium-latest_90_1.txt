To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)
P(W|H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W|~H): the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information a)

Now we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

P(H|W) = [(0.8) \* (0.15)] / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)]

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4091

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4091.
