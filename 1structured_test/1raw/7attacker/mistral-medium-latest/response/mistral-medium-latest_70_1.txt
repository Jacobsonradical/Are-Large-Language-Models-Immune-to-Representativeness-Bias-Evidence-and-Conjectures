To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from information b)
P(W | A) = 1.0 (since the witness always identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
P(W | ¬A) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

First, let's find P(A | W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | W) = P(W | A) * P(A) / [P(W | A) * P(A) + P(W | ¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A | W) = (1.0 * 0.15) / [(1.0 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4286.
