To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population (from information b).
P(W|T) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (from information a).

We want to find P(T|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

From information b, we have P(T) = 0.15 and P(F) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85.

From information a, we have P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|F) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.444
