{probability: 0.51, explanation: "Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H) given the witness testimony (W) is P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]. Here, P(H) = 0.15 (from information a), P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information b), P(~H) = 0.85 (from information a), and P(W|~H) = 0.2 (from information b). Plugging these values in, we get P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.51."}
