{probability: 0.89, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Based on the information in statement 'a', we know that the prior probability of a random person from the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Statement 'b' tells us that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying the height under similar conditions.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
4. Let's denote the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller" as B. We want to find P(A|B).
5. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B).
6. P(A) is the prior probability, which is 0.15 (from statement 'a').
7. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 (80%, from statement 'b').
8. To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when they are not.
9. P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A).
10. P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85%, from statement 'a').
11. P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This probability is 0.2 (20%, from statement 'b').
12. Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
13. Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.89.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.89.
