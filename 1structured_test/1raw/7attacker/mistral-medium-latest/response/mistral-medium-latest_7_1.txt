To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we need P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H'), where H' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W|H') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(H') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H') = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.255

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.467
