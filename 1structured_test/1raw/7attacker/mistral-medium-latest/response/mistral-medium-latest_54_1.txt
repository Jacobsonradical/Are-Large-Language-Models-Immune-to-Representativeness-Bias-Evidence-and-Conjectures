To find the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) / P(Witness)

1. P(Witness | Taller): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information b).
2. P(Taller): The probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information a).
3. P(Witness): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. We can calculate this by law of total probability:
   P(Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) \* P(Shorter)
   Since P(Shorter) = 1 - P(Taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, and the witness errs in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (information b), P(Witness | Shorter) = 0.2.
   Therefore, P(Witness) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:
P(Taller | Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) / P(Witness) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, {probability: 0.4138}
