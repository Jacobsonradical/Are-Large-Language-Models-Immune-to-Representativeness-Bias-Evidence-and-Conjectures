To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use a form of Bayesian reasoning. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15 based on information b).
P(B|A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 based on information a).
P(B|¬A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2 based on information a).
P(¬A) as the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (which is 0.85 based on information b).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4286.
