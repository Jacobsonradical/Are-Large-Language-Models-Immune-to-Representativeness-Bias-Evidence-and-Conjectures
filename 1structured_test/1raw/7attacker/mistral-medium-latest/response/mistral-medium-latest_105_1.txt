To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 0.15 based on information a.
- P(S) as the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- P(W|T) as the probability of the witness identifying a tall person correctly, which is 0.8 based on information b.
- P(W|S) as the probability of the witness identifying a short person correctly, which is also 0.8 since the witness errs 20% of the time.

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|S) \* P(S)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.8 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find:

P(T|W) ≈ 0.16 or 16%

However, this does not take into account the fact that the witness errs more frequently on short people than tall people. Since we know the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, it means they didn't erroneously identify a short person as tall. Therefore, the witness's error rate on short people doesn't affect our calculation.

Taking this into account, we can redefine P(W|S) as the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a short person as tall, which is 0.2 (since they err 20% of the time and half of the sample is short). Now we have:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find:

P(T|W) ≈ 0.42 or 42%

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 42%.
