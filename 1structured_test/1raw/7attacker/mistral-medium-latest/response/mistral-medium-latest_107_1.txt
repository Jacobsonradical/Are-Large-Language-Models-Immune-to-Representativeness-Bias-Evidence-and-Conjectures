To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.387

{probability: 0.387}
