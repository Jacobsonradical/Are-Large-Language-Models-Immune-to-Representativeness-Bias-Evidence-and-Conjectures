To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [ P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H) ]

Where:
H = the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

From the information given, we have:
P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
