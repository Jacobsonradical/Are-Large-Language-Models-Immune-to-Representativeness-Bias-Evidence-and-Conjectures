To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying the height, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|¬A) × P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.120 / (0.120 + 0.170)
       = 0.120 / 0.290
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
