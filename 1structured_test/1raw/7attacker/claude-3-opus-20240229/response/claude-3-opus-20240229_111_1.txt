To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)

P(A) = 0.15 (based on the population distribution)
P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness's accuracy when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (based on the population distribution)

P(W) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
