To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- T: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|T) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not T) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

We want to calculate P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)]

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
