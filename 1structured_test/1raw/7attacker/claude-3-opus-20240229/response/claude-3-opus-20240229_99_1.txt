To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person's height when they are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person's height when they are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
