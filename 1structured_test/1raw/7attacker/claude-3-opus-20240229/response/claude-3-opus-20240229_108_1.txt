To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
