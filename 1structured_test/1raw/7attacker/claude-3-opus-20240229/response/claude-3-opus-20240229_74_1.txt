To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- P(T) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|T) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(W|S) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm

From the given information:
- P(T) = 0.15
- P(W|T) = 0.80
- P(W|S) = 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = (P(W|T) × P(T)) / (P(W|T) × P(T) + P(W|S) × (1 - P(T)))

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × (1 - 0.15))
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
