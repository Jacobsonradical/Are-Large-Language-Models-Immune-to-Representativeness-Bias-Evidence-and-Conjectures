To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
