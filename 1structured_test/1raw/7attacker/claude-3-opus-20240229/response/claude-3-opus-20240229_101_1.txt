To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.120 / (0.120 + 0.170)
       = 0.120 / 0.290
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
