Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is good at judging height, but not perfect. 
* **Population Distribution:**  The city's population has a specific height distribution.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

**Bayesian Approach**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to solve this. Here's how it works:

* **Prior Probability:** This is the initial probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) based on the population distribution.  P(Tall) = 0.15 
* **Likelihood:** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given their actual height. 
    * P(Witness says Tall | Tall) = 0.8 (80% correct identification)
    * P(Witness says Tall | Not Tall) = 0.2 (20% incorrect identification)
* **Posterior Probability:** This is the probability of the attacker being tall *given* the witness's testimony. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = [P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness says Tall)

**Calculating P(Witness says Tall)**

We need to account for both scenarios: 

* The witness correctly identifies a tall person.
* The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.

P(Witness says Tall) = [P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] + [P(Witness says Tall | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)]
P(Witness says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating Posterior Probability:**

P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Tall | Witness says Tall) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the witness testimony and the city's population distribution, we estimate a probability of about 0.414 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
