Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is likely to be accurate 80% of the time, but there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Population Data:** The majority of the population (85%) is shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness testimony:

* **P(Tall | Testimony):** The probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Testimony | Tall):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall *given* they actually are tall (this is 80% from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (this is 15% from the population data).
* **P(Testimony):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall (we'll calculate this below).

**Calculating P(Testimony)**

To find P(Testimony), we need to consider the two possible scenarios that lead to the witness saying the attacker is tall:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is actually tall, and the witness correctly identifies them (probability: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12).
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is actually short, and the witness incorrectly identifies them (probability: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17).

Therefore, P(Testimony) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Bayes' Theorem Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Tall | Testimony) = [P(Testimony | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Testimony) 
                     = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
                     â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
