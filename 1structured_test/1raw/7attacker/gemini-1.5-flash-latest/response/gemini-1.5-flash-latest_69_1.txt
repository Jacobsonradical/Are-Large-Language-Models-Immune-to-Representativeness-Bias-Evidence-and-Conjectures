Here's how we can estimate the probability:

* **Prior probability:** We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from information "a"). This is our prior probability.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time (from information "b"). This is our likelihood.
* **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Posterior probability of A given B (the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony)
* P(B|A) = Likelihood of B given A (the probability the witness identifies correctly given the attacker is tall)
* P(A) = Prior probability of A (the probability the attacker is tall)
* P(B) = Probability of B (the probability the witness makes a certain identification, regardless of the attacker's height).

**Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is tall:** The witness identifies correctly with 80% probability (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is short:** The witness identifies incorrectly with 20% probability (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
