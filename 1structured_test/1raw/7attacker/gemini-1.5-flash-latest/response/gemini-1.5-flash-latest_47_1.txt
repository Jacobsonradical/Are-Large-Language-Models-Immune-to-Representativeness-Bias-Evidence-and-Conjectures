Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness identified them as tall.**

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given they are tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are not tall (20% error).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that someone in the city is tall (15% of the population).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that someone in the city is not tall (85% of the population).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
