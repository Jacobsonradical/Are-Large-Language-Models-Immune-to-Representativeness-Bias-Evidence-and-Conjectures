Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony and the population statistics. 

**Let's define events:**

* **T:** The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller).
* **NT:** The attacker is not tall (shorter than 185 cm).
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as tall.

**We know:**

* **P(T) = 0.15** (15% of the population is tall)
* **P(NT) = 0.85** (85% of the population is not tall)
* **P(W|T) = 0.80** (Probability of witness correctly identifying a tall person)
* **P(W|NT) = 0.20** (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness identified them as such.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|NT) * P(NT)
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
