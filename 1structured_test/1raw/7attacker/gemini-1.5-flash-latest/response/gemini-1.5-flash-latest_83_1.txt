Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% (given in "a").
* **P(¬A):** The probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the city is 85%.

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are, is 80% (given in "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter, is 20% (given in "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find  **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculate:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4138}
