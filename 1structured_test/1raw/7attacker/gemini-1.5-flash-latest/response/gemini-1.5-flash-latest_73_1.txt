Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of the population is in the taller group (185 cm or taller).
* **Information b:**  This gives us the witness's reliability. They are correct 80% of the time, but misidentify height 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.**  If the witness is correct about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, the probability of this being true is 80% (based on their reliability).

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.** If the witness is incorrect,  they've misidentified a person shorter than 185 cm as being taller. The probability of this happening is 20% (based on their reliability). 

**Combining the Scenarios**

To get the overall probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, we need to weight the probabilities of each scenario by the initial likelihood of each scenario:

* **Scenario 1:** Probability of witness being correct (80%) * Probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (15%) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** Probability of witness being incorrect (20%) * Probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm (85%) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

To get the overall probability, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.29}
