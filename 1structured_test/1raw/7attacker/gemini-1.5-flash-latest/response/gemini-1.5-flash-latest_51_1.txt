Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Information from the Problem**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from "b").
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (from "b").
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (from "a").
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (from "a").

**3.  Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about event A given new evidence (B):

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**4. Calculations**

* **P(B):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* **P(A|B):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615.**
