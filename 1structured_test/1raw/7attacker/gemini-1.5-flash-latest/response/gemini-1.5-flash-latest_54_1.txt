Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** This provides us with the witness's reliability in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) given new evidence (the witness's testimony). Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the general population proportion, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.46 or 46%.**
