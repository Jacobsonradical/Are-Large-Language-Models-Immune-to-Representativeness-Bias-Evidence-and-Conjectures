Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We know the following:**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information "b") = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given they are 185 cm or taller (from information "a") = 0.8
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.33

**P(A|B) ≈ 0.36**

**Therefore: {probability: 0.36}** 

**In conclusion, there is approximately a 36% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.**
