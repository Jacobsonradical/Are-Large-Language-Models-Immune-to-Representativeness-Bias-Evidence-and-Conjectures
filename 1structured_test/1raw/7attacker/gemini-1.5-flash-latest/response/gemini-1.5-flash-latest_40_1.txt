Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city (15%).
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but crucially, it's not perfect.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the base rate with the witness's accuracy to arrive at the final probability. This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief based on new evidence.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Let's define events:**
    *  A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

* **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

   Let's break down each component:
    * **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (0.8).
    * **P(A):** The base rate of people being 185 cm or taller, 15% (0.15).
    * **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier and requires considering both true positives and false positives.

* **Calculating P(B):**
    * **True positives:**  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 
    * **False positives:**  P(B| not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * **P(B) = True positives + False positives = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

* **Putting it all together:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**In conclusion:** The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
