Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|~A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city.
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

**Let's calculate:**

1. **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**

2. **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615** (approximately)

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4615}
