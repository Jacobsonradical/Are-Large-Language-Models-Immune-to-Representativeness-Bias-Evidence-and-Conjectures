Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:**  Gives us the witness's reliability. They are correct 80% of the time, but misjudge height 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information about the population distribution with the witness's accuracy.  Here's how:

1. **Start with the witness's statement:** The witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
2. **Consider the witness's accuracy:** The witness is correct 80% of the time. This means there's an 80% chance the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.
3. **Factor in the population distribution:**  We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 

**The Problem:**  We can't simply multiply 0.80 (witness accuracy) by 0.15 (population proportion) because the witness's statement already biases the situation.  We're not dealing with random chance anymore.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a tool for updating probabilities based on new evidence.  Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall, given the witness's statement.  Bayes' Theorem says:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.80.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being tall, which is 0.15 (from the population distribution).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying "tall".  This is a bit trickier.  We need to consider both scenarios: the witness being correct and incorrect.

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate, 0.20.
* **P(not A):** Probability of an attacker being short, which is 0.85 (1 - 0.15).

**Calculations**

1. **P(B):** (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
2. **P(A|B):** (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:** 

Given the witness's statement and the population distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
