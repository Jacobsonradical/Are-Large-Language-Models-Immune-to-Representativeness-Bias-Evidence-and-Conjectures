Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in statement "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually taller:** 80% (given in statement "b")
* **Likelihood of witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter:** 20% (given in statement "b") 

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Let:

* A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* B = Witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the witness said so.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is taller and shorter:

* P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
