Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness's accuracy is given, but their identification is not definitive.
* **Population Statistics:**  We know the percentage of the population above and below the height threshold.

**Bayes' Theorem Approach:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:

*  A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from population statistics): 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B):**

We use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter. This is the witness's error rate: 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):**  Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Finally, calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
