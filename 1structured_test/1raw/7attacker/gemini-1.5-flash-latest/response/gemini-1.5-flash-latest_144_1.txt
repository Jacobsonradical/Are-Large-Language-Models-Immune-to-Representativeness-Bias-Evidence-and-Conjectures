Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given that another event (B) has occurred:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are (from information "b"). This is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information "a"). This is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The person is actually 185 cm or taller (A), and the witness is correct (B|A) 
    * P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** The person is actually shorter than 185 cm (not A), and the witness is wrong (B|not A)
    * P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 

To get P(B), we sum these two scenarios:

* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
