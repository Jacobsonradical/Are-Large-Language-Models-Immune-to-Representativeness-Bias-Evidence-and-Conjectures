Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  
* **Information b:** This gives us the base probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's testimony.  

* Let 'A' be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let 'W' be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(A|W): Probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.
* P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as tall given they are actually tall (80% from information a).
* P(A): Base probability of someone being tall in the city (15% from information b).
* P(W): Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(W)**

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both cases: 

* The witness correctly identifies a tall person (P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17) 

Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
