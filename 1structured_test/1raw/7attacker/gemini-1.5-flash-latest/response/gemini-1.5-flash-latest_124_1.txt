Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:**  Gives us the witness's accuracy in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are that height. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from information a).
* **P(B):**  The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability. 

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** The probability someone is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
