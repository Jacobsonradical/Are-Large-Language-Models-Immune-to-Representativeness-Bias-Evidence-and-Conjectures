Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:**  Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Reasoning:**

We need to combine the general population information with the witness's reliability. We can think of this as a conditional probability problem:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness identified them as such.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate this conditional probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the general population proportion, which is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This is more complex, as it involves both correct and incorrect identifications.

**Calculating P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
* **P(¬A):** The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is 1 - P(A) = 85%.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.  While the witness's testimony increases the probability from the general population rate of 15%, it's still not a certainty.
