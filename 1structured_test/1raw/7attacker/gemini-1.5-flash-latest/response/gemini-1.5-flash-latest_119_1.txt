Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This tells us the witness's reliability.  The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying height, regardless of the actual height. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) given new evidence (the witness's testimony):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy, 80%).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the general population proportion, 15%).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **The attacker is 185 cm or taller:**  Probability is 0.15 (from information a) * 0.80 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 
2. **The attacker is shorter than 185 cm:** Probability is 0.85 (from information a) * 0.20 (witness error) = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
