Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**We are given:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are that tall.
* **P(B|~A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To calculate P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
