Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  From information "a", we know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.
* **P(¬A):**  Therefore, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. So, P(¬A) = 0.85.

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from witness accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness correctly identified the height given the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 80%. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness incorrectly identified the height given the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 20%. So, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
