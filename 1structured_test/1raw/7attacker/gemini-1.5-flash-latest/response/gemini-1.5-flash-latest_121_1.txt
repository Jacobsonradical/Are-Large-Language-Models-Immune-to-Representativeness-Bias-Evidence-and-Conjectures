Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in judging height, with 80% being correct and 20% being wrong.

**Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update the probability based on the witness's testimony:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The person is actually 185 cm or taller (probability 0.15). The witness is correct (probability 0.80).
* **Scenario 2:** The person is actually shorter than 185 cm (probability 0.85). The witness is wrong (probability 0.20).

```
P(B) = (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.29
```

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
