Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.  This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the population proportion).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate the Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (from information 'a')
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (from information 'b')
* **P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)**  
    * P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness's error rate)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
