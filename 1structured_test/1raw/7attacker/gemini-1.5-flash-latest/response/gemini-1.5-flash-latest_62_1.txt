Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This tells us the witness's reliability in identifying height. They are correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To get a more accurate estimate than just relying on the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the witness identified them as such (event B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from information b, this is 0.8).
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (from information a, this is 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider both cases:

* **Case 1: The person is actually 185 cm or taller:**  The probability of this is 0.15 (from information a). The witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability of them identifying them correctly is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
* **Case 2: The person is actually shorter than 185 cm:** The probability of this is 0.85 (from information a). The witness is wrong 20% of the time, so the probability of them incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Therefore:
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
