Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the base rate of people in the city being 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **Information b:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  The witness is correct 80% of the time, but makes a mistake 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.  Here's the formula:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% accuracy).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% from information a).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not (20% error rate).
* P(not A) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85% from information a).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.
