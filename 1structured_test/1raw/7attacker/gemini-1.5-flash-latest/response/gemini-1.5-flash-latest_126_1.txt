Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness testimony:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions.
* **Population distribution:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find:

* **P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall)**  - The probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**Applying the information to Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness says "tall" given the attacker IS tall = 80% (accuracy of the witness)
* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is tall = 15% (population distribution)
* **P(B):** Probability the witness says "tall" (this is a bit trickier, we'll calculate it below)

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness might say "tall":

1. **Scenario 1:** Attacker IS tall, and witness correctly says so:  P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2. **Scenario 2:** Attacker is NOT tall, but witness incorrectly says so: P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**P(B) is the sum of these scenarios:** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Finally, let's plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
