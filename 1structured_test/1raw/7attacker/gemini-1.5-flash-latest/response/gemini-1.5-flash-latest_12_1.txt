Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is reliable but not perfect. They have a chance of being wrong.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation is best addressed using Bayes' Theorem.  It helps us update our beliefs about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

* **Let A be the event:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Let B be the event:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness saying someone is tall *given* they actually are tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, based on the population: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying someone is tall (regardless of their actual height). This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider both scenarios:

* **Witness is correct:**  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Witness is wrong:** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
