Here's how we can estimate the probability:

* **Prior Probability:** We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is correct 80% of the time.  

* **Applying Bayes' Theorem:** To get the updated probability after considering the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

   P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

   Let's break down the terms:

   * **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability we want to find - the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness says they are tall.
   * **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the probability the witness correctly identifies a tall person, which is 80%.
   * **P(Attacker Tall):** This is our prior probability of 15%.
   * **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability that the witness says someone is tall. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
      * P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)
      * P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

   Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

   P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
