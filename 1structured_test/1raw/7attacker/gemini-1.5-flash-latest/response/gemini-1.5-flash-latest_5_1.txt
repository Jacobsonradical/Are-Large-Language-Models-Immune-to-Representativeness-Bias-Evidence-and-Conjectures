Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  **P(A):** The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information "b").
*  **P(¬A):** The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

*  **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are, which is 0.80 (from information "a").
*  **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter, which is 0.20 (from information "a").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
