Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is what we want to find – the probability the attacker was tall given the witness said so.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of someone being tall in the city, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability the witness says someone is tall, which we need to calculate.

**Calculating P(Witness Says Tall)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)

* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short):** This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(Attacker Short):** This is the prior probability of someone being short, which is 85% (0.85).

Therefore:

P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
