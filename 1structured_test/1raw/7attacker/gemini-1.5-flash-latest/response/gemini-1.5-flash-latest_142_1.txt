Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, based on the city's population distribution, 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (regardless of their actual height). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
