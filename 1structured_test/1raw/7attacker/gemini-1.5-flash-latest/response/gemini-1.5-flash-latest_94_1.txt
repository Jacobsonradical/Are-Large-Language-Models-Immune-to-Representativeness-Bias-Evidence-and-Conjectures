Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Fact b:** This gives us information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **T:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|T):** Probability the witness identifies someone as tall given they are actually tall.  This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% from fact b.
* **P(T):** Prior probability the attacker is tall, which is 15% from fact a.
* **P(W):** Probability the witness identifies someone as tall. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(W)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|¬T) * P(¬T)

Where:

* **¬T:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **P(W|¬T):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are actually short (20% from fact b).
* **P(¬T):** Probability the attacker is short (85% from fact a).

Plugging in the values:

P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(T|W)**

Now we have all the components to calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
