Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(A):**  Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from population data) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter = 0.20

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**4. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
