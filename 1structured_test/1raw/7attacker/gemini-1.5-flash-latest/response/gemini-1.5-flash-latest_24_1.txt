Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to combine the information from the witness and the population statistics to estimate the likelihood the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Problem**

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.**

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's identification.

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).
* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
* **P(B) = ?** (This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, regardless of their actual height). We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the Law of Total Probability:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time).
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the information provided, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
