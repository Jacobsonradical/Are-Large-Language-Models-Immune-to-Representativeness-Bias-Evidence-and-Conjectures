Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions. This is crucial for adjusting our estimate based on their testimony.

**Calculating the Probability**

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of the population with that height: 15% or 0.15.

2. **Likelihood:** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given their actual height.
    * If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time. 
    * If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will mistakenly identify them as tall 20% of the time.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony. 

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) =  Probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's identification. (This is what we want to find).
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are actually tall (80% or 0.8).
* P(A) = Prior probability of someone being tall (15% or 0.15).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall person)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of being tall)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short person as tall)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of being short)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 or 48%.**
