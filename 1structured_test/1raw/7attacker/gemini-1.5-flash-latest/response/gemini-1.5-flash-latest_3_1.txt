Here's how to approach this problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** This gives us the witness's reliability in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A (attacker is 185 cm or taller) given event B (witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% from information "a".
* P(B): The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is calculated below.

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller (probability = 0.15). The witness will say this correctly 80% of the time. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm (probability = 0.85). The witness will incorrectly say they are taller 20% of the time. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**In conclusion:**  Based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
