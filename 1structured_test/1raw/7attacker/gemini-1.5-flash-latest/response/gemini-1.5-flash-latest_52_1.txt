Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** This tells us the reliability of the witness's identification.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
