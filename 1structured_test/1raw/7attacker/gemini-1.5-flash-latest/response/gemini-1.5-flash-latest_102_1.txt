Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of the population is in the height range we're interested in (185 cm or taller).
* **Information b:** This provides us with the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  They are correct 80% of the time, and wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

*  **T:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|T):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):**  Prior probability of someone being tall in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (this includes both correctly identifying tall people and incorrectly identifying short people as tall). To find this, we need to consider both scenarios:

    * **Correctly identifying tall people:**  P(W|T) * P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * **Incorrectly identifying short people:** P(W|T') * P(T') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (where T' represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

    Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the population height distribution, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.
