Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability of the witness correctly identifying the height given the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information 'a').
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (from information 'a').
* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller (from information 'b').
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm (from information 'b').

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.34
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353}
