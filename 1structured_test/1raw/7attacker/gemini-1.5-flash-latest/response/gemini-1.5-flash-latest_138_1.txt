Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is generally reliable in judging height but made some errors.
* **Population Statistics:**  A smaller percentage of the population is taller than 185 cm.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed taller than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall *given* they are actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%. 
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone is tall. This is the population statistic, 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall. This requires considering both true positives (tall people identified correctly) and false positives (short people identified incorrectly). We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
