Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning they are likely to be accurate.
* **Information b:** The city's population distribution tells us that there's a much higher chance the attacker was *shorter* than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement. Here's the breakdown:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually are* that tall. This is given as 80% (or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% (or 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier and requires the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B| not A) = 20% (or 0.2) - the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
    * P(not A) = 85% (or 0.85) - the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or about 41.38%.
