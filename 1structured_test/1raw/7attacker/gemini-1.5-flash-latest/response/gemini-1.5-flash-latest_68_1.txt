Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior probability:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our initial belief before considering the witness's testimony.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. This tells us how likely the witness is to be right, given the person's actual height.

We need to combine these to get the **posterior probability**, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating beliefs in light of new evidence:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (our posterior probability).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened (our likelihood).
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening (our prior probability).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**Applying the values to Bayes' Theorem:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
