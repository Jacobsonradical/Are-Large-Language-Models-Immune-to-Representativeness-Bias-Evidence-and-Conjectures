Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, along with the knowledge that they identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem lends itself well to Bayes' Theorem. It helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are. From information b, this is 80% or 0.8. 
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From information a, this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The overall probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46}
