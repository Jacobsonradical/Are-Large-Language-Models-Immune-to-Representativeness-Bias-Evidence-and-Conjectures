Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **a:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  They are correct 80% of the time, meaning if someone is actually taller than 185 cm, there's an 80% chance they'll be identified as such.
* **b:** This tells us the general population distribution of heights.  15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker taller | Witness says taller) = [P(Witness says taller | Attacker taller) * P(Attacker taller)] / P(Witness says taller)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(Witness says taller | Attacker taller) = 0.8** (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
* **P(Attacker taller) = 0.15** (The proportion of the population taller than 185 cm)
* **P(Witness says taller)**: This is the probability that the witness will say someone is taller than 185 cm, regardless of their actual height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness says taller) = P(Witness says taller | Attacker taller) * P(Attacker taller) + P(Witness says taller | Attacker shorter) * P(Attacker shorter)
    * P(Witness says taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation:**

Now, we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker taller | Witness says taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
