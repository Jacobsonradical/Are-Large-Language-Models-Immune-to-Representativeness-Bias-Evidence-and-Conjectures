Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(A|W): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. (This is what we want to find).
* P(W|A): Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that tall (80% from the information provided).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% from the information provided).
* P(W): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (This needs to be calculated).

**3. Calculate P(W):**

We need to consider the two ways the witness could identify someone as 185 cm or taller:

* **Scenario 1:**  The person is actually taller than 185 cm, and the witness correctly identifies them (80% chance).
* **Scenario 2:** The person is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness incorrectly identifies them (20% chance).

Therefore:

* P(W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] + [P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|W):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
