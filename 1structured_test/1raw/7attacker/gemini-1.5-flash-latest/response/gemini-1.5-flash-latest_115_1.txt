Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of the population is in the category we're interested in (185 cm or taller).
* **Information b:**  This tells us about the witness's reliability. They have an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height category, regardless of whether the person is actually tall or short.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:**
   * The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker as being tall.

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:**
   * The witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying the attacker as being tall.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To combine the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall) = [P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness said tall)

Let's break down the components:

* **P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall):** This is what we want to find – the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.
* **P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) = 0.8:** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall when they actually are tall (from information b).
* **P(Attacker is tall) = 0.15:** The prior probability of someone in the city being tall (from information a).
* **P(Witness said tall):** This is the probability the witness identifies someone as tall, regardless of their actual height. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness said tall) = P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness said tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)
    * P(Witness said tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
