Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy rate in judging height.
* **Population distribution:**  The city's population has a specific height distribution.

We want to combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability we want to find â€“ the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy rate when the attacker is actually tall (80%).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is the population distribution of tall people (15%).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability the witness says the attacker is tall, which can be calculated using the law of total probability. 

**Calculating P(Witness Says Tall):**

P(Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] + [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]

* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short):** This is the witness's error rate when the attacker is short (20%).
* **P(Attacker Short):** This is the probability of the attacker being short (85%).

**Calculation:**

1. **P(Witness Says Tall):** 
   (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** 
   (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
