Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayesian reasoning. We want to update our belief about the attacker's height (tall or short) based on new evidence. 

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of an event before considering any new evidence. In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being tall is 15% (given by "b").
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence given a particular event. Here, the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are actually tall is 80% (from "a").
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of an event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**Calculations**

Let's use the following notation:

*  T = Attacker is tall (185 cm or taller)
*  S = Attacker is short (shorter than 185 cm)
*  W = Witness identified the attacker as tall

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness identified them as tall.

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(W|T) = 0.8 (likelihood of witness identifying someone as tall given they are tall)
* P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being tall)
* P(W) =  P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)  (total probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, considering both scenarios)

To calculate P(W|S) (likelihood of witness identifying someone as tall given they are short), we use the information from "a" that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time: P(W|S) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
