Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior probability:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness reliability:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, but is wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

* **P(A|B):** Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's identification (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (this is a bit trickier to calculate).

**Calculating P(B)**

* **P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)**

   * P(B|not A) = 20% (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
   * P(not A) = 85% (the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm)

   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

* **P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)** 
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller increases from the initial 15% to approximately 41.4%.
