Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying height under similar conditions.
* **Population Data:** Only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

* Let  'A' be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let 'W' be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is the proportion of tall people in the population, 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
