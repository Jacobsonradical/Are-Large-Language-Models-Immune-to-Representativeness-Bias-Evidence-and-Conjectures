Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A|W):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such (this is what we want to find).
* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% from the information provided).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller (15% from the information provided).
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(W):**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(W|not A):** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (20% from the information provided).
* **P(not A):** The probability someone in the city is shorter than 185 cm (85% from the information provided).

Therefore:
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|W):**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
