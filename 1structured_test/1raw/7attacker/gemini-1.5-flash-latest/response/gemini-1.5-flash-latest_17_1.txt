Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact "a":**  We know the general population distribution of height in the city.
* **Fact "b":**  We have information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves conditional probability, and Bayes' Theorem is a useful tool for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened. In our case, this is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened. This is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they *actually* are that tall (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of event A happening (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% from Fact "a").
* **P(B):** The probability of event B happening (the probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller). 

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm (80% accuracy)
* **Scenario 2:** The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm (20% error)

P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of being taller)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of being shorter)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615.**
