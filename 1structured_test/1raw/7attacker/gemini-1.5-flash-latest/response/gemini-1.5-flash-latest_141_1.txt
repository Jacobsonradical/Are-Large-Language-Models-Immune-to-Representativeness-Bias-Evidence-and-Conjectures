Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a"**:  This tells us the general population distribution of height in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information "b"**: This provides information about the witness's reliability.  They are correct 80% of the time when identifying height in similar conditions. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

* **P(Tall | Witness Says Tall):** The probability the attacker is tall given the witness said they were tall. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Tall):** The probability the witness says someone is tall given they actually are tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of someone being tall, which is 15% from information "a".
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** The probability the witness says someone is tall. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Short) * P(Short) 
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability:**

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)
P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
