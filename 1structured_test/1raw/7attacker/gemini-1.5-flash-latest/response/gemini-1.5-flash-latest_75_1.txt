Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in judging height, but we need to consider their potential errors.
* **Population data:** We know the distribution of heights in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the witness's testimony (event B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.  This is a bit trickier to calculate, but we can use the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate (20%).
2. **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
3. **P(B):**  
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
4. **P(A|B):** Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
    * P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
    * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
    * P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Explanation**

Given the witness's testimony and the population data, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
