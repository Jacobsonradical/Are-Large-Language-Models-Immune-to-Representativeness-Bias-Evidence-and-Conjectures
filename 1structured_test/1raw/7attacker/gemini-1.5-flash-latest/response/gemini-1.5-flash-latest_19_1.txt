Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general population distribution of height. 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This gives us information about the witness's reliability. The witness is correct 80% of the time, meaning they have an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. 

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). This is a bit more complex to calculate.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).
* **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85% from information a).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
