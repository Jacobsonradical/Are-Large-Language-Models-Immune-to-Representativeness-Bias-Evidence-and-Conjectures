Here's how to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller is 15% (from information "a").
* **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller is 80% (from information "b"). This applies to both those who are truly 185 cm or taller and those who are shorter.
* **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony).

Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the witness correctly identifying height).
* P(A) is the prior probability of A (being 185 cm or taller).
* P(B) is the probability of B (witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height).

**Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller (80% of 15% = 12%) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (20% of 85% = 17%). 
* P(B) = 12% + 17% = 29%

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker 185 cm or taller | Witness says 185 cm or taller) =  [(0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29]  = 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
