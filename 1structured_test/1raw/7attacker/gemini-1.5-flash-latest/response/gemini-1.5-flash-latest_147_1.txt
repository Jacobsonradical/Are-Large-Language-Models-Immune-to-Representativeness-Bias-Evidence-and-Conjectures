Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Fact b:**  Provides information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.  

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as tall given they are actually tall. This is 80% (from fact b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is 15% (from fact a).
* **P(B):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    
    * P(B|not A):  The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are not tall (20% from fact b).
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is not tall (85% from fact a).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
