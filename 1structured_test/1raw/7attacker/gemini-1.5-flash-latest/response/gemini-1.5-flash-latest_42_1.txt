Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability we want to find - the probability the attacker was tall given the witness said so.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Tall):** This is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall when they actually are tall. From information b, this is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(Tall):** This is the prior probability of someone in the city being tall, which is 15% or 0.15 from information a.
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability the witness says someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(Witness Says Tall)**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Short) * P(Short)

* **P(Witness Says Tall | Short):** This is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall when they are actually short. From information b, this is 20% or 0.2.
* **P(Short):** This is the prior probability of someone in the city being short, which is 85% or 0.85 from information a.

Therefore:

P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(Tall | Witness Says Tall)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
