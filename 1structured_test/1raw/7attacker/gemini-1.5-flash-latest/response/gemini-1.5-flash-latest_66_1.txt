Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a specific accuracy rate in identifying height.

We want to find the **posterior probability** â€“ the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15)
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller given they actually are (0.80)
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller given they are not (0.20)

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

* **P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)**
* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**

**Calculating Posterior Probability**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)**
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
