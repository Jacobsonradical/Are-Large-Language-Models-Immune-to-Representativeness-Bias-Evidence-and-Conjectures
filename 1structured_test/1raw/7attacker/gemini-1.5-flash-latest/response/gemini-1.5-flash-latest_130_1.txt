Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height, specifically in a controlled setting.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = [P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness says tall)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall):** This is what we want to find – the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.
* **P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall):** This is the witness's accuracy in identifying someone as tall when they actually are tall, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(Attacker is tall):** This is the prior probability of someone being tall in the city, which is 15% (from information a).
* **P(Witness says tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(Witness says tall) = P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness says tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)
    P(Witness says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
