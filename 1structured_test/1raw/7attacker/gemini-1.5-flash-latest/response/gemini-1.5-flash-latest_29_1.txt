Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in identifying height, but they may be wrong.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the proportion of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is a classic example of where Bayes' Theorem is useful. It allows us to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define some events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall, *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is the population proportion of people taller than 185 cm, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is a bit trickier to calculate. We need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is tall, and the attacker is short.

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall, *given* the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is short, which is 85% (0.85).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it all together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
