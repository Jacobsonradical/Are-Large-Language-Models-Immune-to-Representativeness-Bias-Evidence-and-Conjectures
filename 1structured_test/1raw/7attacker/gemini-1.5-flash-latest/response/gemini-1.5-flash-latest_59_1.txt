Here's how to break down the problem to find the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Fact "a":**  This tells us the base rate of tall people (185 cm or taller) in the city.
* **Fact "b":**  This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but it's crucial to note that it's not perfect.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

To estimate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's testimony, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.  Here's the formula:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability that the attacker is tall (A) given the witness's statement (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall (B) given that the attacker is actually tall (A). This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is the base rate from fact "a" (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall, regardless of the actual height. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B):**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1:** The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller), and the witness is correct.
   *  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

2. **Scenario 2:** The attacker is short (shorter than 185 cm), and the witness is wrong.
   * P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we add these two probabilities to get the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall:

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Finally, we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
       â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
