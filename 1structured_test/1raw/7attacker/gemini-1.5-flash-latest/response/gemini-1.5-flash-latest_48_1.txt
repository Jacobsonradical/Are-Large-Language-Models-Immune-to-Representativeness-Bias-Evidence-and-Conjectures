Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they actually are.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that someone in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
