Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but crucially, it's biased towards correctly identifying taller people.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's testimony.

Let:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, given they are actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone being tall in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (regardless of their actual height). This is a bit tricky and requires considering both scenarios:
    * The witness correctly identifies a tall person: P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall: P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
