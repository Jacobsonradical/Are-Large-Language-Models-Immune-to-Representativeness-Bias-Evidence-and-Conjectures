Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height. The witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A|B):**  This is what we want to find – the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are – this is the witness's accuracy (80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15 from information a).
* **P(B):**  The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This requires a bit more calculation:

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: 

1. **The attacker is actually tall (185 cm or taller):** This happens with a probability of 0.15. The witness will correctly identify them as tall with 80% probability (0.8).
2. **The attacker is actually short (shorter than 185 cm):** This happens with a probability of 0.85. The witness will incorrectly identify them as tall with 20% probability (0.2).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or about 41.4%.
