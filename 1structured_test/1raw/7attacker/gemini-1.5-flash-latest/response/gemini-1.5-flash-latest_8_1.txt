Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.**

**We know the following from the given information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually that height.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.46

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.46.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.46}
