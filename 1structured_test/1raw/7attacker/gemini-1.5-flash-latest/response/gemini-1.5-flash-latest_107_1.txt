Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:** This tells us about the witness's reliability in identifying height.  

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker being tall) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
