Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to combine the information from the population statistics and the witness's testimony.  We know the attacker was taller than 185cm from the witness, but we need to factor in the witness's reliability.

**Calculations:**

* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of someone being 185cm or taller in the city is 15% (given in statement 'a').

* **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller is 80%.

* **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability (the probability the attacker was 185cm or taller given the witness's testimony):

   ```
   P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall) 
   ```

   *  P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) = 0.8 (the likelihood of the witness being correct)
   *  P(Attacker Tall) = 0.15 (the prior probability of someone being tall)
   *  P(Witness Says Tall) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
      *  P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)
      *  P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Result:**

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
