Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution of the population. 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability.  They are correct 80% of the time, but wrong 20% of the time when judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves a classic application of Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can use it:

* **Event A:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15) from information 'a'.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
