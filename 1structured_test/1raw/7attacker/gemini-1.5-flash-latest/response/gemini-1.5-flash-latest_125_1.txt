Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability: P(Taller) = 0.15

**2. Likelihoods:**

* The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time: P(Witness says Taller | Taller) = 0.8
* The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time: P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) = 0.2

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = [P(Witness says Taller | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness says Taller)

To calculate P(Witness says Taller), we need to consider both scenarios:

*  P(Witness says Taller) = P(Witness says Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) * P(Shorter)
* P(Witness says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
