Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This tells us the witness's reliability. They are correct 80% of the time, but misidentify height 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.**  The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are right. The probability of this scenario is the witness's accuracy (80%) multiplied by the probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city (15%). So, 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is wrong.**  The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, but they are wrong.  The probability of this scenario is the witness's error rate (20%) multiplied by the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the city (85%). So, 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the probability of Scenario 1 divided by the sum of probabilities for both scenarios.

Probability = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
