Here's how to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability:** We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. This is our likelihood.
* **Bayes' Theorem:**  We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

**Let's define:**

*  A: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  B: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
* P(B|A): Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that height (0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15).
* P(B): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios:

1. **The attacker is 185 cm or taller (A):**  The witness identifies them correctly with 80% probability (0.8).
2. **The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A):** The witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability (0.2).

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.462

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.462}
