Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probability**

* P(A) = 0.15 (given in information 'a')

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies taller people)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
