Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's reliability. They are correct 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance they misidentify someone's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is what we want to find - the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of someone in the city being tall, which is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)

    P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                       = 0.12 / 0.29
                                       â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
