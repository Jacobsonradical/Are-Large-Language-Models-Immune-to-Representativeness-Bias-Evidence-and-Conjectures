Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good identifier of height, but they are not perfect.  We have to consider both their accuracy and their tendency to overestimate.
* **Information b:** The population distribution tells us that there's a higher probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculations**

1. **Probability of the witness saying "taller" given the person is actually taller (True Positive):** This is 80% (from information a).

2. **Probability of the witness saying "taller" given the person is actually shorter (False Positive):** This is 20% (from information a).

3. **Probability of a person being taller than 185 cm:** This is 15% (from information b).

4. **Probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm:** This is 85% (from information b).

5. **Using Bayes' Theorem:** We can combine these probabilities to find the probability the attacker is actually taller given the witness said "taller".

    * Let:
       *  T =  The attacker is taller than 185 cm
       *  W = The witness says the attacker is taller

    * Bayes' Theorem: P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

    * We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness saying "taller" in general.  This can be done using the law of total probability:
        * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|~T) * P(~T)
        * P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

6. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
    * P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
    * P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
