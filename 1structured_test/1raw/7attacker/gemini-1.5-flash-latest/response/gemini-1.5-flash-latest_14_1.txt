Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, representing the chance of someone being that height before considering the witness's testimony.

**2. Likelihood Ratio:**

* The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller.
* The witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm.
* Therefore, the likelihood ratio (the ratio of the probability of the witness's observation given the person is tall vs. given the person is short) is 80% / 20% = 4. This means the witness's testimony makes it four times more likely the person was tall, compared to being short.

**3. Posterior Probability:**

* We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony.  The formula is:

   Posterior Probability = (Likelihood Ratio * Prior Probability) / [(Likelihood Ratio * Prior Probability) + (1 - Prior Probability)]

* Plugging in our values:

   Posterior Probability = (4 * 0.15) / [(4 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.15)] 
   Posterior Probability = 0.6 / 0.85
   Posterior Probability â‰ˆ 0.706

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.706} 

**Explanation:**  Based on the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.706 (or 70.6%).
