Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to combine the information from the witness (a) with the population data (b) to estimate the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): The prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying to Our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's plug in the information:

* **P(A):**  This is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From (b), we know P(A) = 0.15.
* **P(B|A):** This is the probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are. From (a), we know P(B|A) = 0.80.
* **P(B):** This is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated as follows:

* **P(B|A) * P(A):**  0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (Probability of witness correctly identifying someone as tall and them actually being tall)
* **P(B|not A) * P(not A):**  0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying someone as tall and them actually being short)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138}
