Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good identifier of height, but they're not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.  
* **Information b:** The attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, as 85% of the population is.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation is ideal for Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A.
* P(B): The prior probability of event B.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Now, let's plug in the values:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are. This is 80% or 0.8 (from information a).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15 (from information b).
* **P(B):**  The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter. This is 20% or 0.2 (from information a).
    * P(not A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85 (from information b).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Finally, let's calculate P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
