Here's how to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability:** We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from statement "a"). This is our prior probability.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time (from statement "b"). This is our likelihood.

To find the posterior probability (the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement), we can use Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)
```

Let's break it down:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):**  This is the posterior probability we want to find.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the likelihood, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability, which is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. To calculate this, we need to consider both scenarios: 
    * The witness correctly identifies a tall person (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
    * The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                     = 0.12 / 0.29 
                                     â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
