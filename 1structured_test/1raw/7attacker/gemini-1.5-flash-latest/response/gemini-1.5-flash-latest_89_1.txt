Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  We have a witness who's not perfect, but their accuracy is known. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning they're likely to be right about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:**  This tells us the overall population distribution of heights.  Since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this means the attacker is statistically more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness's observation with the population distribution.

Let's define:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the population proportion of 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
