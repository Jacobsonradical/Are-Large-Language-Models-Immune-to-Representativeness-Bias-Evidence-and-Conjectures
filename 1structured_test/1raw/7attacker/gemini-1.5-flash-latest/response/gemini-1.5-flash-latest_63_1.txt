Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in judging height, but their assessment is not perfect.
* **Population Statistics:**  We know the distribution of heights in the city.

We need to combine these pieces to estimate the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Now, let's plug in the values:**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are is 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter is 0.2 (the witness is wrong 20% of the time).
* **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (given in the problem).

**We need to calculate P(B) to use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
