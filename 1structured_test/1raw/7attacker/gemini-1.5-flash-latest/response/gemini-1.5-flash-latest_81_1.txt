Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city.  15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability.  They are accurate 80% of the time, but 20% of the time they misjudge height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is a classic example of using Bayes' Theorem to update our belief based on new evidence.  

* **Let's define events:**
    * **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    * **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find:** P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

* **Bayes' Theorem:**
    P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the city's population.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both true positives (correctly identifying someone tall) and false positives (incorrectly identifying someone short).

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, 20%.
* **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**In conclusion, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is estimated to be 0.48 or 48%.**
