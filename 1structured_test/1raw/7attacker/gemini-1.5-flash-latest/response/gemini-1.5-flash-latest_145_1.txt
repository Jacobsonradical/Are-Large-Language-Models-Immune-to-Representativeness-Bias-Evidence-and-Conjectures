Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are not.

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**To find P(B), we need the law of total probability:**

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 
     = 0.34
```

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34 
       = 0.353 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353}
