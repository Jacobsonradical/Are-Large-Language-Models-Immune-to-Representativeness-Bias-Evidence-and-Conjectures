Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **a:**  The witness has a good track record (80% accuracy) but there's a chance they were wrong. 
* **b:**  This tells us the overall prevalence of heights in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker being tall) given new evidence (witness testimony).

Let:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall, given the attacker IS tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 0.8
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the population prevalence: 0.15
* **P(W):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of actual height). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
