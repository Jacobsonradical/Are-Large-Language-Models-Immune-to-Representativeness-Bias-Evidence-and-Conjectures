Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.
* **b:**  The city has a specific distribution of heights.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This scenario is ideal for using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated. 

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness *incorrectly* identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (given they are shorter). This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** The probability someone in the city is *shorter* than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we have all the pieces:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
