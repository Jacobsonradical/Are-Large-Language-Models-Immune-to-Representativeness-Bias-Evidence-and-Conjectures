Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good estimator of height, but they make mistakes.  
* **Information b:**  The city's population has a relatively low proportion of people taller than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem lends itself well to Bayes' Theorem.  We want to find the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony. 

Let:

* **T:** The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller)
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as tall

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|T):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(T):**  Prior probability the attacker is tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on the population distribution.
* **P(W):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  = 0.4615 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Interpretation**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 46.15%.  The witness's testimony increases the probability from the baseline population percentage of 15%, but it's important to remember the witness is not perfect.
