Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information "a":** The witness is a good judge of height, but they're not perfect. They are correct 80% of the time.
* **Information "b":** This tells us the overall distribution of heights in the city. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define some events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is tall, which is the proportion of the population that's tall, 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (regardless of their actual height).  We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(W)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(W|not A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they are not actually tall. This is the witness's error rate, 0.2.
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is not tall, 0.85 (from information "b").

So:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
