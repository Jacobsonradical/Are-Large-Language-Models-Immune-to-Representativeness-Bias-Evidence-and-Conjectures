Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution of the city's population.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability in judging height. It tells us the witness is correct 80% of the time, even under challenging conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves a conditional probability, meaning we want to know the probability of the attacker being tall *given* the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem is the perfect tool for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is tall) given event B (witness says they are tall)
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall (this is the witness's accuracy, 80%)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from information a)
* P(B) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall (we'll calculate this below)

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider both cases:

* **Case 1: Attacker is tall:**  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 
* **Case 2: Attacker is not tall:** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
