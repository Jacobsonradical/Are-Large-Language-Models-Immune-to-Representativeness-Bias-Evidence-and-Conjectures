Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city. 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, but are wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the general population proportion, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
