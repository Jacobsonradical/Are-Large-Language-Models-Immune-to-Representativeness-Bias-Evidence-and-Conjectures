Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

**We know:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are that tall.
* **P(B|~A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city.
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the city.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
