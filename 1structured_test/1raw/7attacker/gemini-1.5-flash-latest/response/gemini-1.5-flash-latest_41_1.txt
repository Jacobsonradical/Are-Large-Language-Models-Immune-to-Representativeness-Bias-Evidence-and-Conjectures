Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is likely to be accurate about the attacker's height, but there's a chance they are wrong.
* **Population Statistics:** The majority of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine these pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm.

**Solution**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this probability:

* **P(A|B):** Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually taller than 185 cm. This is 80% (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from the population statistics).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is a bit more complex to calculate, but we can use the Law of Total Probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

* **P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12** (Witness is correct, and attacker is tall)
* **P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17** (Witness is incorrect, and attacker is short)

**P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
