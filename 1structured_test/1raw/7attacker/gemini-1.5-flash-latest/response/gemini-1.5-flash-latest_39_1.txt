Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Provides the general height distribution in the city.
* **Information b:** Tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height and how reliable their testimony is.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):**  This is what we want to find – the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness said they were tall.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy, given by information b (80%).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of a person being tall in the city, given by information a (15%).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying "tall" regardless of the attacker's actual height. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(Witness Says Tall):**

To find P(Witness Says Tall), we need to consider both cases:

* **Case 1: Attacker is Tall:**  The witness correctly identifies them as tall with 80% probability (0.8).
* **Case 2: Attacker is Short:** The witness incorrectly identifies them as tall with 20% probability (0.2).

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(Witness Says Tall):

P(Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] + [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]

P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Putting it all together:**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 ≈ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
