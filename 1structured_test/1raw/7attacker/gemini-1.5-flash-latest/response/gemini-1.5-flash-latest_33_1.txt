Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in identifying height, but their judgment is not perfect.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the percentage of the population that falls into each height category.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:

*  **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

**P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)**

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they *actually* are that tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the population proportion of 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* that tall. This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48} 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.48**.
