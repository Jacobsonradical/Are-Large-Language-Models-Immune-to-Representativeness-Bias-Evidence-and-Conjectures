Here's how we can calculate the probability:

* **Prior probability:** We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. This is our likelihood.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

**Posterior probability = (Likelihood * Prior probability) / (Likelihood * Prior probability + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior probability))**

Let's plug in the numbers:

* Posterior probability = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
* Posterior probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* Posterior probability = 0.12 / 0.29
* Posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.414

**{probability: 0.414}**

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
