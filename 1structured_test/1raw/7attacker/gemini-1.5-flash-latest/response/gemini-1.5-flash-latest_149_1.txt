Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city.
* **Fact b:**  Provides information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.  

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation calls for Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): The probability of event B happening.

**Defining Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  From fact a, we know P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
* **P(B|A):** From fact b, the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they actually are that height. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
* **P(B|not A):**  From fact b, the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if they are actually shorter than 185 cm. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.
* **P(not A):**  Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, 85% are shorter.  Therefore, P(not A) = 0.85.

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
