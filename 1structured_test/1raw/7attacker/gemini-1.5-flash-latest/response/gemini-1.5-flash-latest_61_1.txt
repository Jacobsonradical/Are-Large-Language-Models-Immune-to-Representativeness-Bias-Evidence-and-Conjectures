Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine these pieces of information. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Prior Probability:**  The initial probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% (given by information a).

2. **Likelihood:**  The witness is correct 80% of the time. This means:
    * If the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller, the witness has an 80% chance of identifying them correctly.
    * If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness has an 80% chance of identifying them as shorter (and a 20% chance of incorrectly saying they are taller).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's statement.  The formula is:

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

   Where:
    * P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's statement (B).
    * P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying someone correctly (80%) given they are actually 185 cm or taller.
    * P(A) is the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller (15%).
    * P(B) is the overall probability of the witness making that statement. 

4. **Calculating P(B):**  To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker is actually tall (185 cm or taller): The probability of the witness saying "tall" is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (80% accuracy * 15% prior probability).
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is actually short: The probability of the witness saying "tall" is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate * 85% prior probability).

    Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

5. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

    P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says "tall") =  (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 =  0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's statement and the information about height distribution and witness accuracy, we estimate a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
