Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  Tells us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Fact b:** Provides information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was tall, given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identified the attacker as tall, *given* the attacker was actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from fact b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (from fact a).
* **P(B):**  The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identified the attacker as tall, *given* the attacker was *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (from fact b).
* **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker not being tall, which is 85% (from fact a).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
