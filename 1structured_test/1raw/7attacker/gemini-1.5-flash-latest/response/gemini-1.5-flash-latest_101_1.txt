Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Information from the Problem**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population distribution, is 0.15.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually that height is 0.80 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.20 (20% error rate).

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

where P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
```

**4. Calculations**

* **P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85** (The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**

**5.  Estimate of Probability**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.**
