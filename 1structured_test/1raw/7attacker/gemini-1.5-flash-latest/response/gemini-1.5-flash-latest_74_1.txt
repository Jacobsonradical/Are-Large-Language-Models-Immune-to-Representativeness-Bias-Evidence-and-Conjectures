Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies a tall person (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (20% error).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30 
P(A|B) = 0.4
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
