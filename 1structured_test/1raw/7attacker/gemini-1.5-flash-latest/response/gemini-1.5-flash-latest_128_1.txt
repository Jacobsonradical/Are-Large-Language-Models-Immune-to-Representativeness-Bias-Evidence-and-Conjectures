Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable in judging height (80% accuracy), but there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:** The city's population distribution gives us a baseline probability of an individual being 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony:

* **P(A|B):**  Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's statement (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% from the population distribution).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the witness's testimony and the city's population distribution, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
