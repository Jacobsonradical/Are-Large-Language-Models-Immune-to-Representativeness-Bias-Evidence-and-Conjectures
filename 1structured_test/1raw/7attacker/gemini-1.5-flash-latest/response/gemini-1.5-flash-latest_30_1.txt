Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Given Information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from "b").
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (from "a").
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (from "a").

**3.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**4. Calculate:**

* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**
* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
