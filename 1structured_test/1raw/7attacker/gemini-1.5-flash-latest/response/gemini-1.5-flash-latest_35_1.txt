Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general population distribution of heights in the city.
* **Information b:** This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying heights, but under specific conditions.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information to estimate the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% (from information a).

2. **Likelihood:**  The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually that height, is 80% (from information b).

3. **Likelihood of False Identification:** The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 20% (from information b).

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:** Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief (the 15% probability) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

   Let:
   *  A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
   *  B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

   Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

   Where:
   *  P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
   *  P(B|A) = Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as tall, given they are actually tall (80%).
   *  P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15%).
   *  P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (we need to calculate this).

5. **Calculating P(B):** 
   We need to consider both cases: the witness correctly identifying a tall person and incorrectly identifying a shorter person.
   *  P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
   *  P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

6. **Putting it all together:**
   *  P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
   *  P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
