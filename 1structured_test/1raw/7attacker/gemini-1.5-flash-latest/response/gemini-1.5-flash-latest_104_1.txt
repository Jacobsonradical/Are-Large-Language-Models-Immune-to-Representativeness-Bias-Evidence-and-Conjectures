Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height, but we don't know if they correctly identified the attacker's height or not.
* **Population Distribution:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability the attacker was actually tall.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.  In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

**Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker IS tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from population distribution).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* **Scenario 1:** Witness is correct (attacker is tall): P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** Witness is wrong (attacker is short): P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 

P(B) is the sum of these scenarios: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, our estimate is that there is a 41.38% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.**
