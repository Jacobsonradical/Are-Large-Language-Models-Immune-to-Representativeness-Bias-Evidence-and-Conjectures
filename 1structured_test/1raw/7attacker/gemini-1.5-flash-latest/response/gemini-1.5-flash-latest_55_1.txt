Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.  We have information about:

* **Prior probability:** The probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone's height (80% for taller individuals, 20% for shorter individuals).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's identification.

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being tall is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as tall given they are tall is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as tall given they are not tall is 0.2 (20%).
* **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker not being tall is 0.85 (85%).

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
