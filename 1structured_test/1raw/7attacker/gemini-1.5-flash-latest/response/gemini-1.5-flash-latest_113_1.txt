Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population distribution of heights.  This is a classic example of Bayes' Theorem.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's break down the terms in Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(A|B):**  This is what we want to find - the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are 185 cm or taller. This is 80% (from the information provided).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from the population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier to calculate but we can use the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall in two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The person is actually tall (185 cm or taller).** The probability of this scenario is P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **Scenario 2: The person is actually short (shorter than 185 cm).** The probability of this scenario is P(~A) * P(B|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

* P(~A) is the probability of the person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (1-0.15)
* P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall, which is 20%

**Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Putting it All Together**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
