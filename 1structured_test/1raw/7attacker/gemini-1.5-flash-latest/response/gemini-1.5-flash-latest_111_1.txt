Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given that the witness identified them as tall.  We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (based on population statistics) with the new information from the witness.

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability (P(Tall)):** The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is tall (185 cm or taller). From information "a", this is 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Tall | Tall)):** The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given they *are* actually tall. From information "b", this is 0.80.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Says Tall | Not Tall)):** The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are *not* tall. From information "b", this is 0.20.
* **Posterior Probability (P(Tall | Witness Says Tall)):** The probability that someone is tall given the witness identified them as tall. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Where:

* P(Witness Says Tall) is the overall probability that the witness says someone is tall. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(Witness Says Tall):**
   P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
