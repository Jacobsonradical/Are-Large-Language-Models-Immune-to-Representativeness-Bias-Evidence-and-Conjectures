Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general prevalence of heights in the city. However, this information alone isn't enough to determine the attacker's height.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the population distribution to get a more accurate probability. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be helpful. However, for a simplified explanation, let's think about it intuitively:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is actually tall (185cm or taller)** 
   * There's an 80% chance the witness correctly identifies them as tall.

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is actually short (shorter than 185cm)**
   * There's a 20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall.

Since the witness said "tall", we need to focus on the likelihood of each scenario leading to that testimony.  While we don't know the attacker's actual height, we know it's more likely someone in that city is short (85%) than tall (15%).

**Estimating the Probability**

Given the higher prevalence of shorter people and the witness's chance of error, it's more likely the witness encountered a shorter person and misidentified their height. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller is **lower** than the witness's accuracy (80%) but likely **higher** than the general population prevalence (15%). 

**Providing an Estimate**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without using Bayes' Theorem. However, a reasonable estimate, considering the factors discussed, would be somewhere between 0.25 and 0.50. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.35}
