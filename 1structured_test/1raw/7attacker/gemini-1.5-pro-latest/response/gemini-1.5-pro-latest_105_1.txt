Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from information "a"):**  The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15. This is our starting point before considering the witness testimony.

* **Witness Reliability (from information "b"):** The witness is not perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions. This means:
    *  If the attacker *was* 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them.
    * If the attacker *wasn't* 185cm or taller, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as being that height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem gives us a way to update our initial belief (prior probability) with new evidence (witness testimony) to arrive at a more accurate probability. 

Let:

*  Event A = Attacker is 185cm or taller 
*  Event B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* that the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that height (this is 0.80).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (this is 0.15).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be a bit tricky.  The witness can say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1. The attacker *is* that tall, and the witness is correct.
2. The attacker *isn't* that tall, and the witness is incorrect.

So:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)]  +  [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

Where:

* P(B| not A) = Probability the witness says "185cm or taller" given the attacker is *shorter*. This is 0.20 (the error rate).
* P(not A) = Probability the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm. This is 0.85 (1 - 0.15).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Taking into account both the city's height distribution and the witness's reliability, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
