Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are right 80% of the time, and wrong 20% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us how common people taller than 185cm are in the city.  It's useful background information.

**The Key:** We need to combine the witness's testimony with the general population data to get a more accurate probability. 

**Reasoning**

Let's imagine 1000 attackers representing the city's population:

* 850 would be shorter than 185cm (85%)
* 150 would be 185cm or taller (15%)

Now, let's consider how the witness would perform if these 1000 people were the potential attackers:

* **Out of the 150 tall attackers:** The witness would correctly identify 80% of them, meaning 120 would be correctly identified as tall.
* **Out of the 850 short attackers:** The witness would incorrectly identify 20% of them as tall, meaning 170 would be wrongly identified as tall. 

**Calculating the Probability**

* The witness would identify a total of 290 people as tall (120 correctly + 170 incorrectly).
* Out of those 290, only 120 are actually tall.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller given the witness's testimony is: 

120 / 290 = approximately 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
