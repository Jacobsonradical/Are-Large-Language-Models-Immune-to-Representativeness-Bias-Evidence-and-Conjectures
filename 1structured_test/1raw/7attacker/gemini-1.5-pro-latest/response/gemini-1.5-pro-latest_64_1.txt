Here's how we can estimate the probability and format the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to combine two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability (Information "a"):** The general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (15%).
* **Witness Reliability (Information "b"):** How much weight we should give the witness's statement based on their accuracy.

**Using Bayes' Theorem (A simplified approach)**

While a precise calculation would involve Bayes' Theorem, we can approximate the answer logically:

1. **Start with the prior:** There's a 15% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller based purely on the city's population.

2. **Factor in witness accuracy:** The witness is 80% accurate.  This means they are more likely to be right than wrong. 

3. **Increase the probability, but don't make it absolute:** Since the witness is reliable, our confidence that the attacker was 185cm or taller should increase significantly from the initial 15%. However, because the witness isn't perfect, the probability shouldn't jump to 80% or higher. 

**Estimate**

A reasonable estimate, considering the witness's accuracy but acknowledging they aren't infallible, would be around:

{probability: 0.6}

**Important Notes:**

* This is a simplified estimate. A precise calculation using Bayes' Theorem would provide a more definitive answer.
* The actual probability could be influenced by other factors not provided (e.g., visibility conditions, the witness's familiarity with judging height in those specific circumstances).
