Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from "a"):**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance a random person in the city is 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Witness Reliability (from "b"):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said so)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness said so) given event A (attacker is actually 185cm or taller) = 80% (witness accuracy)
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 15% 
* P(B) = Overall probability of witness saying "185cm or taller" (this can occur in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and the witness is right, OR the attacker is shorter and the witness is wrong)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 

Where:

* P(B|~A) = Probability of the witness saying "185cm or taller" given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm = 20% (witness error rate)
* P(~A) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm = 85%

**Calculation**

1. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
2. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, considering both the city's height distribution and the witness's reliability, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller.**
