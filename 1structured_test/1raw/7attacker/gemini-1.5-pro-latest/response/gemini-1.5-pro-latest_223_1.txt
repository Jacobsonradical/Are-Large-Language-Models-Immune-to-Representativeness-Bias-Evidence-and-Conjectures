Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying someone as 185cm or taller when actually presented with someone of that height. This means they have a 20% chance of misidentifying both taller and shorter individuals. 
* **Population Distribution (b):** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller, independent of the witness testimony.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's somewhat unreliable testimony with the baseline probability from the population distribution.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be helpful. However, due to the way the witness's accuracy is presented, we can use a more intuitive approach:

1. **Consider 100 attackers:** Let's imagine there were 100 instances of this attack. Based on the city's population distribution, we'd expect roughly 15 of these attackers to be 185cm or taller, and 85 to be shorter.

2. **Apply Witness Accuracy:**
   * Out of the 15 taller attackers, the witness would correctly identify about 80% of them: 15 * 0.8 = 12
   * Out of the 85 shorter attackers, the witness would incorrectly identify about 20% of them as tall: 85 * 0.2 = 17

3. **Analyze the Results:**  The witness identifies 12 + 17 = 29 people as being 185cm or taller. However, we know that only 12 of them actually are.

4. **Calculate the Probability:** The probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller given the witness's identification is: 12 / 29 = approximately 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
