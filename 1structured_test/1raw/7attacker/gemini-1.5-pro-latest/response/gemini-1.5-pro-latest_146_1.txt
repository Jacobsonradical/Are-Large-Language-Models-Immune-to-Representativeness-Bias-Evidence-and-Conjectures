Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't definitive proof but holds valuable information.
* **Population Distribution:** This information helps us understand the baseline likelihood of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs based on new evidence.  Here's how we can apply it:

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = Probability the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller (This is 80% or 0.8).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (This is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller (This needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be thought of as the probability of the witness saying "185 cm or taller" in any scenario. There are two ways this could happen:

1. The attacker *is* 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)
2. The attacker is *shorter* than 185 cm, and the witness is incorrect (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17)

Therefore: 
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 41.4%.
