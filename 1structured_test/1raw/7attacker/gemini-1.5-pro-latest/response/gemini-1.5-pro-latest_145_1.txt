Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from information "a"):**  There's a 15% chance a random person in the city is 185cm or taller. This is our baseline before considering the witness.
* **Witness Reliability (from information "b"):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height under similar conditions. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (a way to update probabilities with new evidence)**

While we can't get an exact probability without more information, Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for thinking about this. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Start with the prior probability:** 15% (0.15) chance the attacker is 185cm or taller.

2. **Consider the witness's accuracy:**
   *  If the attacker *is* 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness correctly identified them.
   * If the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness mistakenly identified them as taller.

3. **We need to weigh these possibilities.** Since the witness said "taller," the attacker being taller becomes more likely, but we can't ignore the possibility of a mistake.

**Estimating the Probability**

Without going into complex calculations, we can make a reasonable estimate:

* The witness's testimony significantly increases the probability above the initial 15%. 
* However, the 20% error rate means it's not a certainty.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller is likely somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8.**

**{probability: 0.65}**  (This is an approximate midpoint and not an exact calculation) 

**Important Note:**  A more precise calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem formula and potentially considering other factors (e.g., prevalence of similar lighting conditions in the city).
