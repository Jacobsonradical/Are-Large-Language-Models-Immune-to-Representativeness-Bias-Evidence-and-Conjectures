Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from 'a'):**  There's a 15% chance a random person in the city is 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Witness Reliability (from 'b'):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony).  However, for a simplified explanation:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is 185cm or taller.** 
   * There's a 15% chance of this being true.
   * If true, the witness would identify them correctly 80% of the time.

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185cm.**
   * There's an 85% chance of this being true.
   * If true, the witness would incorrectly identify them as taller 20% of the time.

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without a more complex calculation. However, we can make a qualitative estimate:

* The witness's testimony significantly increases the likelihood that the attacker was 185cm or taller. This is because their accuracy rate (80%) is much higher than the base rate of people being that height (15%). 

**Therefore, while we cannot give a precise number, the probability is significantly higher than 15% but likely not as high as 80%.**

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A precise calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem and might consider factors like the prevalence of crime among different height groups (which we don't have).
