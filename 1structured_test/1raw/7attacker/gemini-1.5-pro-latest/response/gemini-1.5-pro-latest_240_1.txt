Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

*  Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as taller 20% of the time)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
