Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height but gives us a measure of the witness's testimony accuracy.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us that tall people (185cm or taller) are less common in the city. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best tackled using Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's define the events:

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the witness said they were.

Here's how the terms break down:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall *given* the attacker actually is tall. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 0.15 (15% of the population).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall (regardless of actual height).  This has two components:
    *  The attacker is tall, and the witness is right: P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    *  The attacker is short, but the witness is wrong: P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
    *  Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
         â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and population distribution, is approximately 41.4%. It's important to note that this is still significantly influenced by the fact that tall people are less common in the city.
