Here's how we can estimate the probability, combining both pieces of information:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** The information in point "a" gives us the base rate of people taller than 185cm in the city (15%). This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Reliability:** Point "b" tells us the witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being correct about someone's height in similar conditions. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this situation. It helps us update our prior belief (15% chance attacker is tall) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's break it down:

* **Event A:** The attacker is actually 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B):** the probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the witness said they were.

Bayes' Theorem states:

**P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)**

Let's plug in what we know:

* **P(B|A):** If the attacker *is* tall, the witness has an 80% chance of saying so (from point "b"). So, P(B|A) = 0.8 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall is 15% (from point "a"). So, P(A) = 0.15
* **P(B):** This is the probability the witness would say "tall" regardless of the actual height.  We need to consider both scenarios:
    * Attacker is tall, and witness is right: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * Attacker is short, and witness is wrong: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
    * Adding these gives us P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
