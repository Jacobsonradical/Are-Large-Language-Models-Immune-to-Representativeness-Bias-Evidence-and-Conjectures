Here's how we can approach this problem, combining witness testimony with population data:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update the prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller (based on the city's population) with the witness's testimony. This involves Bayesian reasoning.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm = 0.85 (85%)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of witness correctly identifying attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall = 0.80 (80%) 
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of witness incorrectly identifying attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually shorter = 0.20 (20%)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B):** Probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller *given* the witness identified them as tall.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B)** = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B)** = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
