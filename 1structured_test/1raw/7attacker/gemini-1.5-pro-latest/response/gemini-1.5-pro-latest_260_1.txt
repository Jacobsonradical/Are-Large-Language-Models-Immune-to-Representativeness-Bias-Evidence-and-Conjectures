Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):** This tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. 
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect.  They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior belief (the 15% chance) with new evidence (the witness testimony) to get a more accurate probability.

However, applying Bayes' Theorem directly is tricky here without knowing how often the witness *incorrectly* identifies someone as 185cm or taller when they are actually shorter. 

**Making an Assumption & Estimating**

Let's assume the witness's error rate is evenly distributed: they are equally likely to mistake someone shorter for someone taller, and vice versa. 

* They correctly identify 80% of people taller than 185cm.
* They incorrectly identify 10% of people shorter than 185cm as being taller (20% total error, split evenly).

Given this assumption, here's a simplified way to think about it:

1. **Out of 100 people in the city:**
   *  15 are 185cm or taller.
   *  85 are shorter than 185cm.

2. **The witness would likely identify:**
   *  12 of the taller group correctly (15 * 0.8 = 12)
   *  8.5 of the shorter group incorrectly as taller (85 * 0.1 = 8.5)

3. **The probability the attacker is actually tall, given the witness said they were:** 
    * 12 / (12 + 8.5) = approximately 0.585 

**Important Note:** This estimate relies on our assumption about the witness's error distribution. If they are more prone to thinking people are taller than they are, the probability would be lower.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.585}
