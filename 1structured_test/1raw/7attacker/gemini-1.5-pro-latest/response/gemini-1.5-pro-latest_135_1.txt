Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy for this specific case.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate for this specific case.
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a random person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller (regardless of if they actually are), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of tall people in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
