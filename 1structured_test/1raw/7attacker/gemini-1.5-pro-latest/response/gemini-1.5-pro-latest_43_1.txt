Here's how we can approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement has value, but it's not perfect.
* **Population Distribution (b):**  This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. 

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can help us update our belief based on new evidence.

**Let's Define Events:**

*  **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**What We Need to Calculate:**

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is 185cm+ *given* the attacker actually is 185cm+ (This is the witness's accuracy for identifying tall people, which is 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm+ (This is 15% or 0.15 from the population data).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would identify someone as 185cm+ (This needs further calculation).

**Calculating P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) by considering both scenarios that would lead the witness to say "185cm or taller":

1. **The attacker is actually tall, and the witness is correct:** P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **The attacker is not tall, but the witness is wrong:** P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Therefore:
   P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation:**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
        = 0.4138 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness testimony and the city's population height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.
