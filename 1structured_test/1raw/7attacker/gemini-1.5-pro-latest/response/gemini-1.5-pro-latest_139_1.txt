Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from 'a'):**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (from 'b'):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for updating probabilities with new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
* P(A):  Prior probability of event A.
* P(B):  Prior probability of event B.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**Calculating the Pieces**

* P(A): 0.15 (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* P(B|A): 0.80 (Witness's accuracy when the person is actually 185cm or taller)
* P(B| not A): 0.20 (Witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185cm)
* P(not A): 0.85 (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)

To get P(B), we use the law of total probability:
* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B| not A) * P(not A) 
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller. It's important to note that this is still significantly higher than the initial 15% probability before considering the witness.
