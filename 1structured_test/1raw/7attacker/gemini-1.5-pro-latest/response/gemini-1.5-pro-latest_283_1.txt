Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Distribution (b):**  This tells us that tall people (185cm or taller) are relatively less common in the city.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine both pieces of information. It's tempting to say there's an 80% chance the attacker is tall because of the witness. However, the low percentage of tall people in the city makes this less likely. 

**Think of it this way:**

Imagine the witness sees 100 random people from the city at night. 

* Statistically, around 15 of them would be 185cm or taller, and 85 would be shorter.
* Out of the 15 tall people, the witness would likely identify 80% correctly (12 people) and misidentify 20% (3 people).
* Out of the 85 shorter people, the witness would misidentify 20% (17 people) as tall.

So, the witness would identify about 29 people (12 correctly identified tall people + 17 incorrectly identified shorter people) as being 185cm or taller, even though only 12 actually are.

**Calculating the Probability**

To get the probability the attacker is actually tall given the witness said so, we use:

Probability = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)

* **True Positives:** Witness correctly identifies a tall person (12)
* **False Positives:** Witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (17)

Probability = 12 / (12 + 17) = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A more accurate calculation might involve Bayesian reasoning, which considers prior probabilities (the population distribution) and updates them based on new evidence (witness testimony).
