Here's how we can approach this problem, combining the witness testimony with the population data:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Distribution:**  Most people in the city (85%) are shorter than 185cm. This is important background information.

**Reasoning**

We need to find a balance between the witness testimony (which suggests the attacker is likely taller) and the population distribution (which suggests taller people are less common).

* **If we solely relied on the witness:** We'd say there's an 80% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **If we solely relied on population:** We'd say there's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller.

However, we need to consider both. The witness testimony makes it *more likely* the attacker is taller than the general population average, but it's not guaranteed. 

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without more sophisticated statistical analysis (like using Bayesian reasoning). However, we can make a reasonable estimate:

The witness testimony significantly increases the likelihood above the population average of 15%.  However, since the witness isn't perfect, the probability wouldn't be as high as 80%.

A reasonable estimate might be somewhere between 50% and 70%, leaning closer to the higher end due to the witness testimony.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.65} 

**Important Note:** This is an educated estimate. A more accurate calculation would require applying Bayesian analysis to formally combine the evidence.
