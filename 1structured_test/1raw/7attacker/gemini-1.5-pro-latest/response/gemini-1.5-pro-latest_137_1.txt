Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they have a higher chance of being right than wrong about the attacker's height.
* **Population Distribution:** This information tells us that taller people (185cm or more) are less common in the city.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the general population statistics to get a more accurate estimate. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied. However, for a simpler explanation, we'll use a more intuitive approach:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm or taller**
   * There's a 15% chance the attacker is actually this tall (from population data).
   * If they are this tall, there's an 80% chance the witness is correct. 
   * So, the probability of this scenario is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker IS NOT 185cm or taller**
   * There's an 85% chance the attacker is actually shorter (from population data).
   * If they are shorter, there's a 20% chance the witness is incorrect (and thus said they were taller).
   * So, the probability of this scenario is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

3. **Calculating the Overall Probability**
   * We now have two probabilities:
      * 0.12 (Probability the attacker is tall AND the witness is right)
      * 0.17 (Probability the attacker is short AND the witness is wrong)
   * To find the probability that the attacker is actually tall, we need to consider both scenarios:
     * Total probability of the witness saying "tall" = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     * Out of this, the proportion representing a truly tall attacker is 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A more precise calculation using Bayes' Theorem would likely yield a slightly different result. However, the approach outlined here captures the core logic of combining witness testimony with population data.
