Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

* Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's statement.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the witness correctly identifies height when the attacker *is* actually 185 cm or taller (sensitivity).
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies height when the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (false positive rate). 
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

Where P(B) can be calculated as:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculation:**

1. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.**
