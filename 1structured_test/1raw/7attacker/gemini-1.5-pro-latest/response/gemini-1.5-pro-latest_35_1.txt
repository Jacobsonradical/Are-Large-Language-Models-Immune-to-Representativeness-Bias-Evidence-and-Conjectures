Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's height (based on the city's height distribution) with new information from the witness.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies height given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8). 
* **P(B| not A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

**Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification (what we want to find).
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B| not A) * P(not A)
```

```
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
```

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
```

```
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's testimony and the city's height distribution, there's an estimated 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
