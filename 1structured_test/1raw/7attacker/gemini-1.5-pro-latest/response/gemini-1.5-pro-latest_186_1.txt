Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  This tells us that in the general population of the city, there's a 15% chance a random person would be 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior belief (15%) with new evidence (witness testimony) to get a more accurate probability.

However, directly applying Bayes' Theorem is tricky here without knowing how often the witness incorrectly identifies someone as taller when they are actually shorter. 

**Simplified Approach and Assumptions**

We'll make a simplifying assumption: the witness's error rate is equally distributed. This means they are equally likely to mistake a shorter person as tall and a tall person as short. 

With this assumption, we can reason as follows:

1. **Of the 15% of the population who are actually 185cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify 80% of them.**  This is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

2. **Of the 85% of the population who are shorter than 185cm, the witness would incorrectly identify 20% of them as being 185cm or taller.** This is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

3. **The witness claiming someone is 185cm or taller could be due to two reasons:** They were right (0.12 probability), or they were wrong (0.17 probability).

4. **The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the proportion of correct identifications out of all cases where the witness claims 185cm or taller.** This is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** This estimate heavily relies on our simplifying assumption about the witness's error distribution.  In reality, this is likely more nuanced. For a more accurate calculation, we'd need more information about the witness's error rates in different situations.
