Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to revise our prior belief (the population's height distribution) with new evidence (the witness testimony) to get a more accurate estimate of the attacker's height.

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (80%)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (20%)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness said they were.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To calculate the denominator, `P(B)`, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   ```
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
   ```

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   ```
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414
   ```

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "probability": 0.414 
}
```

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the population's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.  Keep in mind this is still a relatively low probability, and other evidence would be needed to strengthen the case.
