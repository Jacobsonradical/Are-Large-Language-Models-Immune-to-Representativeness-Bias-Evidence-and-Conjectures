Here's how we can approach this problem, combining witness testimony with population statistics:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Base Rate:** The population information (b) gives us the base rate of people being 185cm or taller in the city (15%).
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness testimony (a) provides evidence, but it's not perfect (80% accuracy).

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is helpful for updating probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said so).
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness said so) given event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 80% 
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 15%
* P(B) = Probability of event B (witness said so).  This needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

The witness can say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1. **Correctly:** Attacker is actually tall, and they identify correctly (0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12)
2. **Incorrectly:** Attacker is short, but they misidentify (0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17)

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have everything for Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

While the witness's testimony provides some evidence, the relatively low base rate of tall people in the population means the overall probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is still moderate, around 41.4%.
