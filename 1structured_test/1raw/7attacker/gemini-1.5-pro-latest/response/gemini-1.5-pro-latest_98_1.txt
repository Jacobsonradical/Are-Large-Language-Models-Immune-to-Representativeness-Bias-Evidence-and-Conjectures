Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height in similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong about the attacker being 185cm or taller.
* **Population Distribution:** Only 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This means a randomly chosen person from the city is less likely to be that tall.

**Combining the Information**

We need to weigh both pieces of information to arrive at an estimate.  Here's one way to think about it:

* **Scenario 1: The witness is right.** If the witness is right, there's a high chance (80%) the attacker is indeed tall. 
* **Scenario 2: The witness is wrong.** If the witness is wrong, and the attacker is NOT tall, there's still a 15% chance we'd find someone of that height by random chance in the city.

Since the witness is more likely to be right than wrong (80% vs. 20%), our estimate should lean more towards the attacker being tall. However, it can't be as high as 80% because of the low probability of finding someone that tall in the general population.

**Estimation**

It's difficult to give a precise probability without using a more formal Bayesian approach. However, considering the information, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the population average but lower than the witness's accuracy:

{probability: 0.6} 

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified estimation.  A more accurate probability would require a Bayesian analysis that formally combines the witness's reliability with the population distribution.
