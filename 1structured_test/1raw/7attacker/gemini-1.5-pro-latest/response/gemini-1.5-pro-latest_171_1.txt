Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us that taller people (185cm+) are less common in the city.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine both pieces of information. While the witness believes the attacker was taller, we have to consider that they might be mistaken, especially since taller people are statistically less likely in this city.

**Calculating the Probability (Using Bayes' Theorem)**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Let "Taller" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.**
* **Let "Witness Says Taller" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.**

We want to find: **P(Taller | Witness Says Taller)** (The probability the attacker is taller *given* the witness said so)

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(Taller | Witness Says Taller) = [P(Witness Says Taller | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness Says Taller)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Witness Says Taller | Taller) = 0.8** (The witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time) 
* **P(Taller) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(Witness Says Taller)** is more complex.  The witness might say "taller" if the person is actually taller, or mistakenly say "taller" if the person is shorter. We can calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(Witness Says Taller) = [P(Witness Says Taller | Taller) * P(Taller)] + [P(Witness Says Taller | Not Taller) * P(Not Taller)]
    * P(Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(Taller | Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller, considering both the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, is approximately 41.4%. It's important to note that this is still significantly lower than the witness's accuracy (80%) alone, due to the influence of the population's height distribution.
