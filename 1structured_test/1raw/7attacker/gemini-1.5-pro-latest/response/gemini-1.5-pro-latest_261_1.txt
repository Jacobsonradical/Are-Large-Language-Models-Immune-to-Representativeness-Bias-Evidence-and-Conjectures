Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The baseline likelihood of something occurring before considering any new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **Likelihood Ratio:**  A measure of how much more likely the evidence is if the hypothesis is true, compared to if the hypothesis is false. Here, the likelihood ratio is about the witness's accuracy.
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of the hypothesis being true, after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**2.  Calculating the Likelihood Ratio**

* **Sensitivity:** The witness's ability to correctly identify someone as 185cm or taller when they actually are (80%).
* **Specificity:** The witness's ability to correctly identify someone as shorter than 185cm when they actually are (also 80%).
* **False Positive Rate:** The chance of the witness saying someone is 185cm or taller when they are actually shorter (100% - Specificity = 20%).

The likelihood ratio is the sensitivity divided by the false positive rate: 80% / 20% = 4.  This means the evidence (the witness testimony) is four times more likely if the attacker is truly 185cm or taller than if they are shorter.

**3.  Applying Bayes' Theorem (A Simplified Approach)**

Bayes' Theorem is the formal way to calculate posterior probability. However, we can estimate it more intuitively:

* **Start with the prior:** 15% of the population is 185cm or taller.
* **The witness's testimony makes it 4 times more likely that the attacker is in that taller group.**  While we don't have exact numbers, imagine dividing the city's population into groups based on height. The group representing those 185cm or taller would be made "four times larger" due to the witness's statement.
* **This doesn't give us a precise probability**, but it significantly increases the likelihood that the attacker was 185cm or taller compared to the baseline 15% chance. 

**Therefore, while we cannot calculate the exact probability, we can confidently say:**

```json
{
"probability": "Significantly higher than 0.15 (15%), likely closer to 0.5 (50%) or higher." 
}
``` 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a simplified explanation. A precise calculation would require a more formal application of Bayes' Theorem.
* This estimate assumes the witness is reliable, and there's no other biasing information.
