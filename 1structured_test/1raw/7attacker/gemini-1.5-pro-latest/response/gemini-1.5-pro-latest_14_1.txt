Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's height (based on population statistics) with the new information from the witness.

* **Prior Probability:** The chance of a randomly chosen person in the city being 185cm or taller (from information "a") is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (from information "b") is 80% or 0.8.
* **We need to find:** The probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

* Event A = Attacker is 185cm or taller
* Event B = Witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 

Where:

* P(~A) = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185cm (1 - 0.15 = 0.85)
* P(B|~A) = Probability the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm (This would be the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2).

**Calculation**

1. **P(B)** = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B)** = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.4%.**
