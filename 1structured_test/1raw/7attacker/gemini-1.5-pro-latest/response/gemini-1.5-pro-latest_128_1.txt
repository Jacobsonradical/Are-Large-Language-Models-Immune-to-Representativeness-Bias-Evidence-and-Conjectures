Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't definitive proof but provides strong evidence.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem is helpful. However, for a simplified explanation and estimate, we can reason as follows:

* **Prior Probability:**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance (0.15) that a randomly selected person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Impact:** The witness significantly increases the likelihood.  They aren't perfect, but they are right 80% of the time. 

**Estimate**

Given the witness's strong accuracy, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller should be significantly higher than the baseline 15% but not as high as 80%. A reasonable estimate would lie somewhere between these values. 

Let's be conservative and say the witness's testimony effectively doubles the likelihood (which is a simplification). This would give us an estimated probability of 30%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.30} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. A more accurate calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem to formally incorporate the witness's accuracy rate and the population data.
