Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller. 
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (for a more formal approach)**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate updated probabilities given new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said so).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) given event A (attacker is actually 185cm or taller) = 80% or 0.8 
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller). This needs further calculation.

To calculate P(B), consider:

* The witness says "185cm or taller" correctly 80% of the time when someone is actually that height (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* The witness says "185cm or taller" incorrectly 20% of the time when someone is shorter (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Estimate**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, is approximately 41.4%.
