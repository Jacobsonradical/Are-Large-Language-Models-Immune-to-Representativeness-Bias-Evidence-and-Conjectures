Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement has weight, but it's not definitive. 
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us that taller people (185cm or above) are less common in the city.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the population distribution to get a more accurate probability.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem would be useful, but we can reason through it intuitively:

1. **Prior Probability:** Before the witness statement, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller was simply the population percentage: 15%.

2. **Witness Impact:** The witness testimony increases the likelihood that the attacker is taller. However, it's not a guaranteed increase to 80%.  We have to consider the cases where the witness might be wrong.

3. **Balancing Act:**  The final probability will be somewhere between the initial 15% and the witness's 80% accuracy.  It will be closer to 80% if taller people were extremely rare in the population (the witness's testimony would be more significant).  But since 15% of the population is that height, our adjustment won't be as drastic. 

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without using Bayes' Theorem. However, we can confidently estimate a range:

* **Lower Bound:** The probability can't be lower than the original 15% (the population distribution).
* **Upper Bound:** It's unlikely to be as high as 80% (the witness's accuracy) because taller people aren't extremely rare.

**Reasonable Estimate:** A probability somewhere between **30% and 50%** seems reasonable. The witness testimony significantly increases the likelihood, but we temper that increase with the fact that the attacker being taller was already somewhat likely based on the city's population.
