Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is accurate 80% of the time in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are not perfect but provide valuable information.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us the general prevalence of heights in the city.  It's more likely someone is shorter than 185 cm simply because that height is more common in the population.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population distribution to get a more accurate probability. This is a classic example of needing to update our beliefs based on new evidence (Bayesian reasoning).

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Prior Probability:** Before considering the witness, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is simply the population percentage: 15% or 0.15.

2. **Witness Testimony as Evidence:** The witness saying the attacker was 185cm or taller provides evidence. However, we need to consider their accuracy.

3. **Updating Our Belief:**  We can use a Bayesian approach to update our prior probability. However, calculating the exact posterior probability requires more complex calculations. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we're asked for an estimate, we can reason as follows:

* The witness's testimony significantly increases the likelihood of the attacker being tall. If they were completely accurate, we'd use their information directly (80% chance).
* However, they are only accurate 80% of the time. This means our final estimate should be lower than 80% but higher than the initial 15%.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering both the witness testimony and the population distribution, would be somewhere between 0.2 and 0.5.**  

**{probability: 0.35}** (This is a midpoint estimate, and the actual probability might be slightly higher or lower) 

**Important Note:** Without a full Bayesian calculation, we can't be precise.  This estimate highlights how the witness's testimony, even with some error, significantly impacts our belief about the attacker's height.
