Here's how we can estimate the probability and format the answer:

**Reasoning:**

We need to combine two pieces of information:

* **Prior probability:** The general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (15%). This is our baseline before considering the witness.
* **Witness reliability:** The witness isn't perfect. We know they have an 80% chance of being correct about height in similar situations.

To get a more accurate estimate, we should update the prior probability based on the witness testimony.  While we don't have enough information for a precise Bayesian calculation, we can make a reasonable estimate.

**Estimate:**

Since the witness is more likely to be right than wrong (80%), our probability estimate should be closer to 80% than the original 15%.  However, it shouldn't be as high as 80% because there's still a chance the witness is mistaken. 

A reasonable estimate, considering both the prior probability and the witness's accuracy, might be around **60-70%**. 

**Answer Format:**

```json
{
  "probability": 0.65 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. A more precise calculation would require applying Bayes' theorem and potentially considering other factors that might influence the witness's reliability in this specific situation.
