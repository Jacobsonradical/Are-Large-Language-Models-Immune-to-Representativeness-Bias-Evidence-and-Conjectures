Here's how to approach this problem, combining witness reliability and population statistics:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means there's a chance they're right about the attacker being 185cm or taller, but also a chance they're wrong.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to use a concept called Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information.  Bayes' Theorem gives us a way to update our belief about an event (attacker's height) given new evidence (witness testimony).

Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Scenarios:**
   * **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm or taller.** The witness had an 80% chance of correctly identifying this.
   * **Scenario 2: Attacker IS NOT 185cm or taller.** The witness had a 20% chance of incorrectly saying they were.

2. **Weighing the Scenarios:** We need to consider how likely each scenario is based on the population:
   * Scenario 1 has a starting probability of 0.15 (15% of the population).
   * Scenario 2 has a starting probability of 0.85 (85% of the population).

3. **Combining the Information:** While a precise Bayes' Theorem calculation is best, we can estimate:

   * The witness's testimony makes us more confident in Scenario 1 (attacker being tall) than the general population statistics would suggest. 
   * However, since the population has a much higher chance of the attacker being shorter, the witness testimony, while important, cannot completely outweigh that.

**Estimate:**

Given the relatively high percentage of the population shorter than 185cm, even with the witness testimony, it's more likely the attacker was shorter. However, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is significantly elevated from the baseline 15%.  

A reasonable estimate, without performing a full Bayesian calculation, would be somewhere between **0.3 and 0.4 (30% to 40%)**. 

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A precise calculation using Bayes' Theorem would provide a more definitive answer.
