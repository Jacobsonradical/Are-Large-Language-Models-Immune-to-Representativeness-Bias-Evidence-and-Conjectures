Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from a):**  The chance of a randomly chosen person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15. This is our starting point.
* **Witness Reliability (from b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in similar conditions.
* **We want:** The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem gives us a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B happened. 
    * In our case:  Probability the attacker is 185cm+ *given* the witness said so.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
    * In our case: Probability the witness would say 185cm+ *given* the attacker actually is 185cm+.
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening (our initial belief).
    * In our case: 0.15 (probability of someone being 185cm+ in the city).
* P(B) = Probability of event B happening (the evidence).
    * This is a bit trickier, we'll come back to it.

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A):** If the attacker IS 185cm+, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly saying so. So, P(B|A) = 0.8

2. **P(B):** This is the probability the witness would say "185cm+" regardless of the actual height. We need to consider both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm+** 
        * Probability of this scenario = 0.15 (prior probability) 
        * Probability of witness saying "185cm+" in this scenario = 0.8 
    * **Scenario 2: Attacker IS NOT 185cm+**
        * Probability of this scenario = 0.85 (1 - prior probability)
        * Probability of witness saying "185cm+" in this scenario = 0.2 (they are wrong 20% of the time)

   To get P(B), we average the probability of the witness saying "185cm+" across both scenarios:
   P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

3. **Putting it together in Bayes' Theorem:**

   P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness said so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

The probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.4%.  It's important to note that this is still significantly lower than the witness's accuracy (80%) because the prior probability of someone being that height in the city is low.
