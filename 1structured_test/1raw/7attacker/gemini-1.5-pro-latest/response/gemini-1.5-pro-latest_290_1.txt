Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are right 80% of the time, but wrong 20% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:**  This tells us how common people taller than 185 cm are in the city. It's background information.

**2. The Key Insight**

The crucial point is that the witness's identification significantly changes the probability. We can't just rely on the city's height distribution. Here's why:

* **Scenario 1: Witness says "shorter"** If the witness said the attacker was *shorter* than 185cm, we'd be more likely to believe them (80% chance they're right).  The population data would further support this, as most people are shorter.

* **Scenario 2: Witness says "taller"** This is our situation. Even though only 15% of the population is that tall, the witness's identification makes it *more likely* the attacker is indeed tall.

**3. Using Bayes' Theorem (Optional)**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update probabilities given new evidence. It's perfect for this kind of problem. However, we can reason through this without the full formula.

**4. Estimating the Probability**

Let's simplify and imagine 100 attackers matching the witness's description.

* **True Positives:** Out of these 100, the witness would correctly identify about 80% of those actually 185cm or taller.
* **False Positives:** The witness would also incorrectly identify about 20% of those *shorter* than 185cm as being tall. 

Since we don't know the exact numbers of tall and short attackers within that group of 100, we can't get a precise probability. However, because the witness is more likely to be right than wrong, and they've identified the attacker as tall, the probability is significantly higher than the 15% population average. 

**5. The Answer**

It's impossible to give an exact number without more information. However, a reasonable estimate would be significantly higher than the base rate of 15%.  A conservative estimate could be:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.5
}
```

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A more accurate calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem and accounting for the unknown proportion of individuals taller than 185cm within the group the witness narrowed down.
