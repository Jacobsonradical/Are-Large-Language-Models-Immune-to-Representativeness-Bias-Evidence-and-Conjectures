Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This means there's a chance they misidentified the attacker's height.
* **Population Distribution:** This information tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population distribution to get a more accurate estimate.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied.

**Let's break it down:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is actually 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

* **We want to find:** P(A|B) - The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness would identify the attacker as 185cm or taller *if* the attacker was actually 185cm or taller (this is 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (this is 15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) can occur in two ways:

1. **The attacker is tall, and the witness is correct:** P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **The attacker is short, and the witness is incorrect:** P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Therefore: P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the population distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller.
