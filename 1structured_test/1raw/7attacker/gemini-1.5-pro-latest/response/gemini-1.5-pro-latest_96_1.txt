Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Witness's accuracy: If the attacker is actually tall, the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Witness's error: If the attacker is not tall, the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time) 
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

Where P(B) can be calculated as:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
