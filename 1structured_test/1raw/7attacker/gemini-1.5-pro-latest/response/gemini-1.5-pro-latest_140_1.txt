Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height in similar conditions. This means they are not perfect, but their testimony carries weight.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us the general prevalence of heights in the city. However, this information alone doesn't determine the attacker's height.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the population distribution using Bayesian reasoning. Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Hypotheses:**
   * **H1:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   * **H2:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Prior Probabilities (based on population):**
   * **P(H1) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   * **P(H2) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) 

3. **Likelihood (based on witness):**
   * **P(Witness Correct | H1) = 0.8** (80% accurate if the attacker is actually tall)
   * **P(Witness Correct | H2) = 0.2** (20% chance the witness mistakenly identifies a shorter person as tall)

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem (simplified):**  We're interested in P(H1 | Witness Correct), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness said so.  We can approximate this:

    *  **Numerator:** P(H1) * P(Witness Correct | H1) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    *  **Denominator:**  (P(H1) * P(Witness Correct | H1)) + (P(H2) * P(Witness Correct | H2)) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

    *  **Approximate P(H1 | Witness Correct) =  Numerator / Denominator = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41**

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.41}

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation. A more precise Bayesian calculation would consider all possible heights, not just the two categories. Additionally, other factors not mentioned here (e.g., the witness's eyesight, lighting conditions) could influence the probability.
