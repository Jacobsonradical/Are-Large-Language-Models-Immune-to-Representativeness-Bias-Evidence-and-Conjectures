Here's how we can approach this problem, combining witness testimony with population statistics:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, given that the witness said they were. This means we're dealing with conditional probability.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is helpful here:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said they were 185cm or taller)
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness said they were 185cm or taller) given event A (attacker is actually 185cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.15 (population statistic)
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness said they were 185cm or taller). 

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases:

1. **Attacker IS 185cm or taller, and witness is RIGHT:** P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **Attacker IS SHORTER than 185cm, but witness is WRONG:** P(Witness wrong | Attacker shorter) * P(Attacker shorter) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore:
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

There's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller, given the witness testimony and population statistics. While the witness testimony provides some evidence, it's important to note that the probability is still influenced by the relatively low percentage of tall people in the city.
