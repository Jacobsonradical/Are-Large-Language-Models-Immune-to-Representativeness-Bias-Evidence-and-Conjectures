Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is right 80% of the time about someone being 185cm or taller. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height, just how often the witness is accurate.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (15%).

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's accuracy with the city's height distribution using Bayesian reasoning.  Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Scenarios:**
   * **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm+** 
      * Probability of this scenario based on population: 15% (0.15)
      * Probability witness is correct given this scenario: 80% (0.8)
   * **Scenario 2: Attacker IS NOT 185cm+**
      * Probability of this scenario based on population: 85% (0.85)
      * Probability witness is incorrect given this scenario: 20% (0.2) 

2. **Calculate Weighted Probabilities:**
   * Scenario 1 weighted probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
   * Scenario 2 weighted probability: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

3. **Normalize:** Divide each weighted probability by the sum of all weighted probabilities to get the probability of each scenario given the evidence:
   * Scenario 1 normalized: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) ≈ 0.414
   * Scenario 2 normalized: 0.17 / (0.12 + 0.17) ≈ 0.586

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation.  A more rigorous Bayesian approach would involve prior probabilities, likelihoods, and calculating a posterior probability. However, the logic and general outcome would be similar.
