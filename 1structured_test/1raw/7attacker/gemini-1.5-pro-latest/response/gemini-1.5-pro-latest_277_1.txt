Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height but gives us a measure of the witness's testimony accuracy.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This information tells us the general prevalence of heights in the city. It sets a baseline.

**Logic**

We need to combine both pieces of information.  It's more likely that the attacker belongs to the height group more prevalent in the city (shorter than 185cm). However, the witness's testimony, while not perfect, suggests a higher likelihood of the attacker being taller. 

**Calculation**

This problem requires a Bayesian approach to update our prior belief (population distribution) with the new evidence (witness testimony). However, without more precise data or a specific Bayesian model tailored to this scenario, providing an exact numerical probability is difficult.

**Estimate**

Considering the witness's 80% accuracy, it's plausible to say the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is significantly higher than the general population percentage (15%). However, it's unlikely to be as high as 80% due to the influence of the population distribution.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability might be somewhere between 30% and 50%.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "probability": 0.4 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is an educated estimate. A precise calculation would require a more formal Bayesian analysis.
