Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

* Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let "W" be the event that the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**2. State the Given Probabilities:**

* **Prior probability (from population data):**  P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **Witness reliability:**
    * P(W|T) = 0.80 (Witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
    * P(~W|T) = 0.20 (Witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)
* **We need to infer:** P(T|W) - The probability the attacker is actually tall given the witness said so.

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W) 

To find P(W), we need to consider both ways the witness could say "tall":

*  The attacker is tall, and the witness is right: P(W|T) * P(T) 
*  The attacker is not tall, and the witness is wrong: P(W|~T) * P(~T)

**Calculating P(W):**

* P(~T) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)
* P(W|~T) = 0.20 (Witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time -  the error rate)
* P(W) = (P(W|T) * P(T)) + (P(W|~T) * P(~T)) 
* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation:**

P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population data, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.**
