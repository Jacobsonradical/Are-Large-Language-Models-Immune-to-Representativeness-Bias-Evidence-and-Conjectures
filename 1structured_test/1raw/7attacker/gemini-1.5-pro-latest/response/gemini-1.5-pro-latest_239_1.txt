Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "B" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. State Probabilities**

* We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the witness's statement.
* We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the person is actually tall).
* We know P(B| not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate when the person is not tall).
* We know P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller).
* We know P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm).

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
