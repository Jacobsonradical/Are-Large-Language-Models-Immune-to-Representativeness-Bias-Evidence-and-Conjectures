Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement has weight, but it's not foolproof.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us that tall people (185cm or taller) are less common in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To combine these pieces of information and find the probability of the attacker being tall *given* the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is tall) given that event B (witness said they're tall) happened.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness said they're tall) given that event A (attacker is tall) happened = 0.8 (witness reliability)
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker is tall) = 0.15 (from population data)
* P(B) = Probability of event B (witness said they're tall).  This can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker is tall, and the witness is right.
    * The attacker is short, and the witness is wrong.

**Calculating P(B)**

* P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**In simpler terms:** There's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller, given both the witness testimony and the city's height distribution.
