Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony has weight, but it's not foolproof.
* **Population Distribution (b):**  This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. However, this is just background information and doesn't directly tell us about the attacker.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the population data.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can help, but we can reason intuitively:

* **Prior Probability:** Before the witness statement, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller was simply the population percentage: 15%.
* **Witness Impact:** The witness statement increases the likelihood that the attacker is taller. However, because they are not 100% accurate, it doesn't jump the probability to 80%.

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to give an exact numerical probability without using Bayes' Theorem. However, we can make a reasonable estimate:

* The witness is more likely to be right than wrong (80% accuracy). 
* The base rate of tall people is low (15%).

Considering this, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is likely higher than the initial 15% but significantly lower than 80%.  A reasonable estimate might be somewhere between 40% and 60%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.5} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimated range. A more precise calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem to incorporate both pieces of evidence.
