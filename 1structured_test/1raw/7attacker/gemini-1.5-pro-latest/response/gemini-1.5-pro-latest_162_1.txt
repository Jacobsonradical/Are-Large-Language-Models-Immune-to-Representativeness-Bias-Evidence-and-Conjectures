Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability:** Information "a" gives us the base rate of people taller than 185cm in the city (15%). This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Reliability:** Information "b" tells us the witness is not perfect but has some accuracy (80%) in judging height under similar conditions. 
* **Goal:** We want to combine the prior probability with the witness's testimony to get a more accurate estimate.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is ideal for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller) given event B (witness saying they are 185cm or taller).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B given event A (witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller when they actually are - this is 80% or 0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller - this is 15% or 0.15).
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both ways the witness could say "185cm or taller":

1.  The attacker is actually tall, and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)
2.  The attacker is not tall, but the witness is incorrect (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller, considering the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, is approximately 41.38%. The witness's testimony significantly increases the likelihood compared to the base rate of 15%.
