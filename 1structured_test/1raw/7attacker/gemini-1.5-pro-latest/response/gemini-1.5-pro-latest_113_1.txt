Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The initial probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** The probability that the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller *given* the person is actually 185cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood (P(B|¬A)):** The probability that the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller *given* the person is actually *shorter* than 185cm. This is 20% or 0.2 (since they are wrong 20% of the time).
* **Posterior Probability (P(A|B)):**  The updated probability we want to calculate: the chance the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

To find P(B), the probability of the witness stating someone is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.
