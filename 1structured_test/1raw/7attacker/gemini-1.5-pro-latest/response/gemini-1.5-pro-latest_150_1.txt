Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from population data):** There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our starting point.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being right about someone's height relative to 185 cm and a 20% chance of being wrong.
* **We need:** The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller *given* that the witness said they were.

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Define events:**
   *  Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   *  Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

2. **What we know:**
   *  P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller)
   *  P(~A) = 0.85 (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)
   *  P(W|A) = 0.80 (Probability witness is correct given the attacker is actually tall)
   *  P(W|~A) = 0.20 (Probability witness is incorrect given the attacker is actually short)

3. **What we want:**
   * P(A|W) -  The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] + [P(W|~A) * P(~A)] 
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally:**

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker actually being that height is only around 41.4%. This is significantly influenced by the fact that only 15% of the city's population is that tall.
