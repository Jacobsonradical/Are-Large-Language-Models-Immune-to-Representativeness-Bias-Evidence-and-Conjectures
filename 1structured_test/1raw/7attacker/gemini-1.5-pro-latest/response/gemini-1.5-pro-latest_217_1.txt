Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance a random person in the city is 185cm or taller. 
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being right about someone's height in similar situations.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is ideal for updating probabilities with new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said so).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) given event A (attacker actually is). This is 0.8 (80%).
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller). This is 0.15 (15%).
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller). This needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

The witness could say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1.  The attacker *is* that tall, and the witness is right (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12) 
2.  The attacker *isn't* that tall, and the witness is wrong (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17)

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion**

The probability the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.38%, significantly higher than the initial 15% due to the witness testimony, but still far from certain.
