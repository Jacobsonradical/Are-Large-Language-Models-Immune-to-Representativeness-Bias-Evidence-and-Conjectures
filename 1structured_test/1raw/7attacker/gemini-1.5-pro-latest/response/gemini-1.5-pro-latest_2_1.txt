Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general prevalence of heights in the city. However, this information alone isn't enough to determine the attacker's height.

**Combining the Information (Bayesian Thinking)**

We need to use Bayesian reasoning to combine the witness testimony with the population data.  Here's a simplified way to think about it:

1. **Hypotheses:**
   * **H1:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   * **H2:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Prior Probabilities (Based on Population):**
   * **P(H1):** 0.15 (15% of the population)
   * **P(H2):** 0.85 (85% of the population)

3. **Likelihood (Witness Testimony):**
   * **P(Witness says "185 cm or taller" | H1):** 0.80 (80% accurate if the attacker is actually tall)
   * **P(Witness says "185 cm or taller" | H2):** 0.20 (20% chance of error if the attacker is actually short)

**We want to find the posterior probability:** P(H1 | Witness says "185 cm or taller") -  the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's statement.

**A Simplified Calculation (Not perfectly accurate, but illustrative):**

Since the witness is more often right than wrong, and they said the attacker was tall, it's more likely that the attacker is indeed tall.  However, we can't just use the 80% accuracy directly. The relatively low prior probability of someone being tall (15%) needs to be factored in.

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher than the initial 15% (due to the witness testimony), but lower than 80% (because the witness isn't perfect and tall people are less common).**

**For a more precise calculation, you would need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, for the purpose of this question, a qualitative answer is sufficient.**

**Answer:**

{probability: between 0.15 and 0.80}
