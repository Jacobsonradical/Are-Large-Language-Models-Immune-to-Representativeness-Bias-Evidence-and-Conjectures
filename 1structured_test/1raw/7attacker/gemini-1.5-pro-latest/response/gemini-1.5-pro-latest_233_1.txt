Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being right about someone's height being 185 cm or taller in similar conditions. 
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us that tall people (185 cm or taller) are less common in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best tackled with Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probability (the chance of something happening given that something else has already happened).

Let's define the events:

* **Event A:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller *given* that the witness said they were.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that tall.  This is 0.8 (80% accuracy from the witness).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15% of the population).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This is trickier and requires considering both scenarios (attacker is tall, witness is right + attacker is short, witness is wrong):
    * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
    * Where ~A means "attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller"
    * P(B|~A) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall)
    * P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter)

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
    * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.**
