Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are right 80% of the time, but wrong 20% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us how common people taller than 185cm are in the city. It's background information.

**The Key:**  We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population distribution to get a more accurate probability.

**Here's a simplified way to think about it (not perfectly accurate, but helps with intuition):**

1. **Imagine 100 attackers:** Since 15% of the population is 185cm or taller, roughly 15 out of these 100 attackers would be in that height range.

2. **The witness's accuracy:** Out of those 15 tall attackers, the witness would correctly identify around 80% of them (80% of 15 is 12). 

3. **False positives:** The witness would also wrongly identify some shorter attackers as tall (20% of the time). We don't have enough information to calculate exactly how many false positives there would be.

**Conclusion:**

Because we don't know how many shorter people the witness would mistakenly identify as tall, we can't give a precise probability. However, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is higher than the 15% population average, due to the witness testimony. 

**Without more information (like the number of potential suspects), it's impossible to give a single probability number. **

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A more accurate calculation would involve Bayesian reasoning, which considers both the witness's accuracy and the base rate (population distribution) to update the probability.
