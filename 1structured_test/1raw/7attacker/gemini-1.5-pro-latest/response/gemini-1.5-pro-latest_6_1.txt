Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  Let "B" be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**2. State Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of a random person in the city being 185cm or taller)
*  P(~A) = 0.85 (Prior probability of a random person being shorter than 185cm)

**3. State Conditional Probabilities (Likelihood)**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm+ given the attacker is actually 185cm+)
*  P(B|~A) = 0.20 (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm+ given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is 185cm+ given the witness said they were.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
