Here's how to break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us the general prevalence of heights in the city. It's more likely someone is shorter than 185cm based on the population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is useful for updating probabilities based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Let Event A be "The attacker is 185cm or taller."**
* **Let Event B be "The witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller."**

We want to find **P(A|B):** the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* that the witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness would identify the attacker as 185cm or taller *if* the attacker was actually 185cm or taller (this is the witness's 80% accuracy). 
* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (this is 15% based on population data).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller (this requires considering both true positives and false positives).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) has two components:

1. **True Positive:** The attacker is tall, and the witness correctly identifies them (0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12)
2. **False Positive:** The attacker is short, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall (0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17)

Therefore: P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  Witness reliability can be influenced by factors not accounted for in this calculation (e.g., lighting, stress levels).
