Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height in similar conditions. This means their statement has weight, but it's not guaranteed to be correct.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. However, this information alone isn't enough, as the attacker might not be representative of the general population.

**Combining the Information**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness testimony with the population data:

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness would say "185cm or taller" *if* the attacker truly was that height. This is the witness's reliability in identifying tall people, which is 80% or 0.8. 

* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. This is the population data, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say "185cm or taller" regardless of the attacker's actual height.  This requires considering both scenarios:
    * Attacker is 185cm+ and witness is right (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)
    * Attacker is shorter, but witness is wrong (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17)
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
           = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.**
