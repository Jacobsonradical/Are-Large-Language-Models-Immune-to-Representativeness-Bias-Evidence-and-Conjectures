Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief (population height distribution) with new evidence (witness testimony) to get a more accurate probability of the attacker's height.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (0.15).
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually tall (0.80).
* **P(B| not A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually shorter than 185cm (0.20).  This is because if they are wrong 20% of the time overall, and the test group is split evenly, they must be wrong 20% of the time about both tall and short people.
* **P(not A):**  Probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm (0.85).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.4%.  While the witness's testimony does increase the likelihood that the attacker was taller, it's important to note that there's still a significant chance the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
