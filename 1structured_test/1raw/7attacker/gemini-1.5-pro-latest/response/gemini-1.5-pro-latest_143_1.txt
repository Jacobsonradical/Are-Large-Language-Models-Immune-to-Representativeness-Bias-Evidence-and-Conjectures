Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is accurate 80% of the time in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't definitive proof but provides strong evidence.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. 

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied. However, for simplicity and a reasonable approximation, let's use a more intuitive approach:

1. **Start with the base rate:**  15% of the city population is 185cm or taller. This is our initial probability.

2. **Factor in witness reliability:**  The witness is right 80% of the time. While this doesn't directly translate to the attacker being 80% likely to be tall, it significantly strengthens the initial probability.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given the witness's strong reliability (80%), it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is significantly higher than the base rate of 15%.  

A conservative estimate, considering the witness could be wrong, would be to place the probability slightly above the midpoint between 80% and 15%. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability is:**

```json
{
  "probability": 0.6 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A more precise calculation would require applying Bayes' Theorem and potentially considering other factors not provided in the scenario.
