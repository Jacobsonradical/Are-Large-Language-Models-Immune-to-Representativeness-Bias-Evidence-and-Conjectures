Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):**  the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

**Here's what we know from the information provided:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  Prior probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability the witness correctly identifies height given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. 
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** Prior probability of a person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of heights in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
