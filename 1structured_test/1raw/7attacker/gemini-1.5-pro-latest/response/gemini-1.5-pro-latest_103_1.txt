Here's how we can estimate the probability and format the answer as requested:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  The information about the city's population gives us a baseline.  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city would be 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. While they tend to identify height correctly, there's a margin of error.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our belief (the prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony). However, directly applying the theorem would be complex in this scenario.

**Approximation**

We can make a reasonable approximation by considering the following:

* The witness is slightly more reliable than a random guess (50% accuracy). 
* Their 80% accuracy suggests that they are more likely to be correct than not.

Therefore, it's plausible to say the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller is higher than the initial 15% due to the witness testimony but lower than the witness's 80% accuracy.

**Estimate**

A reasonable estimate for the probability, considering the witness's reliability and the city's population distribution, would be somewhere between 20% and 30%.

**Answer**

{
"probability": 0.25 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation. A more precise calculation would require a deeper dive into conditional probabilities and potentially more data about the witness's accuracy in various scenarios (e.g., were they more likely to mistake someone tall for someone short, or vice-versa?).
