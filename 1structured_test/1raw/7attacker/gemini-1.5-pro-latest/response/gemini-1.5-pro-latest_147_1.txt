Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means:
    * If the attacker IS 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness is right.
    * If the attacker IS NOT 185cm or taller, there's a 20% chance the witness is wrong (and incorrectly said they were). 

* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. It's prior information before considering the witness.

**2.  Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is about updating our belief based on new evidence (the witness testimony). Bayes' Theorem is the perfect tool:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185cm+  *given* the witness said so (what we want).
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say 185cm+  *if* the attacker actually was (80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm+ (15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say 185cm+ regardless of the actual height (this needs more calculation).

**3. Calculating P(B)**

P(B) is the chance the witness says "185cm+"  in any case.  We can get this by considering both scenarios (attacker is or isn't tall) and how the witness would likely respond:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm+**
   * Probability of this scenario: 0.15 (population distribution)
   * Probability witness says "yes": 0.8
   * Contribution to P(B): 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2: Attacker IS NOT 185cm+**
   * Probability of this scenario: 0.85 
   * Probability witness says "yes" (wrongly): 0.2
   * Contribution to P(B): 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

* **Total P(B):** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Final Calculation**

Now we have everything for Bayes':

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the population distribution, there's approximately a 41.38% probability the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.
