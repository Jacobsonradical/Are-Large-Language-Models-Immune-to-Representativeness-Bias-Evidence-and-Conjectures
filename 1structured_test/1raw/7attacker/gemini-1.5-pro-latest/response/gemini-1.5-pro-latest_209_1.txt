Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us the general prevalence of heights in the city. It's more likely someone is shorter than 185cm based on the population.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied to update our belief. 

However, we can simplify the reasoning without going deep into Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Prior Probability:** Before the witness statement, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller was simply the population percentage: 15%.

2. **Witness Impact:** The witness's testimony increases the probability.  Since they are right 80% of the time, our confidence should lean more towards the attacker being taller. 

3. **Uncertainty Remains:** It's crucial to remember the witness could be wrong (20% error rate). So, the probability shouldn't jump drastically from 15% to 80%. 

**Estimate**

Given the witness's reliability, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller would be significantly higher than the population average of 15%, but not as high as the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. 

A reasonable estimate could be somewhere between **50% to 65%**.  It's impossible to give a precise number without applying Bayes' Theorem and having more specific data.
