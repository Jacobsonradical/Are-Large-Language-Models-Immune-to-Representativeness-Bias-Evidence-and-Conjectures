Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (let's call this event "A") *given* that the witness said they were 185cm or taller (let's call this event "B").

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Breaking Down the Calculation**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness says "185cm or taller" given the attacker IS "185cm or taller." This is the witness's accuracy rate for this specific case, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of a person in the city being 185cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):**  The probability the witness says "185cm or taller" (regardless of the actual height). This can happen in two ways:
    1. The attacker IS tall, and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)
    2. The attacker IS NOT tall, and the witness is incorrect (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17)
    P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
         = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population height distribution, there's an estimated 41.38% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller.**
