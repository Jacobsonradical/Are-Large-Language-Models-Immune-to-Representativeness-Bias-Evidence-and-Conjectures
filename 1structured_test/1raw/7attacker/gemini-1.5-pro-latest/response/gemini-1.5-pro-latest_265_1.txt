Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Witness's accuracy: If the attacker is actually tall, the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Witness's error rate: If the attacker is not tall, the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of height in the population, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.**
