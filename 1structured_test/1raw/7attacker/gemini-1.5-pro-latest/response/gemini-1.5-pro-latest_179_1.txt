Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height in similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Distribution:** This information tells us that taller people (185cm or more) are less common in the city.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the city's height distribution to get a more accurate probability. This is a classic example of where Bayesian reasoning is helpful. However, without a prior probability to start with, we can estimate the probability using a simplified approach.

**Simplified Approach**

Since the witness is 80% accurate, and they stated the attacker was 185cm or taller, there's a higher chance they are correct. However, we also know that only 15% of the population is that tall.

To get a rough estimate, we can average the witness's accuracy and the population percentage:

(80% + 15%) / 2 = 47.5%

**Important Note:** This is a highly simplified approach. A more accurate calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem and would likely result in a probability closer to the population average of 15% due to the relatively low prior probability. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.475}
