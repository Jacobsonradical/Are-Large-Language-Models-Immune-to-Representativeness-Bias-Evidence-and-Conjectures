Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's height (based on population statistics) with the new information provided by the witness.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: Given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: Given the attacker is shorter than 185cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185cm or taller 20% of the time)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B)** (Posterior probability: The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the witness's identification)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate the denominator, P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)
2. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
3. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the population statistics, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
