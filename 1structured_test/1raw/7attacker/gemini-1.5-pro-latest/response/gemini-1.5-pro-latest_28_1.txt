Here's how we can estimate the probability and format the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to combine two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability (Information "a"):** The general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (15%).
* **Witness Reliability (Information "b"):** How much we can trust the witness's statement, given their 80% accuracy rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (for calculating conditional probabilities)**

While a precise calculation involves Bayes' Theorem, we can make a reasonable estimate:

1. **Start with the prior probability:** There's a 15% chance a random person in the city would be 185cm or taller.

2. **Adjust for witness reliability:** The witness isn't perfect.  Since they're wrong 20% of the time, we need to be a bit less certain than our initial 15%.

3. **Estimate:**  The probability is higher than 15% (since the witness gives us some positive evidence) but lower than 80% (the witness's accuracy on a controlled test might not perfectly reflect the real-world situation). A reasonable estimate is likely somewhere between 20% and 30%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.25} 

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A precise calculation using Bayes' Theorem would provide a more definitive answer.
