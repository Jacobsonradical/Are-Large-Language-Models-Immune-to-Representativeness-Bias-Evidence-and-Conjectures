Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  Let B be the event that the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller.

**2. State the given probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of a random person in the city being 185cm or taller)
*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually tall)
*  P(B| not A) = 0.20 (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually shorter)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate the denominator, P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%.
