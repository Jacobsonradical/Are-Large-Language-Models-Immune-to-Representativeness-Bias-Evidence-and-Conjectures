Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness said they were.

**From the given information, we know:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (this is the error rate).
* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population statistics, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.**
