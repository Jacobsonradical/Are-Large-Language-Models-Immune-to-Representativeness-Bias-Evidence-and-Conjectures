Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height but gives us a measure of trust in the witness's statement.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This information tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data.  This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied.  However, for a simplified approach, let's use a reasoning-based method:

1. **Base Rate:**  Start with the general population information. There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller. This is our starting point.

2. **Witness Adjustment:** The witness, who is right 80% of the time, identified the attacker as being in the taller group. This increases the likelihood that the attacker is indeed taller than 185cm. However, it's not a guaranteed 80% chance.

3. **Estimating Probability:**  Given the witness's reliability, we can estimate the probability to be higher than the base rate of 15%, but significantly lower than the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. A reasonable estimate would fall somewhere between these values.

**Final Estimate**

It's difficult to give a precise number without a more rigorous calculation using Bayes' Theorem. However, considering the information provided, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is likely to be around:

{probability: 0.45}

**Important Note:** This is an approximate estimate. A more accurate calculation would involve applying Bayes' Theorem to rigorously combine the probabilities.
