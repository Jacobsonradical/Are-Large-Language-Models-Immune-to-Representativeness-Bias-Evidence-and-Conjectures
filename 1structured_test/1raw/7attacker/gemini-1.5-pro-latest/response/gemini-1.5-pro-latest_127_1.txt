Here's how we can estimate the probability, incorporating both pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability (Information 'a'):**  We start with the knowledge that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our initial estimate.

* **Witness Reliability (Information 'b'):** The witness is right 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185cm or taller. This means they are more likely to be correct than incorrect.

* **Combining the Information:** We need to adjust our initial estimate (15%) based on the witness's reliability. Since the witness is more likely to be right, the probability should increase. 

While a precise Bayesian calculation would be ideal, we can make a reasonable estimate:

The witness's accuracy bumps our confidence up from the base rate. Given their 80% accuracy, we can estimate the probability to be closer to the higher end of the range between 15% (the base rate) and 80% (the witness's accuracy).

**Estimate:**

{probability: 0.6} 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a simplified estimate. A more accurate calculation would require applying Bayes' theorem, considering factors like the prevalence of crime in different demographics.
*  The reliability of eyewitness testimony is a complex issue in forensics, and even with an 80% accuracy rate in controlled conditions, real-world factors can influence their accuracy.
