Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement has weight, but it's not foolproof.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This gives us the base rate of people's heights in the city. Most people are shorter than 185cm.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the general population information.  Here's a way to think about it:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is actually tall.** If the attacker *is* 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness correctly identified them.

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is actually short.** If the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness mistakenly identified them as taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

We can't know for sure which scenario is true.  However, we can make an educated estimate using a concept called Bayes' Theorem. It's a bit complex to calculate directly here, but we can use logic:

* **The population has far fewer tall people (15%) than short people (85%).** 
* This means even with the witness's 80% accuracy, it's more likely they encountered a shorter person and misjudged the height.

**Conclusion**

While the witness testimony leans towards the attacker being taller, the low percentage of tall people in the population significantly counteracts that. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is likely lower than 80% but higher than the base rate of 15%. 

**Estimate:**

{probability: 0.4} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation. A more accurate calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem and potentially considering other factors (e.g., were there other potential distractions for the witness that night?).
