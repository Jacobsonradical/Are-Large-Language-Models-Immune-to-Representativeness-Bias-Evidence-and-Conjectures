Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. State prior probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's height distribution)
*  P(not A) = 0.85

**3. State likelihoods (from witness reliability):**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies tall person)
*  P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies short person as tall)

**4. Apply Bayes Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually tall given the witness said so. Bayes Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To get P(B), the probability of the witness saying "tall", we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and city demographics, is approximately 41.4%. This is significantly higher than the initial 15% based solely on the city's height distribution, but it's important to note the witness isn't perfectly reliable.
