Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):** Before considering the witness testimony, there's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is ideal for updating probabilities with new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given event B (witness said so).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) given event A (attacker actually is). This is 80% or 0.8 (witness's accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller), which is 15% or 0.15.
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller). This needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can happen in two ways:

1. Attacker is 185cm+ AND witness is right: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. Attacker is shorter AND witness is wrong: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Considering both the city's height distribution and the witness's reliability, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.
