Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define:**

* **Event A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually tall.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually shorter. 
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, we use:**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.**
