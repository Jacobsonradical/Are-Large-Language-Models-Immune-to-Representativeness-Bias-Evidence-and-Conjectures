Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This means their statement isn't foolproof but holds valuable information.
* **Population Distribution:** This gives us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. 

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the population data. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied. However, for a simpler explanation, let's use a more intuitive approach:

1. **Hypothetical Scenario:** Imagine 100 people in a lineup who match the general description of the attacker (excluding height).
2. **Population Distribution:** Based on the city's demographics, roughly 85 of them would be shorter than 185cm, and 15 would be 185cm or taller.
3. **Witness Accuracy:**  Of the 15 who are actually 185cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify around 80% (0.80 * 15 = 12) of them. 
4. **Witness Inaccuracy:** The witness would also incorrectly identify 20% of the shorter people (0.20 * 85 = 17) as being 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

* The witness would identify around 29 people (12 + 17) as being 185cm or taller.
* Out of these 29, only 12 are actually that tall.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population data, is approximately 12/29 = 0.41.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.41 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation. A more accurate calculation using Bayes' Theorem would incorporate prior probabilities and likelihoods more rigorously.
