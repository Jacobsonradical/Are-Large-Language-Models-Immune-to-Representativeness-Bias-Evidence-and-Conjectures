Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to combine two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability (Information 'a'):** The general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (15%).
* **Witness Reliability (Information 'b'):** How much we can trust the witness's statement, given their 80% accuracy rate.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this kind of problem. It gives us a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given that event B happened (witness said so).
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) given that event A is true (attacker actually is that tall). This is the witness's accuracy when the person is actually that tall (80% or 0.8).
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller), which is 0.15.
* P(B) = Overall probability of the witness saying "185cm or taller", regardless of whether the attacker actually is. 

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Attacker IS 185cm+ and witness is RIGHT:** 0.15 (prior) * 0.8 (accuracy) = 0.12
2. **Attacker IS NOT 185cm+ and witness is WRONG:** 0.85 (prior) * 0.2 (error rate) = 0.17
3. **P(B) = Sum of these scenarios = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is 185cm+| Witness said so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                               = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.38% probability the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.**
