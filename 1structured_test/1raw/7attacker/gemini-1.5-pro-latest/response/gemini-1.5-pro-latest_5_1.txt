Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being right about someone's height (relative to 185cm) under these conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (for a more formal approach):**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given that another event has occurred (witness saying they are 185cm or taller).

Let:

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: Witness says the person is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* P(B|A): Probability the witness says 185cm+ GIVEN the attacker is actually 185cm+. This is 80% (witness reliability).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm+ (from the population), which is 15%.
* P(B): Probability of the witness saying 185cm+ (regardless of the truth). This can be calculated by considering both scenarios:
    * Witness is right and the person is tall: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness is wrong and the person is short: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 

Now we can plug into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Conclusion**

Taking into account both the population information and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
