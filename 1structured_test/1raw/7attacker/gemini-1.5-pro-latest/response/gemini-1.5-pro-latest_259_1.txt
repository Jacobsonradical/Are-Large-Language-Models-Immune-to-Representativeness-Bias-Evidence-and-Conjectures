Here's how we can estimate the probability:

Let's use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability we want to find: the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller (A) given the witness's testimony (B).
* P(B|A) is the probability the witness would say "185cm or taller" if the attacker was actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy for this height group, which is 80% or 0.8.
* P(A) is the prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
* P(B) is the overall probability of the witness saying "185cm or taller".  This can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker is actually 185cm or taller, and the witness is correct (P(B|A) * P(A)).
    * The attacker is shorter than 185cm, but the witness is incorrect (P(B|~A) * P(~A)).

Let's calculate P(B):

* P(~A) is the probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
* P(B|~A) is the probability the witness would say "185cm or taller" if the attacker was actually shorter than 185cm. This is the witness's error rate for the shorter group, which is 20% or 0.2. 

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

{probability: 0.414}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, is approximately 41.4%.
