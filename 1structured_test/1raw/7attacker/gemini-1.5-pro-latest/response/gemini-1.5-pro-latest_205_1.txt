Here's how we can approach this problem, combining witness testimony with population statistics:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Distribution:**  Only 15% of people in the city are 185 cm or taller. This is important prior information.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can apply it:

Let:

*  Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is 0.80 (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is tall and identified correctly, or the attacker is short and misidentified).

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)

* P(B| not A) = 0.20 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone short as tall)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness believes the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability of this being true is only around 41.4% when we consider the base rate of tall people in the population.
