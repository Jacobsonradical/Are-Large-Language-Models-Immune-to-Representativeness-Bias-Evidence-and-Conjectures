Here's how we can estimate the probability and format the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (the percentage of people in the city taller than 185cm) with the new information from the witness. 

* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The probability that a random person in the city is 185cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** The probability the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller *given* the person is actually 185cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
* **Likelihood (P(B|¬A)):** The probability the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller *given* the person is actually *shorter* than 185cm (20% or 0.2, since they err 20% of the time). 
* **Posterior Probability (P(A|B)):**  The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness's statement. This is what we want to calculate.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Calculations**

* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
