Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (a):**  Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (b):** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (for a more formal approach)**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate updated probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185cm+ (A) *given* the witness saying so (B).
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness saying 185cm+ *given* the attacker actually is (80% or 0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm+ (15% or 0.15).
* P(B): Probability of the witness saying 185cm+ (this can be calculated considering both correct and incorrect identifications).

**Calculating P(B)**

* The witness correctly says "185cm+" in 80% of cases where the person *is* that tall (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12).
* They incorrectly say "185cm+" in 20% of cases where the person is *shorter* (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17). 
* So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion**

Considering both the city's height distribution and the witness's reliability, there's approximately a 41.38% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.
