Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Distribution (b):** This tells us the general height distribution in the city. It's more likely someone is shorter than 185cm simply because that's the dominant height group.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the population data. This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can be applied. However, for a simplified explanation, let's use a more intuitive approach:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker IS 185cm or taller**
   * There's an 80% chance the witness correctly identified them.

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker IS SHORTER than 185cm**
   * There's a 20% chance the witness incorrectly identified them as taller.

Since we don't know the attacker's actual height, we need to weigh the scenarios based on the population distribution:

* **Scenario 1 Weight:**  15% (chance the attacker was actually that tall) 
* **Scenario 2 Weight:** 85% (chance the attacker was actually shorter)

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to calculate an exact probability without using Bayes' Theorem. However, we can make a reasonable estimate:

* The witness testimony leans towards the attacker being taller (80% accuracy).
* However, the population heavily favors people shorter than 185cm (85%).

Considering this, the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller is likely less than 50%, but higher than the base 15% from the population distribution alone.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability might be somewhere between 0.25 and 0.35.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.3} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. A more precise calculation would require using Bayes' Theorem to formally incorporate the witness reliability and population distribution.
