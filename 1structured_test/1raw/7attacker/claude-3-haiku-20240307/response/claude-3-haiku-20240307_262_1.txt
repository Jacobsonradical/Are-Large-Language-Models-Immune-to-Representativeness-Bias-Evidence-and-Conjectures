To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.4137 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4137}
