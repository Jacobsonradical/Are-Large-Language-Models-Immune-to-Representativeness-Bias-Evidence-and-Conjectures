To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80% correct identification).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
