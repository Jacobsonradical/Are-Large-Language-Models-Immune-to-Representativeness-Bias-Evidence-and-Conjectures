To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller, 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the height as 185 cm or taller, 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6667}
