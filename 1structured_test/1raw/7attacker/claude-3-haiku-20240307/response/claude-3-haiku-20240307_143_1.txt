To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from the population distribution).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

{probability: 0.2857}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2857 (or approximately 28.57%).
