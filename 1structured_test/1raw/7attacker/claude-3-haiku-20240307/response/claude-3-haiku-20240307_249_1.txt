To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) and the evidence (the witness's identification).

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.
- The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population proportion of people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
