To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height and the witness's identification.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
