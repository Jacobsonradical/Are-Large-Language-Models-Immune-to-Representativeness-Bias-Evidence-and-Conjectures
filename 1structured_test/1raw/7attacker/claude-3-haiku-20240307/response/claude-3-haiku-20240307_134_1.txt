To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
