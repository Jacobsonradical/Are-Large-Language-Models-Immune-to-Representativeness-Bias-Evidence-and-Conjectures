To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the problem statement)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
