To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
         = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
