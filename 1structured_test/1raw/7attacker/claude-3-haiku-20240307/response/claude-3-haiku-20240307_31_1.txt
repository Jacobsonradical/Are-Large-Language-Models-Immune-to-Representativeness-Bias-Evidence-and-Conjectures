To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A = "The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
B = "The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller"

Using the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.469

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.469}
