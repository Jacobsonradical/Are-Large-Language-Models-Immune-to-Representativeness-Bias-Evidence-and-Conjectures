To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.32 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
