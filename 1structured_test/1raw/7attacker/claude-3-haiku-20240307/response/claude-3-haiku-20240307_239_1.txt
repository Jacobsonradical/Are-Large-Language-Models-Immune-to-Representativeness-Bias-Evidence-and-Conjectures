To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.34 (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3529}
