To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) = 0.15, the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
