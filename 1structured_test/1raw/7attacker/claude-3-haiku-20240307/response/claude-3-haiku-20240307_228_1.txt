To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A = The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B = The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.47}
