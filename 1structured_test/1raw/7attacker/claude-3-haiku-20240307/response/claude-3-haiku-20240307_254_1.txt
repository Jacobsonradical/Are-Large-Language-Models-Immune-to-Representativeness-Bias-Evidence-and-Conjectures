To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the proportion of the population shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4706}
