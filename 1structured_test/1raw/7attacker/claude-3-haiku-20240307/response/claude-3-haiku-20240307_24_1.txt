To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when shown a sample with half shorter and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height, is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the probability that the witness correctly identified the height)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
