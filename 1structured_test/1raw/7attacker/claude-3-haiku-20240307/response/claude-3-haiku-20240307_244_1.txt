To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
