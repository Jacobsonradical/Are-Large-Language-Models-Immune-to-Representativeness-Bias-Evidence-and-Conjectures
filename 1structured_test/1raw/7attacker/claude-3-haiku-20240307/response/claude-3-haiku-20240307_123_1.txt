To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the sample was half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
