To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means P(A) = 0.15.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. This means P(B|A) = 0.80.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the total probability of the witness correctly identifying the height, which includes both the cases where the person is 185 cm or taller and where the person is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.48

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.48 = 0.25

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.25}
