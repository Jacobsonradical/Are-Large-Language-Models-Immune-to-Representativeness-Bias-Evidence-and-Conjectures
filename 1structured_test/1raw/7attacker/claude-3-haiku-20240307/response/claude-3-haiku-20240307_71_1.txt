To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|not A) = 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A) = 0.15, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(not A) = 0.85, the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.78

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.78}
