To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (from the given information)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
       = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
