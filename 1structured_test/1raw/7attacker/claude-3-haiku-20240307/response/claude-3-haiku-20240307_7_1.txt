To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4444}
