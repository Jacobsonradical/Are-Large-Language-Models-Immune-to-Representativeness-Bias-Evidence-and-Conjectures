To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.16
P(B) = 0.28

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
P(A|B) = 0.429

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.429}
