To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

{probability: 0.2857}
