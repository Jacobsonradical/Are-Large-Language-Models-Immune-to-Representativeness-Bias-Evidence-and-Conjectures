To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from information a)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (from information b)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.286

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.286}
