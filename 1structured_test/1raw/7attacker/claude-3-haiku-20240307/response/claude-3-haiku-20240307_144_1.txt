To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.78

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.78}
