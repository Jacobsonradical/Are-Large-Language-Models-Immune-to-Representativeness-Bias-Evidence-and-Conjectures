To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = (P(witness identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(witness identification)

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the witness identification.
P(witness identification) = P(witness correctly identifies attacker) + P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker)
P(witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42

Step 2: Calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Step 3: Calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(witness identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Step 4: Calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification.
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857 or approximately 0.286

{probability: 0.286}
