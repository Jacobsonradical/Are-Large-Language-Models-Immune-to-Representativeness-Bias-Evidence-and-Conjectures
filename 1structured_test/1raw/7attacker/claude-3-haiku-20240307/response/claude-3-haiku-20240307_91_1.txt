To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.3429

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3429}
