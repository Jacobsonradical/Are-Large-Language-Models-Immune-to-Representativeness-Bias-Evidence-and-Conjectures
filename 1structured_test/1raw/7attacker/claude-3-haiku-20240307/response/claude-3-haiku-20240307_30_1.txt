To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
