To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B = the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 according to the information provided.
- P(A) = the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 according to the information provided.
- P(B) = the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is 0.2 according to the information provided.
  P(not A) = the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is 0.85 according to the information provided.
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

{probability: 0.2857}
