To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
