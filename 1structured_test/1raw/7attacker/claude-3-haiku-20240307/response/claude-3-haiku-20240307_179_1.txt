To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- E: The witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)

Given information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|~H) = 0.20 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.30

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(H|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.30 = 0.40

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.40}
