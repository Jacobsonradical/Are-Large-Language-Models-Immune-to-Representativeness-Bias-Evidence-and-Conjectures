To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.293

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.293}
