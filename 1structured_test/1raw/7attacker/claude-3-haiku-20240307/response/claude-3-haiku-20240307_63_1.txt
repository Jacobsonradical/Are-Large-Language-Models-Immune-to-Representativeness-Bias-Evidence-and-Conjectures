To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the given information)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
