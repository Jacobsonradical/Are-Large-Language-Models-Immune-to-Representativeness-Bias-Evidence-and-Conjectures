To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
