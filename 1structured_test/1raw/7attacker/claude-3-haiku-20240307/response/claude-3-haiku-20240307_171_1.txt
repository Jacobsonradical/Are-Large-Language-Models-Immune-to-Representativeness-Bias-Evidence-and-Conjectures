To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
