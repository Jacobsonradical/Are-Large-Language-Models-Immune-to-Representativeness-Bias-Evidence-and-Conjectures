To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the provided information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(A) = 0.15 (based on the given information)

Step 2: Calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) = 0.80 (based on the given information)

Step 3: Calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.38

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158 (or approximately 0.32)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.32}
