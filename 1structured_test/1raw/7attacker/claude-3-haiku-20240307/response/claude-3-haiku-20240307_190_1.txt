To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.36

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.36 = 0.33

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.33}
