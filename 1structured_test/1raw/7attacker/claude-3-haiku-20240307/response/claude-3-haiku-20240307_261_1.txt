To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller (P(A) = 0.15).
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller (P(B|A) = 0.8).
- The witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.35

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
