To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such (this is the value we want to estimate)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are (this is 80% or 0.8)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (this is 15%, or 0.15)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller (this is the sum of the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not (this is 20% or 0.2)
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (this is 85%, or 0.85)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.23

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52 or 52%.
