To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probability we want to find is P(A|B), which can be found using the following formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
