To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the population height distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

Let's denote:
- P(Taller) as the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to the population distribution.
- P(Shorter) as the probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85 according to the population distribution.
- P(Witness|Taller) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80 according to the witness's accuracy.
- P(Witness|Shorter) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, which is 20% or 0.20 according to the witness's accuracy.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (P(Taller|Witness)). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(Taller|Witness) = P(Witness|Taller) \* P(Taller) / (P(Witness|Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness|Shorter) \* P(Shorter))

Plugging in the values:

P(Taller|Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

P(Taller|Witness) = (0.12) / ((0.12) + (0.17))

P(Taller|Witness) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Taller|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
