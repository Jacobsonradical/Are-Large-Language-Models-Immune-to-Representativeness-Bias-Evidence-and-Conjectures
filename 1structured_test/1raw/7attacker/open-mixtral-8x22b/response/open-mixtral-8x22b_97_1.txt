To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, P(A) is the prior probability of A, and P(B) is the prior probability of B.

From the given information, we have:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time).
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) = 0.5 (half the sample used to assess the witness's ability was 185 cm or taller, and the witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time for both halves of the sample).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24, or 24%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness is equally likely to encounter people of all heights in their sample. Given that the witness is in a city where 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness is more likely to encounter shorter individuals. This may affect the witness's ability to accurately judge height.

To account for this, we can adjust the calculation as follows:

- P(B) = 0.85 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm) * 0.85 (the probability of encountering a person shorter than 185 cm) + 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller) * 0.15 (the probability of encountering a person 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) = 0.7225 + 0.12
- P(B) = 0.8425

Now we can recalculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8425
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.8425
P(A|B) = 0.1424

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account the distribution of heights in the city, is approximately 14.24%, or 0.1424.
