To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information and Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: the witness's identification of the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:

- P(A): the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 15% or 0.15
- P(B|A): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller = 80% or 0.8
- P(B|~A): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm = 20% or 0.2

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

First, let's find P(~A), the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.47 or 47%

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 47%.

{probability: 0.47}
