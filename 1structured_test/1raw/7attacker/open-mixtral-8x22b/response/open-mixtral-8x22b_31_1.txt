To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller and the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

Base rate: According to the information given, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Witness accuracy: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief (base rate) based on new evidence (witness testimony). In this case, the prior probability is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, and the likelihood is the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:

* P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (witness testimony)
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller)
* P(E) is the prior probability of the evidence (the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller)

In this case, P(H) = 0.15, P(E|H) = 0.80, and P(E) = 0.50 (since the witness is equally likely to identify someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.50 = 0.24

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24.
