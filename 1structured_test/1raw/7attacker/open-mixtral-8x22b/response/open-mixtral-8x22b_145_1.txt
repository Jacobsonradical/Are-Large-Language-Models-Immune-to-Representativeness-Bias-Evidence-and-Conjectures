To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is defined as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

Given the information, we can estimate:

P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(~A), the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
