To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (B). Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A), the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~A), the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.
- P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- P(~B|~A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm, is also 80% or 0.8 (since they are equally accurate in both cases).

First, let's find P(~B|A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:

P(~B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Next, let's find P(B|~A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, let's find P(B), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, whether they are correct or not:

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
