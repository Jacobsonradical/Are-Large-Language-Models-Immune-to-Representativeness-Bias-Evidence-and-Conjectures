To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (the probability we want to find).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, without any other information.
- P(B) is the overall probability that the witness would identify a person as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be expressed as: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where P(~A) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) and P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2).

Substituting the given and calculated values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.611

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.611.
