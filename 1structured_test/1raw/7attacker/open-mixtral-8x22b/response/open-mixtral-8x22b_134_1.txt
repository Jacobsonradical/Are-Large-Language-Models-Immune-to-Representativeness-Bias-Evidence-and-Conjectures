To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.

Let's define some events:
A: The event that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified a person as 185 cm or taller.

We know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

We know P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
