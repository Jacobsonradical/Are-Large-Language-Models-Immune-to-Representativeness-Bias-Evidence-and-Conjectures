To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A): The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
3. P(B|~A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%.

Now, we need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41379.
