To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let event A be "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the given information, we know:
- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.80.
- P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.20.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.80, and P(B|¬A) = 0.20. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3488

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3488.
