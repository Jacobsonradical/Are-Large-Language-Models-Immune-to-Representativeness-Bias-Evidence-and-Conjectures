To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85. Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
