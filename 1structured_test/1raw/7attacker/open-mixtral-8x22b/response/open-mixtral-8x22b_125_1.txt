To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability and the witness's testimony.

The prior probability is the background information about the population's height distribution: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that without any additional information, there is a 15% chance that a random person chosen from this population would be 185 cm or taller.

Next, we consider the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases under conditions similar to that night. However, we do not know whether the witness's testimony in this particular case was correct or not.

To update our probability estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's testimony (B).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, P(B|A) is the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 15% or 0.15), and P(B) is the probability of the witness's testimony overall.

We know that P(B|A) is 80%, or 0.8, because that is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, we do not have enough information to calculate P(B) directly, as we do not know the overall probability of the witness making a correct or incorrect identification.

To estimate P(B), we can use the fact that the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. However, we also need to consider the prior probability of the attacker's height. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is an 85% chance that the witness will be incorrect if they identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the overall probability of the witness making a correct identification is:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 = 0.5

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5, or 50%.

However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's testimony was equally likely to be correct or incorrect in this case, which may not be true. Additionally, this estimate does not take into account other factors that may affect the probability, such as the attacker's build or clothing, or any other evidence that may be available.
