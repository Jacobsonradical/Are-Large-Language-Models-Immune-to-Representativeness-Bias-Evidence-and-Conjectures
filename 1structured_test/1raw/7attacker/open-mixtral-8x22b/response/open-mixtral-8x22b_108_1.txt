To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the available information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We know P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.37

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.37.
