To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H ∣ E) = P(E ∣ H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(H) is the prior probability that a random person's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(E ∣ H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that their height is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(E) is the total probability that the witness identifies any person as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(E) = P(E ∣ H) * P(H) + P(E ∣ not H) * P(not H)

Where P(not H) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%), and P(E ∣ not H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that their height is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20%).

Using these values:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

P(H ∣ E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
