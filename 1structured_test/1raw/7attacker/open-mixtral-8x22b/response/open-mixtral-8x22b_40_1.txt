To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, our prior belief is that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is based on the population data.

The new evidence is the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as such, and a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as being shorter than 185 cm. Similarly, if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are), and P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.38

So, given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.38.
