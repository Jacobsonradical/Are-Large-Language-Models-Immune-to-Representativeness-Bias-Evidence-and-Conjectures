To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief (the population distribution) with the likelihood of the witness's testimony.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying people 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying people shorter than 185 cm)

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know that P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), so:
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.26

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615 (or 46.15%).
