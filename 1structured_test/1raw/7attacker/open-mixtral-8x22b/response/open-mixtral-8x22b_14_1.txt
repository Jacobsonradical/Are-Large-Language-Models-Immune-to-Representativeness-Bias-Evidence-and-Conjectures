To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this context:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller given that they were indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller, which includes the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is incorrect.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the witness was correct and where the witness was incorrect. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is:

0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4

Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is:

0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Therefore, P(B) is the sum of these probabilities:

P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24 / 0.5 = 0.48

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48.
