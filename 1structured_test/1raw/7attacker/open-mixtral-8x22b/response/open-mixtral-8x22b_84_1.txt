To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability estimate with new evidence.

In this case, our prior probability (P(H)) is the general population's height distribution:
P(H) = P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

The new evidence (E) is the witness's testimony, with two possible outcomes: correct (C) or incorrect (I).

P(E|H) is the probability of the witness's testimony given the attacker's height. Based on the information, the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time:
P(E|H) = P(C|H) = 80% = 0.8
P(E|~H) = P(I|~H) = 20% = 0.2

However, we also need to consider the witness's testimony given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm (~H). Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, we can say that:
P(E|~H) = P(I|~H) = 20% = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E)):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we have:
P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)]
P(H|E) = [0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
