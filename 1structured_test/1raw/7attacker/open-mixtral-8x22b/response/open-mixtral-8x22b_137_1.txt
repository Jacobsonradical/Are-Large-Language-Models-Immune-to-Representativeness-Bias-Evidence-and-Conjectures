To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification,
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller,
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, and
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, and
- P(~A) is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
