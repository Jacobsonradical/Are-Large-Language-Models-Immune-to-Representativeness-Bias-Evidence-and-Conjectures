To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information about the general population height distribution with the witness's ability to accurately assess height under similar conditions.

From the population data, we know that the prior probability (P(H)) of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%. This is our baseline probability.

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. To incorporate this information, we need to consider the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

We can calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E)) that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness evidence (E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Here, P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80% or 0.8). P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15). P(E) is the overall probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Here, P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 20% or 0.2, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time). P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Now, let's calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.255

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.47 or 47%.
