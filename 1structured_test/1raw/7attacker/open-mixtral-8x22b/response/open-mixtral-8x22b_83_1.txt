To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the population's height distribution.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify this 80% of the time. However, there's also a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the population's height distribution. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that a randomly chosen person in the city would have a 15% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
