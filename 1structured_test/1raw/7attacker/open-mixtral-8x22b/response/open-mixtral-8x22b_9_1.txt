To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information: the general population height distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

The base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population is 15%. However, we have additional information from the witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The witness's accuracy is 80% when identifying a person's height, and they make errors 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's assume the witness's error rate is consistent regardless of whether the person is shorter or taller than 185 cm. In that case, when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're correct and a 20% chance they're wrong.

However, since only 15% of the population is actually 185 cm or taller, even if the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is lower than the base rate of 15%. This is because the witness's identification of the attacker as 185 cm or taller is influenced by their error rate.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185cm | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185cm)] / [P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185cm) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185cm) * P(Attacker < 185cm)]

Given:
- P(Attacker ≥ 185cm) = 0.15
- P(Attacker < 185cm) = 0.85
- P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185cm) = 0.80
- P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185cm) = 0.20 (since the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(Attacker ≥ 185cm | Witness Identification) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] = 0.3415 or 34.15%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3415.
