To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful for calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H) given that the witness identified the attacker as such (W).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W)

P(H|W) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

P(W|H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that height. According to the provided information, this probability is 80%, or 0.8.

P(H) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the provided information, this probability is 15%, or 0.15.

P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated by considering both the true positives (when the witness is correct) and the false positives (when the witness is mistaken).

P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H)

P(not H) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm. According to the provided information, this probability is 85%, or 0.85.

P(W|not H) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time, this probability is 20%, or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
