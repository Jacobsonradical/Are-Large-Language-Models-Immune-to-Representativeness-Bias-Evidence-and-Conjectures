To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, based on the population statistics (Event b).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% (Event a).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 20% (the error rate, Event a).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (~A) is 85%. Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4118

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4118.
