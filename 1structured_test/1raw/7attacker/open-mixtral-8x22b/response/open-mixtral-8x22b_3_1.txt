To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given the following information:

- Prior probability of A (pr(A)): 0.15 (from the population data)
- Probability of B given A (pr(B | A)): 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- Probability of B given not A (pr(B | not A)): 0.2 (from the witness's error rate)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of A given B (pr(A | B)) as follows:

pr(A | B) = (pr(B | A) * pr(A)) / (pr(B | A) * pr(A) + pr(B | not A) * pr(not A))

Substituting the given values, we get:

pr(A | B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.3429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3429.
