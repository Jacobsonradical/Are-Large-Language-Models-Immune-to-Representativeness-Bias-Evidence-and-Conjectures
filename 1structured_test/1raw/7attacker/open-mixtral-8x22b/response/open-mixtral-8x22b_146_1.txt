To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is calculated by updating our prior beliefs with the observed evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller, and the observed evidence is the witness's ability to judge height accurately.

Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

From the given information, we have:

1. The prior probability P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) = 0.80 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
3. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, P(B|~A) = 0.20 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know P(~A), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). Let's plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.80 * 0.15)] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
