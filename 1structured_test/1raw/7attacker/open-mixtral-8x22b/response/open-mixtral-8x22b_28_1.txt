To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Given:
- Prior probability that a random individual is 185 cm or taller (P(H)): 15% or 0.15
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (P(E|H)): 80% or 0.8
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (P(E|not H)): 20% or 0.2

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such (P(H|E)).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the numerator:
0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Calculating the denominator:
(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the posterior probability:
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
