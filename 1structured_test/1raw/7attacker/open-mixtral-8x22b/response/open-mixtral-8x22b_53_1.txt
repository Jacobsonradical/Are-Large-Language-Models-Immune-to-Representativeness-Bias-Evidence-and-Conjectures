To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually that tall.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as the sum of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is incorrect.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is incorrect and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).
- P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 = 0.5217

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5217 or 52.17%.
