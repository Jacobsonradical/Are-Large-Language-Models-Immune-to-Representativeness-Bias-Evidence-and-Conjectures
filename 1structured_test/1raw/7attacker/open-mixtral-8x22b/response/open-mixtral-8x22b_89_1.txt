To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

First, we'll list the probabilities we know:
1. P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, is 15% (or 0.15).
2. P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker truly is 185 cm or taller, is 80% (or 0.8).
3. P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter, is 20% (or 0.2).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Where P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (or 0.85).

Now, plug in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.514

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.514.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.514}
