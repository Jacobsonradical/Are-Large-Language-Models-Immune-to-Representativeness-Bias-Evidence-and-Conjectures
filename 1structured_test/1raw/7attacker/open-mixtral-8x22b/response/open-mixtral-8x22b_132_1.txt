To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this will be our prior probability, P(H), where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Now, considering the witness testimony, we have:

P(E|H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8.

P(E|~H): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Here, the witness incorrectly identifies the height in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(H|E), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the witness testimony and the prior probabilities, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
