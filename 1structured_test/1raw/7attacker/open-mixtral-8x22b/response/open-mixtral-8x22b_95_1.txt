To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the prior probability, which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller without any additional information. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, our prior probability is:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, we need the likelihood, which is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, the witness is correct 80% of the time:

P(E|H) = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time and half the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of the witness making this mistake:

P(E|¬H) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

We know that P(¬H) = 1 - P(H), which is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬H) = 0.85

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) ≈ 0.65

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.65.
