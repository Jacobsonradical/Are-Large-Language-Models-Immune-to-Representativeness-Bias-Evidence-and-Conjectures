To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's ability to accurately identify height.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W.

We know that P(A) = 0.15, which is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller.

From the information about the witness, we can calculate the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|A). This is the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying taller individuals, which is 0.80.

We can also calculate the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(W|¬A). This is the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying shorter individuals, which is 0.80 as well. However, since the witness made an error in 20% of the cases, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, denoted as P(A|W).

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We know P(W|A) = 0.80, P(A) = 0.15, and since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, P(W|¬A) = 0.20.

Substituting these values into the formula:

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(A|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|W) ≈ 0.4138

So, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
