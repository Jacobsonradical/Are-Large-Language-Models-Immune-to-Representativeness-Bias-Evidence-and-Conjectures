To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (The witness makes an error 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A)\*P(A) + P(B|¬A)\*P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.31

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.31 ≈ 0.387

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.387.
