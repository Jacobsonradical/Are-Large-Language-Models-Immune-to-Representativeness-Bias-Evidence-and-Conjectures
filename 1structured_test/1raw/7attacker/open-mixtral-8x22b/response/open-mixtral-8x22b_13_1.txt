To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness report) = [P(Witness report | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm)] / P(Witness report)

We know that:
- P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15 (from information a)
- P(Witness report | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 80% = 0.8 (from information b)

We still need to find P(Witness report) to complete the calculation. We know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. However, since the witness can make mistakes, we need to consider the false positive rate (FPR) as well.

The FPR is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time. However, we need to split this 20% into false positives (mistakenly identifying a shorter person as tall) and false negatives (mistakenly identifying a tall person as short). Given the information provided, we don't know the exact false positive rate, but we can make an assumption to proceed.

Assuming that the witness makes mistakes equally likely in both directions (false positives and false negatives), then the false positive rate would be half of the total error rate:

FPR = 0.5 * 20% = 10% = 0.1

Now, we can calculate P(Witness report) as the weighted sum of the probability of the witness being correct and the false positive rate:

P(Witness report) = P(Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Witness report | Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Height < 185 cm) * FPR

P(Witness report) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1

P(Witness report) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness report) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.205 ≈ 0.585

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.585 or 58.5%.
