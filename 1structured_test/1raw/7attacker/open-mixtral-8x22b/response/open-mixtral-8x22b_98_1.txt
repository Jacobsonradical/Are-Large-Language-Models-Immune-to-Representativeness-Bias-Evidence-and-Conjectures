To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identified someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness has a 20% error rate, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
