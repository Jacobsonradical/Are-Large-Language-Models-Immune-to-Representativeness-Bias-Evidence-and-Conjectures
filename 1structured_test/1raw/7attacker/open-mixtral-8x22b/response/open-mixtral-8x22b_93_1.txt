To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

First, let's define our hypotheses and evidence:

Hypotheses (H):
1. H₁: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
2. H₂: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Evidence (E): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(H₁) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(H₂) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E | H₁) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identified the person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they were actually shorter)
- P(E | H₂) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identified the person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they were actually 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(H₂ | E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H₂ | E) = [P(E | H₂) \* P(H₂)] / [P(E | H₁) \* P(H₁) + P(E | H₂) \* P(H₂)]

Now we can plug in the values:

P(H₂ | E) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.20 \* 0.85 + 0.80 \* 0.15] = 0.6363636363636364

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.636 (63.6%).
