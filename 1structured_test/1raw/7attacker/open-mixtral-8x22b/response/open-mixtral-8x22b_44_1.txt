To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood.

1. Prior probability (P(H)): This is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, without any additional information. According to the given information, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

2. Likelihood (P(E|H)): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. Marginal likelihood (P(E)): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|¬H)P(¬H), where P(¬H) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85), and P(E|¬H) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller (0.2). Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29.

4. Posterior probability (P(H|E)): This is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H) / P(E). Substituting the values calculated above, we get P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
