To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or assumptions.

Let's break down the information given:

- P(H ≥ 185 cm): the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.
- P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm | H < 185 cm): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 20% or 0.2.

Now, we want to find P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness says H ≥ 185 cm), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness says H ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm) * P(H ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm)

To find P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm), we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm) * P(H ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm | H < 185 cm) * P(H < 185 cm)

Given that P(H < 185 cm) = 85% or 0.85, we can calculate:

P(Witness says H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness says H ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
