To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is given by the population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness identification (correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time).

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A and the witness's identification as a correct height judgment as B. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the complement of P(A))
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

Now, plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.4138.
