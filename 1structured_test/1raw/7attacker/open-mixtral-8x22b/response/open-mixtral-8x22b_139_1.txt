To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is given by the population statistics (b), and the new evidence comes from the witness statement (a).

First, let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the population statistics, the prior probability P(A) is:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

The witness statement provides us with the following probabilities:
- P(W|A): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, as the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
- P(W|A^C): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2, as the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A^C) \* P(A^C))

We know that P(A^C) is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), so we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(A|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.3636

Therefore, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3636.
