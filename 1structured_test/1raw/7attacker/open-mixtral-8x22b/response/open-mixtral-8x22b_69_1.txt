To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substitute the values from above:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculate the values:

P(A|B) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
