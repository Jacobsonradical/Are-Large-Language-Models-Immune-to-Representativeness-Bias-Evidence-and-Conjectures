To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or beliefs. In this case, we have the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (20% or 0.2).

Let's denote:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (our goal is to find P(A)).
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such (the posterior probability).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8, the witness's accuracy for tall people).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2, the witness's error rate for short people).
- P(~A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85 or 85%).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substitute the given values:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Carry out the calculation:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.

Answer: {probability: 0.46}
