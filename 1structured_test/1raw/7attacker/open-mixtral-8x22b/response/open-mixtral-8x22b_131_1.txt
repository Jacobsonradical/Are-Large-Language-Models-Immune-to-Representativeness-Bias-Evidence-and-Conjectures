To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, we have the following:

1. Prior probability (P(H)): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. Likelihood (P(E|H)): The probability that the witness would identify the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
3. Likelihood (P(E|~H)): The probability that the witness would identify the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is the remaining 20% of the cases, or 0.20.
4. Posterior probability (P(H|E)): The probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(H|E) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

{probability: 0.41}
