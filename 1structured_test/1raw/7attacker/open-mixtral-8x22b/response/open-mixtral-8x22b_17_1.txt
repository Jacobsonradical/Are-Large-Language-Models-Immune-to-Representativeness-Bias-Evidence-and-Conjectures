To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge height and the general height distribution of the population. This is a conditional probability problem, and we can use Bayes' theorem to find our estimate.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We know that P(¬A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm), since it's the complement of P(A).

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|W) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
