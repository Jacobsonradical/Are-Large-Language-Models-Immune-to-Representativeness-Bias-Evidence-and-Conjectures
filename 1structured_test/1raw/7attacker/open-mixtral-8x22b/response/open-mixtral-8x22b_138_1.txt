To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- H as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We have the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when someone is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when someone is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

Substitute the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
