To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the likelihood of B given A times the prior probability of A, normalized by the prior probability of B.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): Prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(B|A): Likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(B|~A): Likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time in this case)
- P(~A): Prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
