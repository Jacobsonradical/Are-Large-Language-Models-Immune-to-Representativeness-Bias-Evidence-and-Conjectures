To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful in this case as we have prior knowledge about the population's height distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify height under similar conditions.

Let's denote:
A = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B = The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we must consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Here, ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(~A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
