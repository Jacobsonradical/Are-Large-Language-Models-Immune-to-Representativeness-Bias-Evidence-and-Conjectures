To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's define our events:
A = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Our prior probability (P(A)) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

The likelihood (P(B|A)) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that they indeed are. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

The likelihood (P(B|~A)) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are not. This is given as 20% or 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of cases).

The probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller (P(~A)) is the complement of P(A), which is 85% or 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
