To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we consider both instances where the witness is correct and where the witness is incorrect.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 0.85 (probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
