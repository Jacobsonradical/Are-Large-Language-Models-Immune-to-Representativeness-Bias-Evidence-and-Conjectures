To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W.

First, we know that the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the population is 15% or 0.15. This is our prior probability P(A).

Next, we have the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time (P(W|A) = 0.8) and errs 20% of the time (P(W|~A) = 0.2).

We want to find the posterior probability P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.22

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.5454545

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.
