To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.80 (80%).
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (20%).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Since P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
