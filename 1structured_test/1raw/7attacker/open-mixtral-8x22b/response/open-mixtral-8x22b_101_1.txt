To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided and apply Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have information about the witness's errors (whether they tend to overestimate or underestimate height), we'll make a simplifying assumption that errors are equally likely in either direction.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

Since we don't have data on the witness's errors, we'll assume they are equally likely to overestimate or underestimate height. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller (P(B|not A)) would be half of the total error rate, which is 0.1 (20% error rate / 2).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and we already calculated P(B|not A) = 0.1.

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.215

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.215 â‰ˆ 0.558

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.558.
