To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability based on the population data and the likelihood of the witness being correct.

First, let's consider the prior probability, which is the probability of encountering someone who is 185 cm or taller in the city based on the population data. According to the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error was in identifying a shorter person as taller or vice versa. Since we don't have this information, we'll assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be in either direction.

Given this, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is correct) * P(Witness is correct) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is incorrect) * P(Witness is incorrect)

We know that P(Witness is correct) = 0.8 and P(Witness is incorrect) = 0.2.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is correct) is the same as the prior probability, which is 0.15.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is incorrect) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's errors are equally likely to be in either direction, this probability is 0.5 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.425.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.425 * 0.2

= 0.12 + 0.085

= 0.205

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.205, or 20.5%.
