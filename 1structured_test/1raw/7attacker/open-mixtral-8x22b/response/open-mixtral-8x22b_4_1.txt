To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the likelihood of B given A times the prior probability of A, divided by the prior probability of B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given the following probabilities:

- Prior probability of A (P(A)): 15% or 0.15 (from the population distribution)
- Probability of B given A (P(B|A)): 80% or 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- Probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)): 20% or 0.2 (from the witness's error rate)
- Prior probability of not A (P(not A)): 85% or 0.85 (from the population distribution)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of A given B (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
