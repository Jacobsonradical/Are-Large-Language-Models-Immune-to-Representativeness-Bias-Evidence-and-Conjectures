To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

The prior probability (P(H)) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.

The likelihood (P(E|H)) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, this is 0.8.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (P(E|~H)), is 0.2, since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases.

The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (P(~H)) is 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.5333

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5333.
