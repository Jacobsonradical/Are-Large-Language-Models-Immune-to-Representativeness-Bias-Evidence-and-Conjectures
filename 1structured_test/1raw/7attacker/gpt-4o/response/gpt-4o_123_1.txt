To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is how we proceed:

Let's define the following events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed that height).
4. \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter).

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ {probability: 0.41} \]
