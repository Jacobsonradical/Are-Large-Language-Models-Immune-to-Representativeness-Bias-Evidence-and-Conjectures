To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the general population data, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \lnot T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Convert Given Information:**
   - Prior probability \( P(T) \): 15% or 0.15
   - Prior probability \( P(\lnot T) \): 85% or 0.85
   - Sensitivity \( P(W | T) \): Prob witness correctly identifies height if the person is 185 cm or taller: 80% or 0.8
   - Specificity \( P(W | \lnot T) \): Probability witness erroneously identifies the person as 185 cm or taller if the person is shorter: 20% or 0.2

3. **Bayes' Theorem Formula:**
   \[
   P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \lnot T) \cdot P(\lnot T)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(T | W) \):**
   \[
   P(T | W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
