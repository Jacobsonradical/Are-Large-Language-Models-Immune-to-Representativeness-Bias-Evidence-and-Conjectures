To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(\text{Tall}) \): Prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "a").
- \( P(\text{Not Tall}) \): Prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information "a").
- \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{Tall}) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from information "b").
- \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{Tall}) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a tall person = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (from information "b").
- \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{Not Tall}) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm = 0.80.
- \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{Not Tall}) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

We want to find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as tall.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Not Tall}) \]

Let's fill in the numbers:

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{Not Tall}) = 0.85 \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
