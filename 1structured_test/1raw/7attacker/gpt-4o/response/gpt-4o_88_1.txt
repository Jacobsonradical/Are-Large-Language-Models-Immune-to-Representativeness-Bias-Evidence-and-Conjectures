To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the relevant events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. 

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(T) \), \( P(W | T) \), and \( P(W) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(T) \):**

This is the initial probability that any random person in the city is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(T) = 0.15 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(W | T) \):**

This is the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W | T) = 0.80 \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(W) \):**

This is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, considering both cases (taller and shorter):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | T') \cdot P(T') \]
Where:
- \( T' \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(T') = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T') \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%:
\[ P(W | T') = 0.20 \]

Thus, we have:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]

Please enter the number between 0 and 1:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
