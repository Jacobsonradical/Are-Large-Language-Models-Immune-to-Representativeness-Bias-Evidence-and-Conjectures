To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the information given, we have:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.)
- \( P(W|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
