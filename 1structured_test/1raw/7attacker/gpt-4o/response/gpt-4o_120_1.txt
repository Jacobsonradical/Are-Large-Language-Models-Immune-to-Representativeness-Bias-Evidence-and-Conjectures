To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \)

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A')} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{12}{29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
