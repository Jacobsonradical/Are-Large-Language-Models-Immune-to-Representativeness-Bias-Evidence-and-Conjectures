To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's identify the probabilities provided:
- \( P(T) \): Probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller. Given as 0.15.
- \( P(T^c) \): Probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. \( P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \).

From the witness identification information:
- \( P(W|T) \): The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller. Given as 0.80.
- \( P(W|T^c) \): The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given as 0.20.

To complete Bayes' theorem, we also need \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Now calculating step-by-step:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138. 

Hence, the answer in the required format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
