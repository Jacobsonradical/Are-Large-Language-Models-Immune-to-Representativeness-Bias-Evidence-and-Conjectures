To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \bar{H} \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\bar{H}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E|\bar{H}) = 0.20 \)

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\bar{H}) \cdot P(\bar{H})
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(\approx 0.414\).

The answer is:

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
