To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \) (Probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{Not Tall}) = 0.85 \) (Probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \) (Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone tall as tall)
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) = 0.20 \) (Probability of the witness mistakenly identifying someone not tall as tall)

We want to find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \):

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \times P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \times P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) \times P(\text{Not Tall}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \):
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
