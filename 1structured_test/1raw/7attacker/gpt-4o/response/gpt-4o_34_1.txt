To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a person in the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|H^c) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

First, we calculate the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|H^c)P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
