We need to use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Given the information, we can define:

- \( P(\text{T} \mid \text{I}) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(\text{I} \mid \text{T}) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{I} \mid \neg\text{T}) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{T}) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that someone in the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg\text{T}) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that someone in the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(\text{T} \mid \text{I}) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{T} \mid \text{I}) = \frac{P(\text{I} \mid \text{T}) \cdot P(\text{T})}{P(\text{I})}
\]

To find \( P(\text{I}) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{I}) = P(\text{I} \mid \text{T}) \cdot P(\text{T}) + P(\text{I} \mid \neg\text{T}) \cdot P(\neg\text{T})
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(\text{I}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can use this to calculate:

\[
P(\text{T} \mid \text{I}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \}
\]
