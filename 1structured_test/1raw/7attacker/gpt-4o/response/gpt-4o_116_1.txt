To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. Hereâ€™s the information we have:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(T) \))**:
   - \( P(T) \) is the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
   - Given: \( P(T) = 0.15 \).

2. **Prior Probability of being shorter than 185 cm (\( P(\neg T) \))**:
   - \( P(\neg T) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \).

3. **Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller (\( P(E|T) \))**:
   - Given: \( P(E|T) = 0.80 \).

4. **Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (\( P(E|\neg T) \))**:
   - Given: \( P(E|\neg T) = 0.20 \).

First, we calculate the total probability of the evidence (\( P(E) \)) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|T) \cdot P(T) + P(E|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence (witness's identification):

\[ P(T|E) = \frac{P(E|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(T|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
