To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probabilities we know are:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (The probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(W) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
