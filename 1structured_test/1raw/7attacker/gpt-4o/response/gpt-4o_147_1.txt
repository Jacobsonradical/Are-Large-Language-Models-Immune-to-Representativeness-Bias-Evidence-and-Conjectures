To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(W) \) which is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
