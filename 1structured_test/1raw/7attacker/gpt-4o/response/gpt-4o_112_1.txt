To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The following information is given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being tall)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we use this to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
