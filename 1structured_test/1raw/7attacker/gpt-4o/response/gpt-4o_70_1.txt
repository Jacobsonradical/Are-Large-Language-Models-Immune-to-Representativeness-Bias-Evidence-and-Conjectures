To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|A^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

To compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
