To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( H \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_H \): Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_L \): Event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H | W_H) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H | W_H) = \frac{P(W_H | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_H)} \]

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller \( = 0.15 \).
- \( P(L) \): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm \( = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W_H | H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller \( = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W_H | L) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm \( = 0.20 \).

We need to calculate \( P(W_H) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_H) = P(W_H | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_H | L) \cdot P(L) \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P(W_H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_H) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_H) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_H) = \frac{P(W_H | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_H)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_H) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_H) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
