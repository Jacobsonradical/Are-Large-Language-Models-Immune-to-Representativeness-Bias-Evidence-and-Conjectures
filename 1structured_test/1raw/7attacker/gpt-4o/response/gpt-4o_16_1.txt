This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We know the following from the information provided:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller = 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller = 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness misidentifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 20% or 0.20.

Next, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
