To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(H) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \): Witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \): Witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{(0.80) \cdot (0.15) + (0.20) \cdot (0.85)} \]

Calculating the numerator and the denominator:
- Numerator: \( 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \)
- Denominator: \( (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.41.
