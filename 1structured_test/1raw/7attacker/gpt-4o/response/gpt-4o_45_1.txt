To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) : The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now, we can calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
