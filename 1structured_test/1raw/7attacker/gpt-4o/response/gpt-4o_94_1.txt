To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

- The probability that someone is 185 cm or taller based solely on city data \(P(T) = 0.15\).
- The probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm based solely on city data \(P(S) = 0.85\).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person of 185 cm or taller, \(P(I | T) = 0.80\).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, \(P(I | S) = 0.20\).

We need to find the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such, \(P(T | I)\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T | I) = \frac{P(I | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(I)} \]

Where \(P(I)\) is the total probability of the identification event:
\[ P(I) = P(I | T) \cdot P(T) + P(I | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Let's calculate \(P(I)\):
\[ P(I) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(I) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(I) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | I) = \frac{P(I | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(I)} \]
\[ P(T | I) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | I) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | I) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(\approx 0.414\).

So, the answer in the required format is:
