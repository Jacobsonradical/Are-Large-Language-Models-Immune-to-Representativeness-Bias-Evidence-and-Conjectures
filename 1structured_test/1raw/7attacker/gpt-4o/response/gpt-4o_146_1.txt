To determine the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification, we can use Bayes’ Theorem. Here, we'll denote:

- \( P(H \geq 185 | W) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W | H \geq 185) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- \( P(W | H < 185) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
- \( P(H \geq 185) \): The prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(H < 185) \): The prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W) = \frac{P(W | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W | H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
