To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness has identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To apply this formula, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(W \mid T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.
3. \( P(W) \): The total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Given:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid S) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

First, we calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) P(T) + P(W \mid S) P(S) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138. In the requested format:
