To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we will use Bayes’ Theorem.

Given:
- \( P(\text{Witness says tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person)
- \( P(\text{Witness says tall} | \text{Not tall}) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a not tall person as tall, based on 20% error rate)
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that a person is tall, 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{Not tall}) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that a person is not tall, shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says tall}) \), which is the posterior probability that the attacker is tall given that the witness identified them as tall.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Witness says tall})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Witness says tall}) = P(\text{Witness says tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Witness says tall} | \text{Not tall}) \cdot P(\text{Not tall}) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(\text{Witness says tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says tall}) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
