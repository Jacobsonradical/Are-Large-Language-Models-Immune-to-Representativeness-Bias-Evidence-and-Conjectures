To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant probabilities and the steps to derive the solution:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(T \geq 185) \))**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller.
   \[ P(T \geq 185) = 0.15 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability (\( P(T < 185) \))**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 185 cm.
   \[ P(T < 185) = 0.85 \]

3. **Likelihood (\( P(W|T \geq 185) \))**:
   The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
   \[ P(W|T \geq 185) = 0.8 \]

4. **Complementary Likelihood (\( P(W|T < 185) \))**:
   The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   \[ P(W|T < 185) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(T \geq 185|W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T \geq 185|W) = \frac{P(W|T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(W|T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
