To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness makes an identification.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W \mid S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
