To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

We need to compute \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, compute \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
