To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Specifically, we need to find \( P(T \ge 185 \mid W) \), where \( T \) is the attacker's height and \( W \) is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's define the terms:
- \( P(T \ge 185) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T < 185) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W \mid T \ge 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W \mid T < 185) = 0.20 \)

We will apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185) + P(W \mid T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(T \ge 185 \mid W) \):
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W) = 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
