We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | H^c) = 0.20 \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
