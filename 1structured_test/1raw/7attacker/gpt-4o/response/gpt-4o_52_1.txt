Given the use of Bayes' Theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we need to use the following probabilities given in the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
- \( P(N) = 0.85 \) (probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the city)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness identifies a 185 cm or taller person correctly)
- \( P(W|N) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness misidentifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|N) \cdot P(N) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
