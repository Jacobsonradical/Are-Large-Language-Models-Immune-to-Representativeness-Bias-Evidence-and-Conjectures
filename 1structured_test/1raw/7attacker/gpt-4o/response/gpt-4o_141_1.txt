To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are.
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(H | W) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \): the total probability that the witness would identify a person as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the provided values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | W) \):
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.4138}
