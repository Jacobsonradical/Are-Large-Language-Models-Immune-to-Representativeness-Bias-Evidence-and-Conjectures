We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, we'll use the information provided:

- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height if the person is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height if the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.41} \]
