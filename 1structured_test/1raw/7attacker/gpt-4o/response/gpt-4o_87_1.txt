To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the known information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the information provided:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
