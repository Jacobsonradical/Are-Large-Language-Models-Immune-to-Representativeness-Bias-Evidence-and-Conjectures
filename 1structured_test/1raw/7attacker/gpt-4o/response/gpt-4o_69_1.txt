We can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H' \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

- The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is 0.15.
- The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(H') \), is 0.85.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, \( P(E | H) \), is 0.8.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, \( P(E | H') \), is 0.2.

Now, we want the posterior probability \( P(H | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the event \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | H') \cdot P(H') \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:

{probability: 0.41}
