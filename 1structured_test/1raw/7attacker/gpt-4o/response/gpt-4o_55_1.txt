To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) \) = Probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
   - \( P(T^c) \) = Probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

3. **Witness reliability:**
   - \( P(W | T) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 0.8
   - \( P(W | T^c) \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter = 0.2

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

4. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | T^c) \cdot P(T^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(T | W) \):**
   \[
   P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
