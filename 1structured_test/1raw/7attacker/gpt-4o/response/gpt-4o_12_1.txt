To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We're looking for \( P(H | W) \), which is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | H) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying someone 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have the following information:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.41 \} \]
