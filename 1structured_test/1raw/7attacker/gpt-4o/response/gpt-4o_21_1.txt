To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s how we break it down:

1. **Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
2. **Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.**

We are given:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The complement \( P(H^c) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- The accuracy of the witness, \( P(W|H) \) = 0.80.
- The probability of the witness making an error, \( P(W|H^c) \) = 0.20 (since if the person is shorter than 185 cm, the witness would mistakenly identify them as 185 cm or taller in 20% of these cases).

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We can find \( P(W) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.41} \} \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
