To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Denote:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. 

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \) (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T \mid W) \):
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\{probability: 0.414\}
