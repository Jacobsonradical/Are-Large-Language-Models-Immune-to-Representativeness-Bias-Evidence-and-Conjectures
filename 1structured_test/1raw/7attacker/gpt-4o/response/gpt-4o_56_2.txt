This is a classic application of Bayes' Theorem, which in this case helps us update our probability estimate based on the evidence provided by the witness.

Given:
- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (prior probability)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \) (prior probability)
- \( P(E | H \geq 185) = 0.80 \) (probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | H < 185) = 0.20 \) (probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(H \geq 185 | E) \), where \( E \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E) = \frac{P(E | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is given by:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(E | H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H \geq 185 | E) \):
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
