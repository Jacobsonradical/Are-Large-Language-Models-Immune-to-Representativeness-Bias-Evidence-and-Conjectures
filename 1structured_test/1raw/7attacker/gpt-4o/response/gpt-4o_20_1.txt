To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Given:
- The witness's accuracy in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller: 80%.
- The witness's error rate in identifying someone incorrectly: 20%.
- The base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the population: 15% (or 0.15).
- The base rate of people shorter than 185 cm in the population: 85% (or 0.85).

Let's define our events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W \mid T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

We know that:
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller, which is 0.20.
- \( P(\neg T) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

So,
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
