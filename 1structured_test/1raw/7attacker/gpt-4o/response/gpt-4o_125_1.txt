To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

From Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down these probabilities based on the information given:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
4. \( P(W|T') = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Next, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|T')P(T') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
