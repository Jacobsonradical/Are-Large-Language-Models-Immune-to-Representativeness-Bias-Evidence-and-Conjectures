To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we have:

- Prior probability \(P(H)\) that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller: 0.15 (15%).
- Prior probability \(P(\neg H)\) that a person is shorter than 185 cm: 0.85 (85%).
- Probability \(P(E|H)\) that a witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are: 0.80 (80%).
- Probability \(P(E|\neg H)\) that a witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not: 0.20 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \(P(H|E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \(P(E)\), the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
