To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to determine \( P(T \mid W) \), which is given by:

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \)

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T \mid W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
