To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \(H\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \(P(H|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(W|H)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \(P(W|H) = 0.8\) (80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W|\neg H) = 0.2\) (20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To find \(P(W)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(H|W)\):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \(0.4138\).
