To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( H_t \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_t \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(W_t | H_t) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_t | H_s) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter.
- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \): The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \): The probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_t | W_t) = \frac{P(W_t | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W_t)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W_t) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_t) = P(W_t | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W_t | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]
\[ P(W_t) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_t) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_t) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_t | W_t) \):
\[ P(H_t | W_t) = \frac{P(W_t | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W_t)} \]
\[ P(H_t | W_t) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W_t) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W_t) = 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
