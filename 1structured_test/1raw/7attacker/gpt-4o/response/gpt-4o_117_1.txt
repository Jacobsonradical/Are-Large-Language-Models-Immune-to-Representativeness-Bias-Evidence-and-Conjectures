To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we'll do it step-by-step:

1. Define the events:
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. From the given information:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

3. Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

4. Calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) 
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

5. Now calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
