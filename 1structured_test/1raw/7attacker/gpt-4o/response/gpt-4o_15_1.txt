To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(H_1\) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \)

We need to find \(P(H_1 | E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
