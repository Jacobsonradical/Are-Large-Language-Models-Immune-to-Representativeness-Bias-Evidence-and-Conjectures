To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the components we need:

- Prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller (P(Tall)): 15% or 0.15
- Prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm (P(Short)): 85% or 0.85
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given that they are tall (P(Identify as tall | Tall)): 80% or 0.80
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given that they are short (P(Identify as tall | Short)): 20% or 0.20

Bayes' theorem formula for the posterior probability \(P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall})\) is:

\[ P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall}) = \frac{P(Identify \text{ as tall} | Tall) \cdot P(Tall)}{P(Identify \text{ as tall})} \]

We first need to calculate \(P(Identify \text{ as tall})\), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as tall.

\[ P(Identify \text{ as tall}) = P(Identify \text{ as tall} | Tall) \cdot P(Tall) + P(Identify \text{ as tall} | Short) \cdot P(Short) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(Identify \text{ as tall}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(Identify \text{ as tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall})\):

\[ P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Tall | Identify \text{ as tall}) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
