To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen individual from the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen individual from the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
