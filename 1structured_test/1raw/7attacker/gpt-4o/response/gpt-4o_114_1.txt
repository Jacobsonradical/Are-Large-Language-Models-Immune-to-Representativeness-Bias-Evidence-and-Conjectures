To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they actually are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (80% correct identification for those 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller. This is given by the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Where:
- \( P(W | \neg T) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

So,

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
