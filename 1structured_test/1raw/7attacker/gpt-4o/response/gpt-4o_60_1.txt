To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter).

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
