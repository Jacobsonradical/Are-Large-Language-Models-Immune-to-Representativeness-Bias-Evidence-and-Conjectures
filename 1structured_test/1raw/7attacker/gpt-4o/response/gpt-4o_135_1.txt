To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in the context of this problem is the formula:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

Let's define the terms:
- \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \): The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.8 \): The probability the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Not Tall}) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) = 0.2 \): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.

Use the law of total probability to find \( P(\text{Identified Tall}) \):

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Not Tall}) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

{probability: 0.414}
