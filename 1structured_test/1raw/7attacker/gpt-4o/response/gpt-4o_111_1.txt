We can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events and apply the theorem accordingly:

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (errors 20% of the time).

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(H | W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

Thus, the answer in the required format is: 

{probability: 0.41}
