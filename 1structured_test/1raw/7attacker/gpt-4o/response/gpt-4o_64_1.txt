To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability based on the witness's identification reliability.

Here's the information given:
- Prior probability (\( P(H) \)): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- Prior probability (\( P(\neg H) \)): 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- Given the witness's reliability:
    - True positive rate (\( P(E|H) \)): 80% (witness correctly identifies when the person is 185 cm or taller).
    - False negative rate (\( P(E|\neg H) \)): 20% (witness incorrectly identifies when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We are interested in \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Next, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

So the final answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.414}
