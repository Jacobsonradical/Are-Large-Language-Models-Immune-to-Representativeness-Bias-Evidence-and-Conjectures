To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \) (The probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller is 80%)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is 20%)

We want to calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
