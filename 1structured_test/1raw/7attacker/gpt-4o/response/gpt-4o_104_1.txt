To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification and the prior probability of people's heights in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \(T\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \(P(T|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. This can be computed using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(W|T)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(T)\) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city.
- \(P(W)\) is the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\) (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W|T) = 0.80\) (the accuracy of the witness in correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W|\neg T) = 0.20\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate \(P(W)\), which is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Where:
- \(P(\neg T)\) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is \(1 - P(T) = 0.85\).

So,

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(T|W)\):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
