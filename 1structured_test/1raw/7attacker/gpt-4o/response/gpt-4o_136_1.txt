To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

Given:
- \( P(T) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
- \( P(S) \): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85%)
- \( P(W|T) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are = 0.80 (80%)
- \( P(W|S) \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter = 0.20 (20%)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the response in the specified format:
