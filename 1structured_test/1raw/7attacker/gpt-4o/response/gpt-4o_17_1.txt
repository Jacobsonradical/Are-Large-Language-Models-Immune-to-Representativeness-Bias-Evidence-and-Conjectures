To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information translated into probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \) is the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
2. \( P(B) \) is the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).
3. \( P(E | A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 (80%).
4. \( P(E | B) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (event E), \( P(A | E) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B) \]

First, let's calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A | E) \):

\[ P(A | E) = \frac{P(E | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(A | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
