To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- \( P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.85 \)
- The witness's accuracy: \( P(W \mid T \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W \mid T < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.2 \)

Where:
- \( T \) represents the height of the attacker.
- \( W \) represents the event where the witness identifies the attacker as being \( \geq 185 \text{ cm} \).

We need to find \( P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm})}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm}) + P(W \mid T < 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(T < 185 \text{ cm}) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Then, we can plug \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
