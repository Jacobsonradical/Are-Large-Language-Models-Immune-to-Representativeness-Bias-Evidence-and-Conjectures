To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's ability, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the population statistics, this is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness would identify a person as being 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(B) \), we consider two scenarios: when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and when the person is shorter than 185 cm.

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's error rate, this is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected person from the population is shorter than 185 cm. According to the population statistics, this is 85% or 0.85.

So, we have:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
