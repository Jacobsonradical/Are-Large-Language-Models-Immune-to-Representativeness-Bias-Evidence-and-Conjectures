To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the detailed calculation:

Let's define:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can find this using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, in the required format:
{probability: 0.414}
