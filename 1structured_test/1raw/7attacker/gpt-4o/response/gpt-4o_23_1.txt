To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \)

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore,
\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
