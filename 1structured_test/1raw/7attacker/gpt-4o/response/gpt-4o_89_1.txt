To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( H \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that someone randomly chosen from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

We should calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where:
- \( P(W | \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that someone randomly chosen from the population is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now, we can plug in the values:
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H | W) \):
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Here is the answer in the desired format:
{probability: 0.414}
