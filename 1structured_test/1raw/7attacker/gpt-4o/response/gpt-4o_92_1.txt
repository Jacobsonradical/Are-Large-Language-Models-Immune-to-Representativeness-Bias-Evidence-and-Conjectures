To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to determine \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

From the information provided:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \), the proportion of people 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \), the proportion of people shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.414.

Our final answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
