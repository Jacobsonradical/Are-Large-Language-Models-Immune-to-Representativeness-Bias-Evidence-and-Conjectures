To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The probability we want to find is \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
   - So, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
   - So, \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \).

3. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(E|\neg H) \)**:
   - The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
   - So, \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

4. **Prior Probability of \( \neg H \)**:
   - 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
   - So, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

5. **Total Probability, \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = 0.29
     \]

6. **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
