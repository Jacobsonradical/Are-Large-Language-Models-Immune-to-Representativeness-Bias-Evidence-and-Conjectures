To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's the breakdown of the information:
- \(P(T \geq 185)\): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \(P(T < 185)\): The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- \(P(E|T \geq 185)\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- \(P(E|T < 185)\): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.20
- \(E\): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \(P(T \geq 185|E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(T \geq 185|E) = \frac{P(E|T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(E)} \]

First, we determine \(P(E)\), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E|T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(E|T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \(P(T \geq 185|E)\):

\[ P(T \geq 185|E) = \frac{P(E|T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
