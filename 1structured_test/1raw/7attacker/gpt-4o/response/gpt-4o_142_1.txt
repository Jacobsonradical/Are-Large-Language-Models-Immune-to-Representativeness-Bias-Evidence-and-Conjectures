To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find: \( P(T | W) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Letâ€™s break this down step by step:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller. From information a, \( P(T) = 0.15 \).

2. \( P(W | T) \): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From information b, \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \).

3. \( P(W | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From information b, \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \).

4. \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. Since \( P(T) = 0.15 \), therefore \( P(\neg T) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \).

5. \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting in the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
