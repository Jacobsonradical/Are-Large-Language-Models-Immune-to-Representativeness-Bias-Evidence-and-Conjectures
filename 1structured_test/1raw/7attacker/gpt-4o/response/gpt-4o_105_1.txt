To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's specify the given probabilities:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(N) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. The likelihood of the witness's identification:
   - \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that a witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W | N) = 0.20 \) (the probability that a witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Next, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

First, compute \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | N) \cdot P(N)
\]

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T | W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
