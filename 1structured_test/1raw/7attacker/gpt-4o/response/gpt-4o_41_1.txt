To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T_0 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information provided:

- \( P(T_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T_0) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T_1) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W | T_0) = 0.2 \)

We want to find \( P(T_1 | W) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | T_1) \cdot P(T_1)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T_1) \cdot P(T_1) + P(W | T_0) \cdot P(T_0) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T_1 | W) \):

\[ P(T_1 | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_1 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_1 | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
