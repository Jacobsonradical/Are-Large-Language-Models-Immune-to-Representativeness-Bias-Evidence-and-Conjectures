We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information. 

Define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given probabilities:
- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of the population).
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% of the population).
- \( P(E | H_1) \): Probability of witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (80% accuracy).
- \( P(E | H_2) \): Probability of witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (20% error rate).

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
