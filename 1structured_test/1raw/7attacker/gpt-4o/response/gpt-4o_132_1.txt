To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A^C) = 0.85 \) (where \( A^C \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|A^C) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \). Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
