To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we need to calculate \( P(\text{tall}|\text{witness identified tall}) \).

Let's define our terms:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know from the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of the population are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (because the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (because 85% of the population are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (because the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
