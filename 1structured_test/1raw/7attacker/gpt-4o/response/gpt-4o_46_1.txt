To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps to compute it:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) \) = Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15.
   - \( P(T^c) \) = Probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% or 0.85.
   - \( P(W|T) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.80.
   - \( P(W|T^c) \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 20% or 0.20.

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T^c) \cdot P(T^c)
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(T|W) \):**
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) \approx 0.414
   \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
{probability: 0.414}
