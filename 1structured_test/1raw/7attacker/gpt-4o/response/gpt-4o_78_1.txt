To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probability \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We will use the following information from the problem:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness is correct when identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness is incorrect and identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability someone in the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H) = 0.85 \) (probability someone in the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4138}
