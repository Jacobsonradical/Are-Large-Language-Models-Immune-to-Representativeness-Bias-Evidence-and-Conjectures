To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Define events**:
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities**:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

3. **Using Bayes' theorem**:
   We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(W) \)**:
   \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their true height.
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(T|W) \)**:
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) \approx 0.414
   \]

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\{probability: 0.414\}
