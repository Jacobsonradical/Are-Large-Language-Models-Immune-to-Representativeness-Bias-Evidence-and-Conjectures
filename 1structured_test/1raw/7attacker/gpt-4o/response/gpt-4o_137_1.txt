To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and the city population, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process to determine this probability:

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Now we need to find each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   - This is given as 0.15 (or 15%).

2. \( P(W|T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
   - The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \).

3. \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
     \]
     Here, \( \neg T \) represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W|\neg T) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm.
     - Since the witness errs 20% of the time, \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \).
   - \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
     - This is given as 0.85 (or 85%).

So we calculate \( P(W) \) as:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
