To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (the witness's accuracy for identifying someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that a person in the population is shorter than 185 cm, which is \(1 - P(H) = 0.85\).
- The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter (\( P(W|\neg H) \)) is the error rate, which is \(0.20\).

The total probability \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|W) \):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
