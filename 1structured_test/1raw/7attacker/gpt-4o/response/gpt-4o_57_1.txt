To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population height distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The information given is:

1. The probability that the witness will correctly identify someone who is 185 cm or taller (\( P(W | H) \)) is 0.8.
2. The probability that the witness will incorrectly identify someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (\( P(W | \neg H) \)) is 0.2.
3. The prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population (\( P(H) \)) is 0.15.
4. The prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the population (\( P(\neg H) \)) is 0.85.

We aim to find the posterior probability \( P(H | W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
