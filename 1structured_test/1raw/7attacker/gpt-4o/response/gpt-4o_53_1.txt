To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Here is the setup of the probabilities according to the provided information:

1. P(H): Prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (or 15%).
2. P(W|H): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person actually is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.80 (or 80%).
3. P(W|¬H): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.20 (or 20%).
4. P(¬H): Prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.85 (or 85%).

We want to find P(H|W), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where P(W) (the total probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
