To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

We want to find \( P(H | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | E) \):
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
