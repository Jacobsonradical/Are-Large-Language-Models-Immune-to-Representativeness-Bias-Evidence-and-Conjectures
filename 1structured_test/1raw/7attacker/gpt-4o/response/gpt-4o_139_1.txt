Given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(H_1|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1|E) \):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.414}
