To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Let's compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
