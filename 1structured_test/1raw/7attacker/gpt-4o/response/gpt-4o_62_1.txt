To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(H_1\) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate:

1. \(P(H_1)\): The prior probability that any randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. \(P(E | H_1)\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
3. \(P(E)\): The total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
- \(P(H_0)\) (the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
- \(P(E | H_1) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E | H_0) = 0.2\)

First, we need to calculate \(P(E)\):

\[P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_0) P(H_0)\]

Plugging in the values:

\[P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)\]
\[P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(E) = 0.29\]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(H_1 | E)\):

\[P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)}\]
\[P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\{probability: 0.4138\}
