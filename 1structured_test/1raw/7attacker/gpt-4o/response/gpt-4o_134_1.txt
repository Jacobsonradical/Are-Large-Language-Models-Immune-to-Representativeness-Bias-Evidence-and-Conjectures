To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the necessary probabilities from the given information:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W | T) \): The probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
5. \( P(W) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The values are given as follows:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \)

First, let's find \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is \( \approx 0.414 \).
