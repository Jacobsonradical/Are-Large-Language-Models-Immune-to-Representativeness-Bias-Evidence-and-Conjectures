To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior probability (P(T≥185))**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this is 15% or 0.15.

2. **Complement of the prior (P(T<185))**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% or 0.85.

3. **Likelihood of correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller (P(W|T≥185))**: According to the information, the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time or 0.80.

4. **Likelihood of incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (P(W|T<185))**: The witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time or 0.20.

5. **Total probability of a witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (P(W))**: This can be calculated using the law of total probability.
   
   P(W) = P(W|T≥185) * P(T≥185) + P(W|T<185) * P(T<185)
       = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

6. **Posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem (P(T≥185|W))**: This is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
   
   P(T≥185|W) = (P(W|T≥185) * P(T≥185)) / P(W)
              = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
              = 0.12 / 0.29
              ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
