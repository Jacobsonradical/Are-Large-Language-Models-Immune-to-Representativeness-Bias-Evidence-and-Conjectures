To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis in light of new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \(\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.15\): The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.85\): The prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(\mathbb{P}(W | A) = 0.80\): The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(\mathbb{P}(W | B) = 0.20\): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

First, we need to determine the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (\(\mathbb{P}(W)\)):
\[
\mathbb{P}(W) = \mathbb{P}(W | A) \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(W | B) \mathbb{P}(B)
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(W) = 0.29
\]

Next, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (\(\mathbb{P}(A | W)\)):
\[
\mathbb{P}(A | W) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(W | A) \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(W)}
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(A | W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
\mathbb{P}(A | W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer is:

```
{probability: 0.4138}
