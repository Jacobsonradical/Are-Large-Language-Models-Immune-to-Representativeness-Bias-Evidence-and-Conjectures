We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. Here is the setup:

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate the probability \( P(H|W) \).

Given:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg H) \) is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- The probability \( P(W|H) \) is 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- The probability \( P(W|\neg H) \) is 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|W) \):

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
