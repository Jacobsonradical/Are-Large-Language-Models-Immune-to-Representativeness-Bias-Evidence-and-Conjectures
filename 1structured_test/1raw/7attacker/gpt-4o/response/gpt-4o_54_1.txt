To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

First, compute the terms:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

Now, plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Calculate the denominator:
\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]

Or to provide it rounded:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
