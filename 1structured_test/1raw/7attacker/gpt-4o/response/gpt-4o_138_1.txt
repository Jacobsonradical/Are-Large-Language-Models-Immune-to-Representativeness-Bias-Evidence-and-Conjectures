To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a summary of the approach:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(T) \):**
   This is the probability that someone chosen at random from the population is 185 cm or taller.
   \( P(T) = 0.15 \)

2. **Prior Probability \( P(F) \):**
   This is the probability that someone chosen at random from the population is shorter than 185 cm.
   \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

3. **Likelihood of Witness's Identification \( P(W|T) \):**
   This is the probability the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are that height.
   \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)

4. **Likelihood of Witness's Mistake \( P(W|F) \):**
   This is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than that height.
   \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

5. **Total Probability of Witness's Identification \( P(W) \):**
   This is the combined probability that the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, considering both true positives and false positives.
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(T|W) \):**
   This is the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \(0.4138\).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
