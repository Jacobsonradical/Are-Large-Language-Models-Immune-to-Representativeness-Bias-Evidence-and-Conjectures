To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1|W) \).

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone of height 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1|W) \):

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.41}
\]
