To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller (which is given as 0.8).
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (which is given as 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

To compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2).
- \( P(T^c) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85).

Plugging in values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
