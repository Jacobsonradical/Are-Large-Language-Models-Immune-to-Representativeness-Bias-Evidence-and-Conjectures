To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification and population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

**Step 1: Determine the prior probabilities**
 
From the population statistics:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(A') \): Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

**Step 2: Determine the likelihoods**

From the witness identification accuracy:
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- \( P(B|A') \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller = 0.20

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem**

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need \( P(B) \): the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We can get this by considering both cases:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification is:

{probability: 0.414}
