To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that event A (attacker is 185 cm or taller) occurs given event B (witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B given event A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event B.

Given the information:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.
- The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as tall is 80% or 0.80.
- The likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \) that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as tall is 20% or 0.20.

We need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
