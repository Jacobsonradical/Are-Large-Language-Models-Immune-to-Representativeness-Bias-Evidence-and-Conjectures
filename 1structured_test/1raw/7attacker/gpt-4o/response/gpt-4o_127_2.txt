To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

### Step 1: Identify the given probabilities

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(T) = 0.15
   \]

2. \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(\neg T) = 0.85
   \]

3. \( P(W \mid T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W \mid T) = 0.80
   \]

4. \( P(W \mid \neg T) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total probability \( P(W) \)

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

### Answer
{probability: 0.4138}
