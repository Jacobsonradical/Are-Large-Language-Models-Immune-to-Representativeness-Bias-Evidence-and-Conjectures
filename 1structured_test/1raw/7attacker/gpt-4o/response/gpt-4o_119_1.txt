Given the data, we're interested in calculating the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. To do this, we apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.41}
