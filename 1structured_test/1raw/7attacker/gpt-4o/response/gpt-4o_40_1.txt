To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Here are the definitions of the terms we'll use:
- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given probabilities from the problem:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a person from the city is 185 cm or taller: \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified a person \( \geq 185 \) cm as being 185 cm or taller: \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person \( < 185 \) cm as being 185 cm or taller: \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.20 \).

We need to find \( P(H | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | E) \):
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
