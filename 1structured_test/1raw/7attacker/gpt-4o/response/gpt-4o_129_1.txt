To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given data is:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.41 \} \]
