To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Let's define:
   - \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. We know:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm).

3. We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} 
\]

4. First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.29 
\]

5. Now, we can calculate \( P(H|W) \):

\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[ 
\{probability: 0.4138\} 
\]
