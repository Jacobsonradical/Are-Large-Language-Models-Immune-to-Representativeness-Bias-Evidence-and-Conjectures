We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(A') \) = Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.80.
- \( P(B|A') \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.20.

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we consider both possible cases:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

So:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
