To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said they were.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(W) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

We already have the given probabilities:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

Now, compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
