To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event given new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( A \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that any given person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (i.e., 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (i.e., the witness correctly identifies a height of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (i.e., 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (i.e., the witness incorrectly identifies a height of 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

\( P(B) \) is found through the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
