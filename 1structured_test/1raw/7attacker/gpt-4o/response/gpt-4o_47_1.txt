To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We already know:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(B | A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
- \( P(B | A') \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and half of the sample is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A'), \]

where \( P(A') \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now, substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

Calculating it step-by-step:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Next, we can plug \( P(B) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
