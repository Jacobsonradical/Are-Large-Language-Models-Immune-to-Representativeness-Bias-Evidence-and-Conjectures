To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayesian reasoning. We'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they really are 185 cm or taller (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.)

We need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Now substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]

Calculating each term separately:

\[ 0.80 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

\[ 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.17 \]

Adding these gives:

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
