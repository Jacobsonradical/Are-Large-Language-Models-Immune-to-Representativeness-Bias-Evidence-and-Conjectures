To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to define the components:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | A) \): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the data: 
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies 80% of those who are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | \text{not } A) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of those who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is done using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]
where \( P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification is approximately \( 0.41 \).

So, the answer is:
\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
