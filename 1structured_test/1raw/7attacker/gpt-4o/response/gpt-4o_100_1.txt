To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Known probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(W|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
   \]

   Calculate \( P(W) \):
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Now calculate \( P(H_1|W) \):**
   \[
   P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

So the final answer is:

\{probability: 0.414\}
