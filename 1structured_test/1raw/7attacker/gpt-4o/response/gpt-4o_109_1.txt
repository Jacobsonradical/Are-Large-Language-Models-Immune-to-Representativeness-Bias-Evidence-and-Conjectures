To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by considering both hypotheses:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
