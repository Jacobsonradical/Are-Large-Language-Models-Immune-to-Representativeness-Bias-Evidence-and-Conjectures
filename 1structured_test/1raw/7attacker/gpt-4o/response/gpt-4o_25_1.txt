To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
