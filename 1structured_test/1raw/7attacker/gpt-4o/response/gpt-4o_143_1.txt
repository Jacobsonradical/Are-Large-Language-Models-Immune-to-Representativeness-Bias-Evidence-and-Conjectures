To answer the question about the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to determine each component in the formula:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   - Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller: \( P(A) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(B | A) \)**: The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
   - Given the witness's accuracy, this is 80%, so \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \).

3. **\( P(B | A') \)**: The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm (where \( A' \) denotes the complement of \( A \)).
   - The witness makes errors 20% of the time when identifying height, so \( P(B | A') = 0.20 \).

4. **\( P(A') \)**: The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (the complement of \( P(A) \)).
   - Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(A') = 0.85 \).

5. **\( P(B) \)**: The total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
   - This can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the final answer:

{probability: 0.41}
