To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \(T\) = the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) = the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \(P(T|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}\]

Where:
- \(P(T)\) = prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W|T)\) = likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is that height.
- \(P(W)\) = total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W|T) = 0.80\) (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \(P(\neg T) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(W|\neg T) = 0.20\) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Now, we need to calculate \(P(W)\), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)\]

Substitute the known values:
\[P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)\]
\[P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(W) = 0.29\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(T|W) \approx 0.414\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s identification, is approximately:

\{probability: 0.414\}
