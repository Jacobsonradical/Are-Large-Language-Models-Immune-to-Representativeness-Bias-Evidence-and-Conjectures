To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(H \mid W)\) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \(P(W \mid H)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(W \mid H) = 0.80\)
- \(P(H) = 0.15\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.20\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to calculate \(P(W)\):

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \(P(H \mid W)\):

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H \mid W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
