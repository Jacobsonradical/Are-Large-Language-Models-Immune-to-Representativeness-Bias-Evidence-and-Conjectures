To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the information and apply the theorem.

Given:

1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (The complement, i.e., the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

We want to find \( P(H | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now plug in the numbers:

\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

Calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

Calculate \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, the answer is:
