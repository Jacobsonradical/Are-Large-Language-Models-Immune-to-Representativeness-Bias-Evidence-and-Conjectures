To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the details we'll be using:

1. Prior probability, \( P(\text{185 cm or taller}) = 0.15 \)
2. Prior probability, \( P(\text{shorter than 185 cm}) = 0.85 \)
3. Witness accuracy for 185 cm or taller, \( P(\text{Witness says 185+ | 185+}) = 0.80 \)
4. Witness error rate for 185 cm or taller, \( P(\text{Witness says 185+ | < 185}) = 0.20 \)

First, we need to find the total probability that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Witness says 185+}) = P(\text{Witness says 185+ | 185+}) \cdot P(\text{185+}) + P(\text{Witness says 185+ | < 185}) \cdot P(\text{< 185}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{Witness says 185+}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says 185+}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{185+ | Witness says 185+}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says 185+ | 185+}) \cdot P(\text{185+})}{P(\text{Witness says 185+})} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{185+ | Witness says 185+}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{185+ | Witness says 185+}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

The final answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
