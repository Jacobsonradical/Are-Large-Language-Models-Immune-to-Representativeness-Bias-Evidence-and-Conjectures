To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Here are the relevant pieces of information:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \): The probability that a person chosen at random from the population is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15.
- Complementary probability \( P(\neg H) \): The probability that a person chosen at random from the population is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person of height 185 cm or taller is 80%, or 0.8.
- Complementary likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 20%, or 0.2.

We seek to find the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Next, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
