To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(T | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W | T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller.

First, calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

where:
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\neg T) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Thus,
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
