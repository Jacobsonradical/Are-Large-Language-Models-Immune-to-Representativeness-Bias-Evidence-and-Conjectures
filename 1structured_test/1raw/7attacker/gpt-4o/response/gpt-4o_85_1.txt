To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process step-by-step:

Given:
- P(T): Probability of someone being taller than or equal to 185 cm = 0.15
- P(S): Probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- P(W|T): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as taller than 185 cm given they are taller = 0.80
- P(W|S): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as taller than 185 cm given they are shorter = 0.20

We need to find:
P(T|W): Probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes’ Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \times P(T) + P(W|S) \times P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
