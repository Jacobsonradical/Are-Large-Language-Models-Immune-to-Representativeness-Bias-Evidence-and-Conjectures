To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (our prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (our prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm).
- The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being tall 80% of the time: \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being tall 20% of the time: \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall:

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
