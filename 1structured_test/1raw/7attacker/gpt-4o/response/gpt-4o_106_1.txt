To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Denote the following:
- \( H \) = Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) = Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) = Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We can find \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

From the information:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)

So:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
