To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification and general population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(B) \), we need to account for both scenarios where the person is actually 185 cm or taller and where they are not:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:

- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20 (20% error rate).
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Substitute the values:

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification and population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, in the format requested:

{probability: 0.4138}
