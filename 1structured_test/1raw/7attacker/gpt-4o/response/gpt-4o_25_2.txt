To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use Bayes' Theorem, which updates the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Here, we are interested in the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (Hypothesis A).

Let's define:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the witness identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller correctly.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the witness identifying a shorter person (less than 185 cm) incorrectly.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where \( P(B) \) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
