To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_0 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(H_1) \)): 0.15
- Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(H_0) \)): 0.85
- Probability of witness correctly identifying a height of 185 cm or taller if true (\( P(E|H_1) \)): 0.80
- Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a height of 185 cm or taller if shorter (\( P(E|H_0) \)): 0.20

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_0) P(H_0) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting \( P(E) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ { probability: 0.414 } \]
