To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (\(H\)), we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let \(W\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have:
1. \(P(H) = 0.15\) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city)
2. \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the city)
3. \(P(W|H) = 0.80\) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
4. \(P(W|\neg H) = 0.20\) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \(P(H|W)\), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

To find \(P(W)\), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
