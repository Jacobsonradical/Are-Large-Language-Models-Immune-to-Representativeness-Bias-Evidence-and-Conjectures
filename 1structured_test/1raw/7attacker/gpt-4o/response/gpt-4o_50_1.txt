To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Now, let's find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is given by:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
