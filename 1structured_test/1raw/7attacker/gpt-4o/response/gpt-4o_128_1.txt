To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(L) \) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|L) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (since \( P(H) + P(L) = 1 \))
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|L) = 0.2 \)

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|L) \cdot P(L) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.41 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.41 \} \]
