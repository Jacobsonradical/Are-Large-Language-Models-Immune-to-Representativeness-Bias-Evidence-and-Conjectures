To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem gives us a way to update our beliefs given new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Let's break down each component:
- \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the population data, \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W | T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.80.
- \( P(W | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.20.

Now, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
