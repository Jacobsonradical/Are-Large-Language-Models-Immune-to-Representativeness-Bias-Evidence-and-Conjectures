To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- P(\(W | H\)) = 0.80 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(\(W | H^c\)) = 0.20 (Probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(\(H\)) = 0.15 (Prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(\(H^c\)) = 0.85 (Prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(H | W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80) \cdot (0.15) + (0.20) \cdot (0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
