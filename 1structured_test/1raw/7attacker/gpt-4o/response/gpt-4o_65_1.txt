To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayesian inference. We'll denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H) \) as the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \) as the likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness falsely identifies height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not)

We need to find \( P(H | E) \), the posterior probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The total probability \( P(E) \) is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is about 0.4138 or 41.38%.
