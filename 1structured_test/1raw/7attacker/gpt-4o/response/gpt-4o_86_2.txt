To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that any given person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

Given the data:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (since 20% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller)

We need to find \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
