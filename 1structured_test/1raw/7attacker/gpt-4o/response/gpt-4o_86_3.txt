To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
