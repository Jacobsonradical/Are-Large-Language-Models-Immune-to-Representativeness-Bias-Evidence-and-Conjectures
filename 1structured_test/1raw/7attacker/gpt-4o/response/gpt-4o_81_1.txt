To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to compute \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We know the following:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy for taller individuals, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate for shorter individuals, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\neg T) \) is the prior probability that a random person from the population is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
