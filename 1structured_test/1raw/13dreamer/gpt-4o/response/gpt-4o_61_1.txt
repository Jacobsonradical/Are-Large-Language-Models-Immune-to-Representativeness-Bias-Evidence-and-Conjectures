Given that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Based on the information provided:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
