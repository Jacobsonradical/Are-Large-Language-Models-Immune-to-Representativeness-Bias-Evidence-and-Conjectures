Given that mating with respect to dreaming is completely random, we can determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer based on the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

We are told that:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
