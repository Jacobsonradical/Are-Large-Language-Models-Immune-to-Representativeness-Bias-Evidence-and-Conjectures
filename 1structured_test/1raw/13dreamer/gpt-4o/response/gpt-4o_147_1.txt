First, let’s outline the given probabilities:

- The probability of a person being a Dreamer (D) is 80%, or 0.80.
- The probability of a person being a Nondreamer (ND) is 20%, or 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person in the population being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
