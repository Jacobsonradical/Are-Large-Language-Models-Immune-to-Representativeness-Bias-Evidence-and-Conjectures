Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we need to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

From the problem, we know that:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.

Since mating is random, the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is independent of the other individual's dreaming classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
