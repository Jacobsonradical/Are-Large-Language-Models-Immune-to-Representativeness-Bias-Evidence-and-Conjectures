Given that 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% as Nondreamers, the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since mating with respect to dreaming is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
