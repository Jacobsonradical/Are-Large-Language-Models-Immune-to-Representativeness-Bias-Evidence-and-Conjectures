Given that 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, because mating is described as completely random with respect to dreaming. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
