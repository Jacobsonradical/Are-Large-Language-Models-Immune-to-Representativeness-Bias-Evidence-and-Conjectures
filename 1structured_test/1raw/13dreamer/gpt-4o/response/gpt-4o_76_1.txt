The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the information provided, which states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, this translates to:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the likelihood that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be equal to the general proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
