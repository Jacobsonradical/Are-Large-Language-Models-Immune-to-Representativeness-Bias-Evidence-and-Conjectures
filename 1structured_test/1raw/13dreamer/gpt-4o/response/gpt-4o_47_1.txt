To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

{probability: 0.20}
