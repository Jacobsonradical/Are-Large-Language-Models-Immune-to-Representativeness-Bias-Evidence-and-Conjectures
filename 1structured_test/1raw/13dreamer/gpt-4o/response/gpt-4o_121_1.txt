To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the general population.

Based on the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is directly related to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
