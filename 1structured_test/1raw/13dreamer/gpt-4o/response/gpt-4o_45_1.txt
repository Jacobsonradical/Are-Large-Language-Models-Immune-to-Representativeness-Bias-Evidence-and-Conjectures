Given that the probability a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is \(0.20\), we assume that mating is random with respect to dreaming, as stated in the problem.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

The answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
