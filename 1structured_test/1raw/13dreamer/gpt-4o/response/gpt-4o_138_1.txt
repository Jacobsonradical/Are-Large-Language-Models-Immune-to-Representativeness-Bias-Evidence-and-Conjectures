Given that dreaming is completely random with respect to mating, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be directly derived from the general population statistics. If 20% of the population are Nondreamers, then the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20%.

So, the answer can be expressed as:
{probability: 0.20}
