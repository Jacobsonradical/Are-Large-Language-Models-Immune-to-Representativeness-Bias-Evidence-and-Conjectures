Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer based on the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population. 

From the given information:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
