Given that dreaming is random with respect to mating, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is given by:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \]

So, in the requested format:

\{probability: 0.2\}
