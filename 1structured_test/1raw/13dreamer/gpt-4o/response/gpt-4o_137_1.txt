Since mating is considered completely random with respect to dreaming status, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population. 

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
