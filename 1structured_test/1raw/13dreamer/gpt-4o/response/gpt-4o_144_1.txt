Given the information provided:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Brett is a Nondreamer, so we want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

So the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.2}
