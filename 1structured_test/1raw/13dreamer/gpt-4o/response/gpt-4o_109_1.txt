Given that dreaming and nondreaming are randomly distributed and that the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%, or 0.20.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
