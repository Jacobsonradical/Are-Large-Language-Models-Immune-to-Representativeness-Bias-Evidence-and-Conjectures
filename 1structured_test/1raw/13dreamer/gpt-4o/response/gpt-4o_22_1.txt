To determine the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Given that the mating is completely random, the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).

{probability: 0.2}
