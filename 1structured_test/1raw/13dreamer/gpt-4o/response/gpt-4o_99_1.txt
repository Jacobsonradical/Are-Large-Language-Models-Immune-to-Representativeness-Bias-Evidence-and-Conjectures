Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, with mating being completely random, can be calculated as follows:

If the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, then the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
