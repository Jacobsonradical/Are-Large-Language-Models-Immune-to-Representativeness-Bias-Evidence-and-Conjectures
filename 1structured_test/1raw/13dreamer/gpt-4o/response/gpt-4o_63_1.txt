Given that the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is evenly spread with probabilities of 0.8 for "Dreamers" and 0.2 for "Nondreamers", and assuming that mating (marriage) is completely random, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife, being selected from the general population, is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that any random person is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
