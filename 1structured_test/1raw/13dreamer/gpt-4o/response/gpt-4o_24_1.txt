To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

- 80% (or 0.8) of people are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% (or 0.2) of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since the mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
