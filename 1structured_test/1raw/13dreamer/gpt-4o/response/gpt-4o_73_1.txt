Given that mating is completely random regarding dreaming status, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer based on the overall proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

As mentioned, 20% of the population are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
