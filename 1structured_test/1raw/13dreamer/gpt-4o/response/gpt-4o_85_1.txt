Given that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2, and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the likelihood that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of picking another Nondreamer from the general population.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
