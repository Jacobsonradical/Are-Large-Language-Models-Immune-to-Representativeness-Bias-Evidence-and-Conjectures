To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that mating is random with respect to dreaming, we need to look at the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

We are given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people report that they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is \( 0.20 \) (or 20%).

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
