Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can use the provided percentages directly to determine the probability.

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be directly derived from the given percentage of Nondreamers in the general population.

Thus, the probability is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.2}
