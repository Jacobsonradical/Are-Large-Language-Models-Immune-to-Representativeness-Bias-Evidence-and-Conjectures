Based on the information provided, 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
