Given that mating is completely random and the provided statistics indicate 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated directly using this information. 

The probability is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
