Given that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2), and assuming that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
