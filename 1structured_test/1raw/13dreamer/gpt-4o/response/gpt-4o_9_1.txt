To solve this problem, we start with the given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer. This is given as 20%, or 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
