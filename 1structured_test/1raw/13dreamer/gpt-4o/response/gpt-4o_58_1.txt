Given that the classification of individuals into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is such that 20% of people are Nondreamers, we can treat the determination of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer as an independent event. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
