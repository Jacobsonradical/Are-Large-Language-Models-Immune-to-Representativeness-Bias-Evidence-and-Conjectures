Given the data provided, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
