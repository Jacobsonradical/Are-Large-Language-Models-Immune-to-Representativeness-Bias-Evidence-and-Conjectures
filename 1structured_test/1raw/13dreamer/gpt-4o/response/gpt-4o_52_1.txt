Given the information that mating is completely random and that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer by simply using the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
