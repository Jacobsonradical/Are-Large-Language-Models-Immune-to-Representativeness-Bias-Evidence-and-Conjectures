Given the information that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is exactly the same as the general probability in the population.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.2}
