To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to remember that mating is random, and the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20% or 0.20. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.20}
