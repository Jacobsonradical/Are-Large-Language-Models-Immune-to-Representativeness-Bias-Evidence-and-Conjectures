Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, and considering the percentages provided:

- 20% (or 0.2) of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% (or 0.8) of people are Dreamers.

Since the pairing is random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
