Given that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.20) and that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated directly from the given probability.

Since Brett's wife is chosen randomly with respect to dreaming, the probability that she is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
