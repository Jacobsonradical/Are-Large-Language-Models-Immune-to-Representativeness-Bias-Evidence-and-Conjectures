Given that 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers) and 20% claim they do not (Nondreamers), we assume the population is divided as follows:

- Dreamers (D): 80% or 0.80
- Nondreamers (ND): 20% or 0.20

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person from the population is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
