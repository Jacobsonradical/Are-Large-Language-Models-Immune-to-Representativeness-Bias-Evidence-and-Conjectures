Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and knowing that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
