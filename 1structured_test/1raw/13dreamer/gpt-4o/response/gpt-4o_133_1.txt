Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, we need to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, assuming mating is random.

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
