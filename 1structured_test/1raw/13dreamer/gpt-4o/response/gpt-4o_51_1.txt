To solve for the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can use the information given about the population:

1. 80% of people are Dreamers.
2. 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%, or 0.20.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
