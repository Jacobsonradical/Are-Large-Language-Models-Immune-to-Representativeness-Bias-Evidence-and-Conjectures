To solve this problem, we will use the probabilities given in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Brett is a Nondreamer. To find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to look at the general population distribution since mating is completely random.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
