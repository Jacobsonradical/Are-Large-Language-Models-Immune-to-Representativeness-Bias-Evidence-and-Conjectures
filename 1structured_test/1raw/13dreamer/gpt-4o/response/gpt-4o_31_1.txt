To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that mating is completely random:

1. The overall prevalence of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.
2. Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall prevalence of Nondreamers in the population.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
