Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming status, we can use the overall population proportions to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

According to the information, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
