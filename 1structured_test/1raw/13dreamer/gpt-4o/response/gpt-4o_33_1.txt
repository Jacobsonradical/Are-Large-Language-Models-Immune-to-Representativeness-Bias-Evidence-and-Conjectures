Given the data:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
