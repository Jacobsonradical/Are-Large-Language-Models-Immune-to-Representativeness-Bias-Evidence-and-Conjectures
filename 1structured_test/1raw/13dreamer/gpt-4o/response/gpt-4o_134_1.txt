Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can calculate the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer using the given data. Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
