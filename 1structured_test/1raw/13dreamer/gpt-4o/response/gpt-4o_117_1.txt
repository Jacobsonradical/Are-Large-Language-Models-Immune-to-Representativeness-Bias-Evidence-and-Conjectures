Based on the information provided, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as Nondreamers. This implies the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would simply be the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
