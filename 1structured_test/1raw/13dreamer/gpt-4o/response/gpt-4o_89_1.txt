Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can use the percentages provided to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
