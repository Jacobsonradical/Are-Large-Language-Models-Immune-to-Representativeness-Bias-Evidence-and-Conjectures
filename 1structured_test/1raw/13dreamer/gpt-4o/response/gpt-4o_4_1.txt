To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the general population. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, we can assume that the probability that anyone randomly chosen is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Because mating is described as completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person in the population is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
