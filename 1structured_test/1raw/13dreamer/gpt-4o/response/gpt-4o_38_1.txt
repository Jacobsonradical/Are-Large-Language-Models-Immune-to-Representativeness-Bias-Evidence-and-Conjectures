The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, since mating is described as completely random with respect to dreaming. 

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
