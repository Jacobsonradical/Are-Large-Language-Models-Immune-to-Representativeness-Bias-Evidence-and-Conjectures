The probabilities given in the scenario indicate that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers." Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any randomly chosen person being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Here is the formatted answer:

{probability: 0.20}
