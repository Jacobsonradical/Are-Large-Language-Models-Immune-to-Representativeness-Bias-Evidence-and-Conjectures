Given the information that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, we can use this to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. 

Since dreaming and mating are random and independent with respect to each other, the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer is simply equal to the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
