To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the overall distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population, which is provided in the problem statement.

According to the information given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
