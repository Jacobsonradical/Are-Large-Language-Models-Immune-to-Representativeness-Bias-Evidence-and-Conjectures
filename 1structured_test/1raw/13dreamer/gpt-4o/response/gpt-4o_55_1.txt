Given that mating is completely random and 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability \( P \) that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Thus, \( P = 0.20 \).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
