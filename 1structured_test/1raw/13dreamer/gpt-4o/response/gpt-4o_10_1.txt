Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%. Mating being completely random means this percentage is directly applicable.

Let's convert this percentage to a probability between 0 and 1.

20% = 0.20

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
