Given that the mating is random with respect to dreaming and we know Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

According to the given data:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a decimal.

{probability: 0.2}
