Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is random and independent, we have the following probabilities:

- Probability of a person being a Nondreamer: 20% or 0.20
- Probability of a person being a Dreamer: 80% or 0.80

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of any randomly chosen person being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
