Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be determined by the proportion of Nondreamers in the population. 

We are told that 20% of the population are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
