Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should be the same as the general proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

As stated, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
