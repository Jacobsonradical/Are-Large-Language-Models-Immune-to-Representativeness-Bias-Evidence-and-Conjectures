To solve this problem, we need to use the given percentages of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

If mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability that any randomly chosen person from the population is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
