To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we use the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
