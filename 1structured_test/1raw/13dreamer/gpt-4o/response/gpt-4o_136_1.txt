Given that mating with respect to dreaming is completely random, and we are told that 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
