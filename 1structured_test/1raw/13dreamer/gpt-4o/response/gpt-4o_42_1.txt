Given that dreaming status is independent and mating is completely random, we can calculate the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer. 

We know:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Therefore, the probability that any given person (including Brett's wife) is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
