To solve this problem, we need to understand the probabilities involved. According to the information given:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Given that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%, or 0.2.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be expressed as:
{probability: 0.2}
