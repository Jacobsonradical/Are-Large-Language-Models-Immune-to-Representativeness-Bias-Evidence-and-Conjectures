Given that the study shows 20% of people are Nondreamers, we can assume that this demographic distribution applies uniformly across the population, including Brett's wife.
 
Since mating is described as completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
