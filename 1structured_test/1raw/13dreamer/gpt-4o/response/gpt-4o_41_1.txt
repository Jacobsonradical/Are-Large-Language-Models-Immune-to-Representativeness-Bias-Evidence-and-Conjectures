Given that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20, we are asked to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
