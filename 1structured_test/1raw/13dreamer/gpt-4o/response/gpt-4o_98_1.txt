Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we are interested in finding the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, and the given data tells us that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
