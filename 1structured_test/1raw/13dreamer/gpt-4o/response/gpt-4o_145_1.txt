Given that 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% as Nondreamers, and assuming that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife, chosen at random from the population, is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
