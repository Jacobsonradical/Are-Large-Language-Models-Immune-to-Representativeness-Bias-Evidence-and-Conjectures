Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. 

From the information given, 20% of the population are Nondreamers. This means the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since the problem states that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
