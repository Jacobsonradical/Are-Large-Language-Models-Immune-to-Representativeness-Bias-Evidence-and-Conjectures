Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be determined by the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

From the information provided:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is therefore the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
