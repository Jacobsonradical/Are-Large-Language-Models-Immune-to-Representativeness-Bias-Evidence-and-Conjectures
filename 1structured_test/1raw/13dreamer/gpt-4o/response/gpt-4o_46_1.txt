To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given statistics about the population:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, Brett's partner can be categorized with the same probability distribution as the general population. This means that, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as in the general population.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is therefore 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal.

{probability: 0.2}
