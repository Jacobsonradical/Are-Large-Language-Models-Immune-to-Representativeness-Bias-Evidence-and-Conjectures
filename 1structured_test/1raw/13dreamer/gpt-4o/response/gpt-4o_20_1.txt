Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that a randomly chosen person (like Brett's wife) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
