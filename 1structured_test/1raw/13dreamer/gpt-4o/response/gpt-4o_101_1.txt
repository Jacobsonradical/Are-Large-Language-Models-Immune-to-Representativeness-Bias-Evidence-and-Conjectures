Given the information in the problem:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we simply need to use the proportion of Nondreamers in the population. Since mating is random, the proportion of Nondreamers in the population will be the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
