To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we use the given data that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer = 0.20

Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
