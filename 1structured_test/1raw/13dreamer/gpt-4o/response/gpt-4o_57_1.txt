Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
