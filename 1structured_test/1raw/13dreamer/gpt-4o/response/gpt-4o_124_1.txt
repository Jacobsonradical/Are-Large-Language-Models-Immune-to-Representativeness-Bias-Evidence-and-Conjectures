Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, let's denote the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
