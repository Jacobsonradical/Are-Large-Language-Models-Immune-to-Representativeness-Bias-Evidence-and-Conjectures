Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

We know:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

\[{probability: 0.20}\]
