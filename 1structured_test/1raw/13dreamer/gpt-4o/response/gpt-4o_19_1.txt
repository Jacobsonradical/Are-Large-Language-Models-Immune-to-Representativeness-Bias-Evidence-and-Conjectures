Given the information that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be directly derived from the overall prevalence of Nondreamers in the population.

From the study, we know:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
