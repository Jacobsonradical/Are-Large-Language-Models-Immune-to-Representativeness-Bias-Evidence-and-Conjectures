Given that dreaming behavior in the population is random with respect to mating, we can use the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers to calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a nondreamer. 

We know:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer (in a random mating scenario) is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a decimal.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
