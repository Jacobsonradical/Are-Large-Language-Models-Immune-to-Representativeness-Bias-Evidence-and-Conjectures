Given the information provided, we know that:

- 80% of people (both sexes) are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
