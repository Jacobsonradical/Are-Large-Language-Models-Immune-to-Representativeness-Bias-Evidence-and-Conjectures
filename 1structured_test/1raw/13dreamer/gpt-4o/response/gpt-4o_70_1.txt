Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.

We know from the question that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
