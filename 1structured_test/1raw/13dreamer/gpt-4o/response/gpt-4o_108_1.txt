Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that any randomly chosen person (including Brett's wife) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can directly use this probability.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
