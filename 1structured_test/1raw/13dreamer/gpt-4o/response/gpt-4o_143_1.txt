To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given statistics. Since mating (marriage) is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can assume that the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is equal regardless of their partner's dreaming status.

Given:
- Probability of being a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.20
- Probability of being a Dreamer = 80% = 0.80

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
