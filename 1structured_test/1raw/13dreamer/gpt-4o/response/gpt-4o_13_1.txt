To answer this question, we need to use the information given about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. Specifically, 80% (0.8) of people are Dreamers, and 20% (0.2) are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%.

Using the format requested:

{probability: 0.2}
