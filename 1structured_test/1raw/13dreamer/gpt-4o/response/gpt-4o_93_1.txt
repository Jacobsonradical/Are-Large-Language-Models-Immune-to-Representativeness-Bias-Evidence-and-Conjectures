Given that the likelihood of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.20), and since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming status, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated directly using this proportion.

So the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or in fractional terms, 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
