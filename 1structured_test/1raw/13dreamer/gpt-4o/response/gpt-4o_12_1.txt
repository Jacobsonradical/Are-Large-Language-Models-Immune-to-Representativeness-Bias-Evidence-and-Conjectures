Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer himself. Therefore, we can directly use the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population to determine this probability.

The proportion of Nondreamers in the general population is 20%, or 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
