Given that dreaming and nondreaming status is random and independent, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

- The probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer (P(Nondreamer)) is 20% or 0.2.
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is a Dreamer (P(Dreamer)) is 80% or 0.8.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probabilities of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer are the same as those for the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
