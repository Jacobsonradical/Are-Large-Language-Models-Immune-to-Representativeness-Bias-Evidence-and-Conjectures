The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be derived from the given distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the general population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Assuming that mating is completely random, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

So, the probability \( P \) that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (i.e., 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
