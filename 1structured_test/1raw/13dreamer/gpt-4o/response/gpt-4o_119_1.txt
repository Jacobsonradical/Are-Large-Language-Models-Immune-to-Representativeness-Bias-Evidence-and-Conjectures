Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and assuming that mate selection is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be determined as follows:

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife belongs to this group is also 20%.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
