Given the information that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
