Given that dreaming traits are randomly distributed and considering that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. We know from the data that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

This probability remains the same irrespective of Brett's status because mating is random with respect to dreaming. Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same 20%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
