Given the information that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own classification due to mating being completely random with respect to dreaming.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
