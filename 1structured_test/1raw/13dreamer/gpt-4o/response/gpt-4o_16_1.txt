Given that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own classification as a Nondreamer. The probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer can be determined from the given statistics.

According to the information provided, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
