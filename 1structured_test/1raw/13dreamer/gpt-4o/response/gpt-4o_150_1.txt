Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, we need to determine the probability that Brett, who is a Nondreamer, has a wife who is also a Nondreamer. Since mating is completely random, the occurrence of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate in the population, which is 20%, or 0.20 in probability terms.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
