To determine the probability that Brett, a Nondreamer, has a wife who is also a Nondreamer, we need to understand the general distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. As given:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer (given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers) is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
