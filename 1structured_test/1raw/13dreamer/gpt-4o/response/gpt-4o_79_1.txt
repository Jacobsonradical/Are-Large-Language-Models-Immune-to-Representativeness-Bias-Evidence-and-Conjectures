Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be determined by the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

This is because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.
