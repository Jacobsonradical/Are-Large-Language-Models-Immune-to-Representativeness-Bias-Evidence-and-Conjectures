Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can use the provided statistics to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. 

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer, we simply take the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.20.

So the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
