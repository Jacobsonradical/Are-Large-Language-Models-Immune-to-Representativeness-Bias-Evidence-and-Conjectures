Given the problem, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and mating is completely random. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer in the population. Since the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
