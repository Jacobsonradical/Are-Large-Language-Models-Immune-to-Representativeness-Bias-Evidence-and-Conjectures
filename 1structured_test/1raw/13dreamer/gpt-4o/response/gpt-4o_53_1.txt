Given that dreaming status is independent for each individual and mating is completely random, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer based purely on the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
