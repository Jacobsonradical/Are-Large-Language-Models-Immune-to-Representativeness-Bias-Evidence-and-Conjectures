The problem states that 20% of the population are Nondreamers. Assuming mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Therefore, the probability is 0.2.

So the formatted answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
