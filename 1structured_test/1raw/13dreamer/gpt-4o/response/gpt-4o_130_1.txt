Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers and mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be found by considering the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
