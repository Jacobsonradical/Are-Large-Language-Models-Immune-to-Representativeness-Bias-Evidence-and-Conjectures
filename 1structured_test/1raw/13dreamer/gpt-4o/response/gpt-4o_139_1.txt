Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent and mating (marriage) is random with respect to dreaming, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer using the given percentages.

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the probability is independent, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
