{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own status as a Nondreamer. The probability is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
