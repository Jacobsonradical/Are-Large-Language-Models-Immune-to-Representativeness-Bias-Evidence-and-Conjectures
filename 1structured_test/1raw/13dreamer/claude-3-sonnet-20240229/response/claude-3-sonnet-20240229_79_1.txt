To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
