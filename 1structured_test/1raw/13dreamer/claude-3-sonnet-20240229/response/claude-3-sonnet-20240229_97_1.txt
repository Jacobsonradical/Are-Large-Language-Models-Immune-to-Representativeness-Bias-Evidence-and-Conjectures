{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of people who are Nondreamers, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
