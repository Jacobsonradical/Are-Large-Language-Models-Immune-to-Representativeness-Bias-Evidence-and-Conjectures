To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
