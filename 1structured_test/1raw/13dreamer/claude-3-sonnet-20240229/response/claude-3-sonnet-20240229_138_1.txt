{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- In the population, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
