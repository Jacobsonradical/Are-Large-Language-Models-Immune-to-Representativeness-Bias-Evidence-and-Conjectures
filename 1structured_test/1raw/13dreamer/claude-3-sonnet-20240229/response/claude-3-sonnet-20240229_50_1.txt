{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
