To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the following events:
A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We need to find P(A|B), which is the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the principle of independent events, we have:
P(A|B) = P(A)

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
P(A) = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
