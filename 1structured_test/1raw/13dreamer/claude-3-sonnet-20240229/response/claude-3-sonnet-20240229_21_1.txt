{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers
- 80% of people are Dreamers

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
