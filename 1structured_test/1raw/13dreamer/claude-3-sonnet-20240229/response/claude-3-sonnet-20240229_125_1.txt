{probability: 0.2}

To arrive at this answer, we need to consider the following:

1. The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."
2. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own status as a Nondreamer.
3. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
