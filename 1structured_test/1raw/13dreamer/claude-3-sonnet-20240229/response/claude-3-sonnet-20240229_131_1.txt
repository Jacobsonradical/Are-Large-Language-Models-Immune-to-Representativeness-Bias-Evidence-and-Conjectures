To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
