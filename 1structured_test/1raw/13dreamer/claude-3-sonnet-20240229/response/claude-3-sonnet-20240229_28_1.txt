To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of people who are classified as Nondreamers, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
