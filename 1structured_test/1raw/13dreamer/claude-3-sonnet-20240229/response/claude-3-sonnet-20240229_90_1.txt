To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

We know that P(B) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).
We also know that P(A) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).
Since mating is completely random, the event of being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B) = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.2 × 0.2) / 0.2
P(A|B) = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
