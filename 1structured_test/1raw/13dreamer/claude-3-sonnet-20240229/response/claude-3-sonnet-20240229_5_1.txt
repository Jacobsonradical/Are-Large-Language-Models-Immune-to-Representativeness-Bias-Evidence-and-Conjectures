To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. The probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- Proportion of Nondreamers = 0.2 or 20%

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
