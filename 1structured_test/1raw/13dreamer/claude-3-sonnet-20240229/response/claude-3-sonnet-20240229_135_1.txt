{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The population is divided into two groups: "Dreamers" (80%) and "Nondreamers" (20%).
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), as mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- The probability of selecting two "Nondreamers" from the population is the product of their individual probabilities, which is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04 (or 4%).
- However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer. In this case, the probability is simply 0.2 (or 20%), as the two events are independent.
