{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" who do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 or 20%, which is the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
- The probability that someone is a Nondreamer is independent of whether their spouse is a Nondreamer or not, assuming random mating.
