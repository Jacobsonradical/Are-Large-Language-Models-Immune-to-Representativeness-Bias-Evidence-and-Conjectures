{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", which means that the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
