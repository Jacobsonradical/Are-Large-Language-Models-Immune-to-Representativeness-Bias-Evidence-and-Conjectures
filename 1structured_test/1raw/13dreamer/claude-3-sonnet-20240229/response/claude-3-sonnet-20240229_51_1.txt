To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's denote the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as W.

The probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer because mating is random with respect to dreaming.

Therefore, the probability of W is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
