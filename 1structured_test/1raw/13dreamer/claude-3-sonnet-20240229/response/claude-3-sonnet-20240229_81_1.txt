{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The population is divided into two groups: "Dreamers" (80%) and "Nondreamers" (20%).
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- This is because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's dreaming status.
