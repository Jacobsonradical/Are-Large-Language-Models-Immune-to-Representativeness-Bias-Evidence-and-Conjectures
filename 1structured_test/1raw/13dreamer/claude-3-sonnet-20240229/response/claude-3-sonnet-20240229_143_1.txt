To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
