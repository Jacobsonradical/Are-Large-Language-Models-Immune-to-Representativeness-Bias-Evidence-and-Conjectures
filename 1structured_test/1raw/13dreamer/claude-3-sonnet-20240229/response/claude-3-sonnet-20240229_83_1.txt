{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
