To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
