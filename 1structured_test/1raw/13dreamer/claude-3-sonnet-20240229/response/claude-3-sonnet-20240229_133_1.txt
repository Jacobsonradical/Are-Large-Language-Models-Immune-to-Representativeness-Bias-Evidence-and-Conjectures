To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to know the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
