{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- Given that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming
- The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

So the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, like himself, is 0.2.
