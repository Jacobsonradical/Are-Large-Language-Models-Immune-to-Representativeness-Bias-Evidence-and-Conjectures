To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- Mating is random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
