{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
