To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random (independent events).

Let's denote the event that a person is a Nondreamer as N.

We want to find P(Wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(Wife's N | Brett's N)

Since mating is random, the events are independent. Therefore, we can use the multiplication rule:

P(Wife's N | Brett's N) = P(Wife's N) = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
