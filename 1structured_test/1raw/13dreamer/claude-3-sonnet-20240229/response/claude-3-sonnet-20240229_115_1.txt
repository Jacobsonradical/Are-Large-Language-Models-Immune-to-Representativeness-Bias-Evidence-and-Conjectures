{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2 (given in the question).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2, which is the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.
