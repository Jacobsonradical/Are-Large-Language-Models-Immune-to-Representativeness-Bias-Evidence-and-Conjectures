To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the population proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
