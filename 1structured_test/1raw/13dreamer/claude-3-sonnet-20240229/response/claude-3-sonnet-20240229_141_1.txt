{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream)
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
