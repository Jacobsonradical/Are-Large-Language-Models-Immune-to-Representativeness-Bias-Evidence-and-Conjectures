To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.2 (or 20%)

{probability: 0.2}
