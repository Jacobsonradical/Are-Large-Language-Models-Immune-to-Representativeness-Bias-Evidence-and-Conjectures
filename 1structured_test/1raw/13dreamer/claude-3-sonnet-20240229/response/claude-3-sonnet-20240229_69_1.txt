To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population is 0.2 or 20%.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
