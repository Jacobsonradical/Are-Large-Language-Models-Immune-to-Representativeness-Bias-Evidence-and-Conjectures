To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's denote the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as A.

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of event A using the given information about the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

P(A) = Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
P(A) = 0.2 (since 20% of the population are Nondreamers)

{probability: 0.2}
