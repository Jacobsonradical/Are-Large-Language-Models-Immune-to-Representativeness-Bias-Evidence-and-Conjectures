To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

By the definition of conditional probability:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

We know that P(B) = 0.2, since 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Now, we need to find P(A and B), which is the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random, the events A and B are independent. Therefore:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
P(A and B) = 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.04

Substituting the values in the conditional probability formula:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.04 / 0.2 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
