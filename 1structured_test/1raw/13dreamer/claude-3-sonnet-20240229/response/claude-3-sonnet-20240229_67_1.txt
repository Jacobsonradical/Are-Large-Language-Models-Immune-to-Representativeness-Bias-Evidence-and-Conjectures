{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
- Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 (20%), which is the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
