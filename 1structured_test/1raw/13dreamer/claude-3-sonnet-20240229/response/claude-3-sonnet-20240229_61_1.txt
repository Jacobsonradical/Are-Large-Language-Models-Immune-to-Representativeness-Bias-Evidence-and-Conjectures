{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The population is divided into two groups: Dreamers (80%) and Nondreamers (20%).
- Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
