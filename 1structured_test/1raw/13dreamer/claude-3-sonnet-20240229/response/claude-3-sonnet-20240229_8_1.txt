To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people (or 0.8) are Dreamers, and 20% (or 0.2) are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 0.2.
