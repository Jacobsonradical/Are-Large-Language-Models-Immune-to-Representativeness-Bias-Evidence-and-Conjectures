{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The probability that an individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
