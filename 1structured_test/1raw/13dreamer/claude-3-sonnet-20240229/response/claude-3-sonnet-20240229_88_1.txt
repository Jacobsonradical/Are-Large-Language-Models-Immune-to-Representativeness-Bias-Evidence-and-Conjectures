To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people (both sexes) are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's dreaming status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers)

{probability: 0.2}
