To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of people classified as Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
