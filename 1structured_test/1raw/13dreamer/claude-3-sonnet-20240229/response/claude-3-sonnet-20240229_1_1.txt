To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to know the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
