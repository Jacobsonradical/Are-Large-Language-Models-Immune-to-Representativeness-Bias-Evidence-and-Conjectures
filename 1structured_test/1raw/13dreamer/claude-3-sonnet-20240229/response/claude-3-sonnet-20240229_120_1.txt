{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's dreaming status.
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.
