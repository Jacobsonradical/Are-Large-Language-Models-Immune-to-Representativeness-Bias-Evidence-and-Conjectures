To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to know the probability that an individual is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Probability that an individual is a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
