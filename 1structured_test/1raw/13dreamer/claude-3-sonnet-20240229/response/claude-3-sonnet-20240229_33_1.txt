To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of event A (Brett's wife is a Nondreamer) given event B (Brett is a Nondreamer).

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the events A and B are independent. Therefore, we can use the following formula:

P(A|B) = P(A)

P(A) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
