To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
