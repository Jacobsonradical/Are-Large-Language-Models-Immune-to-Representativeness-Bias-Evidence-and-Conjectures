{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%) for any individual, regardless of their partner's status.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 (20%), which is the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.
