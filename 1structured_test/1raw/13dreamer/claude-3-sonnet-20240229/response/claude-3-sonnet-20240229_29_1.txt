To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
