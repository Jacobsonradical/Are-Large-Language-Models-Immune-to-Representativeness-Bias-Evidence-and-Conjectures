{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are "Nondreamers" and do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
