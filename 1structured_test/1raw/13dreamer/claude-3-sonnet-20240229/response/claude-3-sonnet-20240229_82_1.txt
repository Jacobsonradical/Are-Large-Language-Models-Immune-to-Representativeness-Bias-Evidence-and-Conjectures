{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
