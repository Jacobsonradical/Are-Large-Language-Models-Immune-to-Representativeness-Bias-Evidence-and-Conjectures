To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating with respect to dreaming is completely random.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Proportion of Nondreamers in the population
= 0.2 or 20%

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
