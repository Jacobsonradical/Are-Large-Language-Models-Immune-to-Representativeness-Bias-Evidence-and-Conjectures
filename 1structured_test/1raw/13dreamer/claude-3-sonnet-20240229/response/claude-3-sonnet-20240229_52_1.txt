To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
