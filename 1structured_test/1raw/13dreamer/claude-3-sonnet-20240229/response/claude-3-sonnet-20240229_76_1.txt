To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- The mating process is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since the mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
