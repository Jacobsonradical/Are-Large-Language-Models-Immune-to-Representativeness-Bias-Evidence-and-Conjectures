{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
- The probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is given as 20% or 0.2.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
