{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The population is divided into "Dreamers" (80%) and "Nondreamers" (20%).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
