To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
