{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (they report dreaming, if only occasionally).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

The probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%).
