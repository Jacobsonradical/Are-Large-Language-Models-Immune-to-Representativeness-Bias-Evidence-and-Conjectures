To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the events A and B are independent. Therefore, we can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A)

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, P(A), is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is:

{probability: 0.2}
