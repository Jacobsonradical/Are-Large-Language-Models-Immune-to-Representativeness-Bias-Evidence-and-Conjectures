{probability: 0.2}

To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of people who are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 or 20%.
