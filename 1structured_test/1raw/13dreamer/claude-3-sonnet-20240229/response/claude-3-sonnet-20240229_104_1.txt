{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Mating with respect to dreaming is completely random

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
