{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (do not remember dreaming).
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (do remember dreaming at least occasionally).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
