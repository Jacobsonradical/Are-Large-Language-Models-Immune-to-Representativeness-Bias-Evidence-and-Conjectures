{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The population is divided into Dreamers (80%) and Nondreamers (20%).
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
