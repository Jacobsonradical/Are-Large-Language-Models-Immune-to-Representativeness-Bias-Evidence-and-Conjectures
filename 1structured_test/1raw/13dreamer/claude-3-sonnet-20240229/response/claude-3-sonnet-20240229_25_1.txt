{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.
- We are given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
