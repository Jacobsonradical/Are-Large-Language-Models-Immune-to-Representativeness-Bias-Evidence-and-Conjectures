To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (dream at least occasionally).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (do not remember ever dreaming).
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer, as mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
