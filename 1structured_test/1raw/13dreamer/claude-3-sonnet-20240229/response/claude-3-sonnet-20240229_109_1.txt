{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the problem statement.

According to the problem, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of people who are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 or 20%.
