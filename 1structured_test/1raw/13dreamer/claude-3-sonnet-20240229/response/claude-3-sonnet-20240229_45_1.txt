{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2, the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.
