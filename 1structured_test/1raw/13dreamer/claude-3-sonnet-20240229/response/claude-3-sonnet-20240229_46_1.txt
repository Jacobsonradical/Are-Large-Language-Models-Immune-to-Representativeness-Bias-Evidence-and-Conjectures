{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status
- The probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%
