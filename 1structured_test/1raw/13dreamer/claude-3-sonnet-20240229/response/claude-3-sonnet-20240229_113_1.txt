To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers (0.8 probability).
- 20% of people are Nondreamers (0.2 probability).
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
