To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer = 0.2 (or 20%)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
