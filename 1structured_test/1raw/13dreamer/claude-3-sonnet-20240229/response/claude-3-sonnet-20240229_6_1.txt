To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's denote the event "Brett's wife is a Nondreamer" as A.

The probability of A is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Therefore, the probability of A is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
