{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" according to the given information.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
- This is because the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is independent of their partner's dreaming status, given the random mating condition.
