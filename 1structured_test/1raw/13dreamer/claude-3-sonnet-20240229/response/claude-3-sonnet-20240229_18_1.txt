To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's denote the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as A.

According to the information provided, the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Since mating is completely random, the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
