{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
