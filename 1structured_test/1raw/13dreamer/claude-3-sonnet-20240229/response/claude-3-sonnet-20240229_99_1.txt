{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
