{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream)
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they do not dream)
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
