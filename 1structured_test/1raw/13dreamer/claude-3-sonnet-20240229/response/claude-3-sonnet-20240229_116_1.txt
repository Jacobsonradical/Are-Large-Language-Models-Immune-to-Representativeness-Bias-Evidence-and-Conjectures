To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A = Brett is a Nondreamer
B = Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the provided information, we know that P(A) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).
Since mating is completely random, the events A and B are independent.

For independent events, P(B|A) = P(B).

P(B) = P(Brett's wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B) = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
