To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A = Brett is a Nondreamer
B = Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the events A and B are independent.
Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B)

P(B) = Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.2 (given information)

{probability: 0.2}
