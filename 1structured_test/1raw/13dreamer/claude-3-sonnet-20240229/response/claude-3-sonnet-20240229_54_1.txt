{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- There are two possible categories for dreaming: Dreamers and Nondreamers.
- According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
- This is because the mating (or pairing) between Dreamers and Nondreamers is completely random, so the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
