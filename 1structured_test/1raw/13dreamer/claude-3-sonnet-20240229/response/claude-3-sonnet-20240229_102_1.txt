To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
