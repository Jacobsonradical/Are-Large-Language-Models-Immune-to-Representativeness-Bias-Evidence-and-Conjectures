{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people (or 0.8) are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people (or 0.2) are "Nondreamers"
- Brett is a Nondreamer

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
