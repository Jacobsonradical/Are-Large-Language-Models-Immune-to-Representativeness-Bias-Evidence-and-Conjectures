{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and 80% as "Dreamers".
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
