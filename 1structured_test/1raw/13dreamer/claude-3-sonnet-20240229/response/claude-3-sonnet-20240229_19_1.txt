To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers (0.8 probability of being a Dreamer).
- 20% of people are Nondreamers (0.2 probability of being a Nondreamer).
- Brett is a Nondreamer.
- Mating is completely random, meaning the dreaming status of Brett's wife is independent of Brett's status.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
