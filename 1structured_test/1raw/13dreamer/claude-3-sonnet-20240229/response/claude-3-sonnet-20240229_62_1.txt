To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

Let's denote the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as A.

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability of event A is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
