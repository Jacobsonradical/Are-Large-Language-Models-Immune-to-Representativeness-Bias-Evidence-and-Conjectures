To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett is a Nondreamer
B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random, the events A and B are independent. Therefore, we can use the multiplication rule:

P(B|A) = P(B)

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, P(B), is equal to 0.2 (20%).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is:

{probability: 0.2}
