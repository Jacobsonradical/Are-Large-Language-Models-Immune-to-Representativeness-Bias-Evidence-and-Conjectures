{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that any given individual (in this case, Brett's wife) is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%. As mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
