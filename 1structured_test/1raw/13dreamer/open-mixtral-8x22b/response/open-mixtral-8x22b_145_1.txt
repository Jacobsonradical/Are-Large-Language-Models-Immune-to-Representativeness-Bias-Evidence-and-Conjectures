{probability: 0.20}

Given that the population is divided into 80% Dreamers and 20% Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20. This is assuming that mating is completely random and the characteristics of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer are independent of each other.
