{probability: 0.2}

Given that the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers is 80% and 20% respectively, and mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%. This is because the probability of any person being a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of their relationship to Brett.
