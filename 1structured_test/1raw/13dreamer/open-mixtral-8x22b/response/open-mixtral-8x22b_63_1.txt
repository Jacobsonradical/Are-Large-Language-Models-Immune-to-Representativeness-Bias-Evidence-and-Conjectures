{probability: 0.20}

Given that the population is evenly divided between Dreamers and Nondreamers, and assuming mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%. This is because the classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent of their relationships or mating.
