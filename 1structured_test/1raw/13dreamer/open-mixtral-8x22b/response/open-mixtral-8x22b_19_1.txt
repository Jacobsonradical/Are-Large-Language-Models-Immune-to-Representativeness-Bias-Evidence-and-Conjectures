{probability: 0.2, Please note that this is based on the assumption that the population consists of 80% Dreamers and 20% Nondreamers, and mating is completely random. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.}
