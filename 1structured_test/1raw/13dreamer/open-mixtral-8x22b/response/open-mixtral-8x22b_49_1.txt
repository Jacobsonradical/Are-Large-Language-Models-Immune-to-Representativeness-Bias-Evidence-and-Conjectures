{probability: 0.2,
The problem assumes that the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers is uniform, with 80% being dreamers and 20% being nondreamers. Since mating is said to be completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.}
