{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the percentage of Nondreamers in the population. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
