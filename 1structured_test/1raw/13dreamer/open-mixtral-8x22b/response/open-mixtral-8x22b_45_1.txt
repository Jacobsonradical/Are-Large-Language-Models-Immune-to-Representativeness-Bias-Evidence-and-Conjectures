{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population of Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability is 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
