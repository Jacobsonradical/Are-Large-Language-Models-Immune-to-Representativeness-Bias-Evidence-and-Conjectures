{probability: 0.2}

Since the population is divided into 80% Dreamers and 20% Nondreamers, and mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%). This is because each individual's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification.
