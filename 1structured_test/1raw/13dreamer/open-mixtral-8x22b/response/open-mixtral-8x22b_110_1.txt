{probability: 0.2}

Since dreaming and non-dreaming are considered as random mating, the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. Assuming Brett's wife was randomly chosen, the probability that she is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population, which is 0.2.
