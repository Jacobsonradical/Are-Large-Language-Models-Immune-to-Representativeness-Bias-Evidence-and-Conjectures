{probability: 0.20}

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be 0.20 or 20%. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, we can directly use the given percentage to find the probability.
