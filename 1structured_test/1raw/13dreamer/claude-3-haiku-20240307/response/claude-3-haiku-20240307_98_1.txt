To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the proportion of dreamers and nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.04

And the probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
P(B|A) = 0.04 / 0.2 = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
