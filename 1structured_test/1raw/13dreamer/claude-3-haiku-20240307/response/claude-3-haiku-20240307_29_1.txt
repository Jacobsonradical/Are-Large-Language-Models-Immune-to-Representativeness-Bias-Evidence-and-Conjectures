To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers," and 20% are "Nondreamers."
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The formula for conditional probability is:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

In this case, we want to find P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer).

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
                                                 = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
