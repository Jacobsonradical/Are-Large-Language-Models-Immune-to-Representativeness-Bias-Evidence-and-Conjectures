To solve this problem, we can use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (given)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (0.20 × 0.20) / 0.20 = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
