To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people (both sexes) report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

Let A be the event that Brett is a Nondreamer, and B be the event that his wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

We know that P(A) = 0.20, as 20% of people are Nondreamers.

To find P(A and B), we need to consider the probability of two Nondreamers mating, which is random.

P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
