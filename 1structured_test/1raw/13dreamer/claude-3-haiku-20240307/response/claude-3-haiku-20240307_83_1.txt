To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the multiplication rule for independent events.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that she is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
