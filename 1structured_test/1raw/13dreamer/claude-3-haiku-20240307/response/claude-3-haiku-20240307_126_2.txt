To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of two Nondreamers mating is the probability of a Nondreamer selecting another Nondreamer, which is:

{probability: 0.2 Ã— 0.2 = 0.04}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%.
