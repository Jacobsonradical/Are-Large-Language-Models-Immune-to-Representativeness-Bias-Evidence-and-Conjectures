To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20%.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
