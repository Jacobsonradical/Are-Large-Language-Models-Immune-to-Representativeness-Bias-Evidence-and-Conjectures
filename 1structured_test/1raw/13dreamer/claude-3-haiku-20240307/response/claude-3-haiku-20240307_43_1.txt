To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each partner being a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04, or 4%.
