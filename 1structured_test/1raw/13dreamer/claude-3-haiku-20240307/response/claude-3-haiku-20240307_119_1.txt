To solve this problem, we can use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer
= 20%
= 0.20

Therefore, the answer can be expressed as:

{probability: 0.20}
