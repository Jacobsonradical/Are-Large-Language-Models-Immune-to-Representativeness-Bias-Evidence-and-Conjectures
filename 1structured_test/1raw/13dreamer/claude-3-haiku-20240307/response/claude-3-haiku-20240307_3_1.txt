To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of two Nondreamers mating is the probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer.

The probability of a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}

The probability is 0.04, which is 4%.
