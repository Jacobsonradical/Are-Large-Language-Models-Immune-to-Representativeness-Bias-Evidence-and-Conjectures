To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people (both sexes) are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that the husband is a Nondreamer.

The conditional probability can be calculated using the formula:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | husband is a Nondreamer) = P(both are Nondreamers) / P(husband is a Nondreamer)

P(both are Nondreamers) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04 (since the mating is completely random)
P(husband is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
