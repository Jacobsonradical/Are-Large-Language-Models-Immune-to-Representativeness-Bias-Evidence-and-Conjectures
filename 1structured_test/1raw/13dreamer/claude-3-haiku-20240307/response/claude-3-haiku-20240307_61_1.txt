To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
