To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer", we need to calculate the probability that both Brett and his wife are "Nondreamers".

The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the conditional probability of his wife being a "Nondreamer" given that Brett is a "Nondreamer".

This can be calculated using the formula:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(both are Nondreamers) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(both are Nondreamers) = P(Brett is a Nondreamer) × P(wife is a Nondreamer)
P(both are Nondreamers) = 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.04

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:
{probability: 0.2, a number between 0 and 1}
