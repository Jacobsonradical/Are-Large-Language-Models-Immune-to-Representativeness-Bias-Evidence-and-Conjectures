To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the concept of random mating with respect to dreaming.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated using the concept of independent events.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(Nondreamer)
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
