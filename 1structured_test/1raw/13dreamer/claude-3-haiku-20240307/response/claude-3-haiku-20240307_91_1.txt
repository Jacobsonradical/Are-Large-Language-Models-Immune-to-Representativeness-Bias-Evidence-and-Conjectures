To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following:

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer multiplied by the probability of a Nondreamer, which is:

{probability: 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%.
