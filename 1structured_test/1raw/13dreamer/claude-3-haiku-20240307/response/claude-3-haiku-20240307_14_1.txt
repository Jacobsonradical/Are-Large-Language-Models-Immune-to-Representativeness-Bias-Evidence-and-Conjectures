To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since mating is completely random, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities:
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.04}
