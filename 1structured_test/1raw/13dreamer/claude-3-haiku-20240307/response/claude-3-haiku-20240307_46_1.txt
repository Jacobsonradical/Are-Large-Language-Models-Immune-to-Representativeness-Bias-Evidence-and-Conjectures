To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability of his wife being a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.
