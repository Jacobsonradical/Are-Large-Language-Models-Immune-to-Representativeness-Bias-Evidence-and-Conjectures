To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream at least occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer given that one person in the couple is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
