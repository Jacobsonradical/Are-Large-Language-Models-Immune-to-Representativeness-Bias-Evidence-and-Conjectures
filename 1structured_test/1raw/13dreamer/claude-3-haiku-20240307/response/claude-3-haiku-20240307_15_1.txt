To solve this problem, we can use the principles of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, even occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probabilities remain the same as in the general population.
