To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
P(A) = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04 (since mating is completely random)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
