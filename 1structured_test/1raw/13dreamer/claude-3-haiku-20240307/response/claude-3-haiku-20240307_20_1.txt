To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

If Brett is a Nondreamer, then the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
