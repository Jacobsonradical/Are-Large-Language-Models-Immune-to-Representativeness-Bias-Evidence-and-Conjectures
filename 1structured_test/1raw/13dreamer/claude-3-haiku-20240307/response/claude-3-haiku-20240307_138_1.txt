To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that the husband is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the following events:
- H: Husband is a Nondreamer
- W: Wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(W|H), the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer given that the husband is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(W|H) = P(H and W) / P(H)

P(H) = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(H and W) = P(H) × P(W|H) = 0.20 × P(W|H) (since mating is completely random)

Solving for P(W|H):
P(W|H) = P(H and W) / P(H)
P(W|H) = (0.20 × P(W|H)) / 0.20
P(W|H) = P(W|H)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
