To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the principles of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
