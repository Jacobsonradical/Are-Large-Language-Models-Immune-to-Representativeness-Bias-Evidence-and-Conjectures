To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, either occasionally or regularly.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

We can assume that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's dreaming status. Therefore, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities of being Nondreamers:

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) Ã— P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

We know that P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

To find P(wife is a Nondreamer), we can use the same probability, since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20, a number between 0 and 1}
