To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
