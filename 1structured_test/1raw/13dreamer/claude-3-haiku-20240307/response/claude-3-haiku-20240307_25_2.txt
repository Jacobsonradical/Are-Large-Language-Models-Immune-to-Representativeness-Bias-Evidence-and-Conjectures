To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
A: Brett is a Nondreamer
B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the law of conditional probability, we have:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04

And the probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A) = 0.04 / 0.2 = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
