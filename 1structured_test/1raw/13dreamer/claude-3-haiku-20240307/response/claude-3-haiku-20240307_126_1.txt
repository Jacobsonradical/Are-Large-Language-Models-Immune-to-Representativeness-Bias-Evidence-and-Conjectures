To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer

Using the principles of conditional probability, we can express this as:

{probability: 0.2, explanation: Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.}
