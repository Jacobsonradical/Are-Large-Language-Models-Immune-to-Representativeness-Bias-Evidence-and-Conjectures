To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the prevalence of dreaming and the assumption of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

Assuming random mating, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities of being Nondreamers.

{probability: 0.04}

The calculation is as follows:
Probability that Brett is a Nondreamer = 0.20 (20%)
Probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer = 0.20 (20%)
Probability that both are Nondreamers = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04 (4%)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%.
