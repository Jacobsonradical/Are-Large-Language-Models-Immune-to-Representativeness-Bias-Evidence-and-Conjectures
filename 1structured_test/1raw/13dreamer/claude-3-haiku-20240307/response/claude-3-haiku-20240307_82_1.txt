To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the conditional probability of her being a "Nondreamer" given that Brett is a "Nondreamer".

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

We know that P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20, as 20% of people are "Nondreamers".

To find P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer), we can use the fact that mating is completely random. This means that the probability of both Brett and his wife being "Nondreamers" is the product of their individual probabilities of being "Nondreamers".

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:
{probability: 0.20}
