To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"
- Mating is completely random

The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the probability that she belongs to the 20% of the population that are "Nondreamers".

{probability: 0.2}
