To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people, both males and females, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the following events:
A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the conditional probability formula, we have:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

P(A) = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = 0.20 × P(B|A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is also 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
