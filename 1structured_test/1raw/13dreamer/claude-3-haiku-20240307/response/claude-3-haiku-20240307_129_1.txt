To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conditional probability and the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability of the wife being a Nondreamer can be calculated using the following formula:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
                                                  = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
