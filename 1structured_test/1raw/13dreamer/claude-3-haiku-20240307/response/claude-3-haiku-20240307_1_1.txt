To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the information provided about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
