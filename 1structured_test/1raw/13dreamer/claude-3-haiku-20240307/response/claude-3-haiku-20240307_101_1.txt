Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%, since Nondreamers make up 20% of the population.
