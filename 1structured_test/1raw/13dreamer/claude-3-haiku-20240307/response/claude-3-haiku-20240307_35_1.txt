To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability P(B|A), which is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the law of conditional probability, we have:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
