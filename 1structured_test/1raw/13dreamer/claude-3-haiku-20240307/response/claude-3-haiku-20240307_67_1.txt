To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" = Probability that a randomly selected person is a "Nondreamer"
= 20% or 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
