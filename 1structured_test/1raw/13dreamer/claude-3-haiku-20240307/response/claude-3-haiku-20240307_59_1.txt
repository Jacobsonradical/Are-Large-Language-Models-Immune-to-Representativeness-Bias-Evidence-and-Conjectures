To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

Let's denote the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as P(wife is a Nondreamer).

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
