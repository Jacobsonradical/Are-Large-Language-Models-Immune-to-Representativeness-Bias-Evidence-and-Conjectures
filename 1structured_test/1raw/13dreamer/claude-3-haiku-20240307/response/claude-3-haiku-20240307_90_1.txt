To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating, which is the probability of a Nondreamer being selected as a spouse.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
