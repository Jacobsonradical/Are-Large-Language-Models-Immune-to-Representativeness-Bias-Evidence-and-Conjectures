To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.
