To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two independent events occurring together:
- The probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).
- The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the product of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.20}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
