To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that two Nondreamers are paired.

The probability of a Nondreamer being paired with another Nondreamer is the product of the probabilities of each partner being a Nondreamer.

Probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
