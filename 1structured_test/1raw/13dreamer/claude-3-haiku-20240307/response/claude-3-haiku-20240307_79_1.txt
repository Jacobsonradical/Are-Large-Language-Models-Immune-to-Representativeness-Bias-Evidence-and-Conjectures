To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

We can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) * P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
