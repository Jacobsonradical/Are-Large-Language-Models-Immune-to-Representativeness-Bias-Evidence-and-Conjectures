To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(B|A) = (P(A|B) * P(B)) / P(A)

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.20 (the proportion of Nondreamers)
- P(B) = 0.20 (the proportion of Nondreamers)
- P(A|B) = 1 (given that Brett is a Nondreamer, his wife has a 100% chance of also being a Nondreamer)

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B|A) = (1 * 0.20) / 0.20 = 1

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 1}
