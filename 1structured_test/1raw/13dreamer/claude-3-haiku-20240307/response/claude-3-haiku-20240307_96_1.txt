To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is simply the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
