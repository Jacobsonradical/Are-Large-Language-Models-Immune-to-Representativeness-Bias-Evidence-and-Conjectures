To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), which is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(A) = 0.20 (probability that a person is a Nondreamer)
P(B) = 0.20 (probability that a person is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
