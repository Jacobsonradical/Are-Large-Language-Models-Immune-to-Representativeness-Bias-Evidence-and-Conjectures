To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
