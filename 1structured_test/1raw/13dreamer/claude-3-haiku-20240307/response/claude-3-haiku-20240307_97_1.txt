To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating with respect to dreaming is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the concept of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that she is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

We can use the formula:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04 (since the mating is completely random)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Substituting the values, we get:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.04 / 0.20 = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
