To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: your answer, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.2, as the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
