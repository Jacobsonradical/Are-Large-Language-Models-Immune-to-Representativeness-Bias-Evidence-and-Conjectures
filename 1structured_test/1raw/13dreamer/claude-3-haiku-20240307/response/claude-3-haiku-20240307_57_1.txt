To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the population distribution of dreamers and nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
