To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
