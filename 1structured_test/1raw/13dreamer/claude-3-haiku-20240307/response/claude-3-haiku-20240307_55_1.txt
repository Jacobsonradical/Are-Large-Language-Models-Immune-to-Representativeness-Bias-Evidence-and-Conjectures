To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that two Nondreamers are paired together.

The probability of a Nondreamer being paired with another Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer being selected multiplied by the probability of another Nondreamer being selected.

Probability of a Nondreamer being selected = 0.20 (20% of the population)
Probability of another Nondreamer being selected = 0.20 (20% of the population)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
