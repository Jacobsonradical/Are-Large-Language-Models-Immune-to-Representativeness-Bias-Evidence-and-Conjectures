To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the problem, 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
