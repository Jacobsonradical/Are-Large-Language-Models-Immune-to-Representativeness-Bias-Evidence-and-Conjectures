To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that she is randomly selected from the 20% of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.20}
