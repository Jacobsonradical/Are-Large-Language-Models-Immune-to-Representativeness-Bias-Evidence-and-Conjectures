To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of a Nondreamer marrying another Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
