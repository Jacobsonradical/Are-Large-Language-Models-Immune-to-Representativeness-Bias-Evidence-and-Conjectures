To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"
- Mating is completely random

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers being selected randomly.

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer as Brett's wife, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer twice, which can be calculated using the multiplication rule for independent events.

{probability: 0.04}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04, or 4%.
