To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conditional probability and the provided information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the principles of conditional probability, we can calculate the desired probability as follows:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.20 (the proportion of Nondreamers in the population).

To find P(A and B), we can use the assumption of random mating, which means that the probability of a Nondreamer marrying a Nondreamer is the product of the proportions of Nondreamers in the population.

P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
