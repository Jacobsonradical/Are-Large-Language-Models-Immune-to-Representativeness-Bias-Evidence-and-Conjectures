To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the following events:
A: Brett is a Nondreamer
B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the rules of conditional probability, we can write:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We know that:
P(A) = 0.20 (the proportion of Nondreamers)
P(B) = 0.20 (the proportion of Nondreamers)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population:
P(B|A) = P(B) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
