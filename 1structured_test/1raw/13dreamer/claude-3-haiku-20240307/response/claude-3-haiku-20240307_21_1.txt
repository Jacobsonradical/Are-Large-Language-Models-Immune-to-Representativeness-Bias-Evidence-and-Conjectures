To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is a Nondreamer.

The probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
