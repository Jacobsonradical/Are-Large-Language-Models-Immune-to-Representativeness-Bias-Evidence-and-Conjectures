To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principles of probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers being paired together.

The probability of a Nondreamer being paired with a Nondreamer can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each partner being a Nondreamer.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
