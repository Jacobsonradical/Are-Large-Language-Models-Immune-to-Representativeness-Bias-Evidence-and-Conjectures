To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer multiplied by the probability of a Nondreamer, which is:

{probability: 0.04}

Explanation:
- The probability of a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.
- The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%.
