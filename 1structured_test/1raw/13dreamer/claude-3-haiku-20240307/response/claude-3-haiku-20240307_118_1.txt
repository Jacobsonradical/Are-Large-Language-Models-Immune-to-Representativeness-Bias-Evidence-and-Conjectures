To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
