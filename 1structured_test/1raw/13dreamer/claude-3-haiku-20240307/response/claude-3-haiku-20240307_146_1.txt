To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim that they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
