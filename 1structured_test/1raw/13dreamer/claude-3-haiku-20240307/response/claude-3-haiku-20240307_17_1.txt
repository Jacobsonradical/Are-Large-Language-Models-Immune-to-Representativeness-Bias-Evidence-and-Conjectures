To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of two Nondreamers mating is the product of the probabilities of each partner being a Nondreamer.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
