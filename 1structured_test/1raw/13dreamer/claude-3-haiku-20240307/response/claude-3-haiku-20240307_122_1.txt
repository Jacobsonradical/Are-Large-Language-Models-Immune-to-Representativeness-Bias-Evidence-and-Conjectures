To solve this problem, we need to use the concepts of conditional probability and the law of total probability.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the law of total probability, we can express the probability as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.
- P(A) is the probability that a person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 (20%).
- P(B|A') is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Dreamer.
- P(A') is the probability that a person is a Dreamer, which is 0.80 (80%).

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is equal to the probability that a person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Similarly, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Dreamer, is also 0.20.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.20 * 0.20 + 0.20 * 0.80
P(B) = 0.04 + 0.16
P(B) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
