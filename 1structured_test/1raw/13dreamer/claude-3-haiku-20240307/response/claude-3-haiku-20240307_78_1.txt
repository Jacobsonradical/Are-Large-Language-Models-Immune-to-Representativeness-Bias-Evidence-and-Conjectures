To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer = 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
