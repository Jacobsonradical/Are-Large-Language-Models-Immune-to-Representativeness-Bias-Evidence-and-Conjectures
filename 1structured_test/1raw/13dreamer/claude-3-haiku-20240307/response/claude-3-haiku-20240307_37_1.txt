To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that she is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2 Ã— 0.2 = 0.04 (since the events are independent)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
