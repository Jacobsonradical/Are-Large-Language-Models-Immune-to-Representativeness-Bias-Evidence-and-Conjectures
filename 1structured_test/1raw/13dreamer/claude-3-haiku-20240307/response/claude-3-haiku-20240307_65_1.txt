To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We are given that P(B) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

To find P(A), we need to use the formula for conditional probability:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
