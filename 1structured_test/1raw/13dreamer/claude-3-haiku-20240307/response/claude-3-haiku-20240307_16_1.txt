To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(both are Nondreamers) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(both are Nondreamers) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04 (since mating is random)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
