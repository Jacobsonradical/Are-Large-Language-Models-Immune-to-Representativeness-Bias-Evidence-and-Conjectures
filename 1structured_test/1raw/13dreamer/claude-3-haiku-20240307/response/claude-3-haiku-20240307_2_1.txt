To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(both are Nondreamers) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities:

P(both are Nondreamers) = 0.2 Ã— 0.2 = 0.04

The probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
