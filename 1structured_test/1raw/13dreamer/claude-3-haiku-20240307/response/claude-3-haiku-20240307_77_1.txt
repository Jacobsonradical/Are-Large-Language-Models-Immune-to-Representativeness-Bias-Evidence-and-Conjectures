To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the principle of random mating, which means that the choice of a partner is not influenced by the partner's dreaming status.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

Since the mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20 (20%).

{probability: 0.20}
