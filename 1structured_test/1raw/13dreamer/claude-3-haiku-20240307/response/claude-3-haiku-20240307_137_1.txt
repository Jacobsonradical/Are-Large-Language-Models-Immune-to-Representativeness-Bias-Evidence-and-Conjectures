To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the concept of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, can be represented as:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
