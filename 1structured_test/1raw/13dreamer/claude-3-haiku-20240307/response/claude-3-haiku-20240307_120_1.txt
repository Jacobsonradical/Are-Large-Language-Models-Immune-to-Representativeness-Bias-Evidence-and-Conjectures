To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, and since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
