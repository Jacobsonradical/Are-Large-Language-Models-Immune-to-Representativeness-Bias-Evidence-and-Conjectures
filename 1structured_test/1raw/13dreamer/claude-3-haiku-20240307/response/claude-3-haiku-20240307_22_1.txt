To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report dreaming, while 20% do not remember ever dreaming.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that she is part of the 20% of the population that does not remember dreaming.

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of two Nondreamers mating is the product of the individual probabilities of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 Ã— 0.2 = 0.04.
