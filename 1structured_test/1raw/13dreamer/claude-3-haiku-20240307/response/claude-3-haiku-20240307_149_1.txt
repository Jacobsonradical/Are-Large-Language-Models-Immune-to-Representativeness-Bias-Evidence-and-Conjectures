To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is equal to the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

P(B|A) = P(B) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
