To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
                                                 = 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.04

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
