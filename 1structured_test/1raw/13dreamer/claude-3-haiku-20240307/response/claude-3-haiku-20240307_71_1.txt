To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (P(Brett is a Nondreamer | wife is a Nondreamer) * P(wife is a Nondreamer)) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (given)
P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (since mating is random)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer | wife is a Nondreamer) = 1 (since if Brett is a Nondreamer, his wife must also be a Nondreamer)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (1 * 0.20) / 0.20 = 1

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 1}
