To solve this problem, we can use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population is 20% or 0.2.
