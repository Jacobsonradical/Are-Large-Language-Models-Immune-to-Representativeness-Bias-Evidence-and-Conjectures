To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people (both sexes) are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.2, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
