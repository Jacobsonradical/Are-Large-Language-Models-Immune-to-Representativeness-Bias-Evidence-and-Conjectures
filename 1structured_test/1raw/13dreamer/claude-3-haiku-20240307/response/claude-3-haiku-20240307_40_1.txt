To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
