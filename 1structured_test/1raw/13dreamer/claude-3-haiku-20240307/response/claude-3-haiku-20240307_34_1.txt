To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
