To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population.

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
