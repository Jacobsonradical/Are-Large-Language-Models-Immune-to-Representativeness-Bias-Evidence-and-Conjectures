To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of two Nondreamers mating is the probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer mating multiplied by the probability of another Nondreamer mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating is 0.20 (20% of the population).
The probability of another Nondreamer mating is also 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
