To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"
- Mating is completely random

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
