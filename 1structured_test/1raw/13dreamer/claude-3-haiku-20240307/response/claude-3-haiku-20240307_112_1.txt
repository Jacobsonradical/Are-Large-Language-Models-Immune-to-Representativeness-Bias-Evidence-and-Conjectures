To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the following logic:

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
