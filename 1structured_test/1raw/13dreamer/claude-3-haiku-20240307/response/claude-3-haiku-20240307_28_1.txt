To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and the concept of random mating.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that a random person is a Nondreamer
= 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
