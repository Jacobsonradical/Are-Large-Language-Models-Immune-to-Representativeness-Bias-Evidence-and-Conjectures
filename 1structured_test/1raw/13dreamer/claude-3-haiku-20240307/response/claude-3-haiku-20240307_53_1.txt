To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with a Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer multiplied by the probability of a Nondreamer, which is:

{probability: 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%.
