To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principle of random mating, which states that the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is independent of their partner's dreaming status.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%), regardless of their partner's dreaming status.
