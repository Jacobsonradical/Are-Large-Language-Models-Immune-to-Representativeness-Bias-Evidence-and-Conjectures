To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated using the conditional probability formula:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (given)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (0.20 × 0.20) / 0.20 = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
