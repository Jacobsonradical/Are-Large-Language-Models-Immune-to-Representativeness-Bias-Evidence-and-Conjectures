To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
