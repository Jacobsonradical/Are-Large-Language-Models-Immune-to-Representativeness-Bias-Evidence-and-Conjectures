To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". This means that the probability of a person being a "Nondreamer" is 0.20 or 20%.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a "Nondreamer", which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
