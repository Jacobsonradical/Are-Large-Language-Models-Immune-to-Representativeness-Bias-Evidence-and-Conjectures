To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
