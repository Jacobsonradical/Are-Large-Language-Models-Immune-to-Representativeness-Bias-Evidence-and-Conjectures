To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the given information, the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
