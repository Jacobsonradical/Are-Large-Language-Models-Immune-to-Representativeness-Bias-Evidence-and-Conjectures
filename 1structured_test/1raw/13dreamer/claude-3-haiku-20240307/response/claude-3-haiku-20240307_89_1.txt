To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that she belongs to the 20% Nondreamer population.

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
