To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to apply the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
