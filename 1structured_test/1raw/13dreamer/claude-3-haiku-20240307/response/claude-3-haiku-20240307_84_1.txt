To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer
= 0.20 (or 20%)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
