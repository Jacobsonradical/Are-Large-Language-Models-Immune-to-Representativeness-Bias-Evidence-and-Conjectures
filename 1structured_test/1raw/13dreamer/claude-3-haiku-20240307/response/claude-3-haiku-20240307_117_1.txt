To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
