To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people (both sexes) report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim that they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
