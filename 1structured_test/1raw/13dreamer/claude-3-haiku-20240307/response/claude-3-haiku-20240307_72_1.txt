To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of the individual probabilities:

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04

The probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
