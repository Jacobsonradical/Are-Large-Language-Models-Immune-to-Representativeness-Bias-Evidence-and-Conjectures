To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principle of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
