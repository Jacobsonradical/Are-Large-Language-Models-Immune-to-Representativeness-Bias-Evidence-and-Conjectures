To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
