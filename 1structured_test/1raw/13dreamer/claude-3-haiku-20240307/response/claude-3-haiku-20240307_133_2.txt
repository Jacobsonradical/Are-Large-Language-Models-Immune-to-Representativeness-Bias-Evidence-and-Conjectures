To solve this problem, we can use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
