To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated using the principles of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Using the Bayes' theorem, we can express this as:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (P(Brett is a Nondreamer | wife is a Nondreamer) * P(wife is a Nondreamer)) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Where:
- P(Brett is a Nondreamer | wife is a Nondreamer) = 1 (since if Brett is a Nondreamer, his wife being a Nondreamer is certain)
- P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (since 20% of the population are Nondreamers)
- P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 (since 20% of the population are Nondreamers)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (1 * 0.20) / 0.20 = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
