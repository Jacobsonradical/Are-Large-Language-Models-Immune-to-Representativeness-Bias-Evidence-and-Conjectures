To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(both are Nondreamers) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

P(both are Nondreamers) = P(Brett is a Nondreamer) Ã— P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is equal to the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
