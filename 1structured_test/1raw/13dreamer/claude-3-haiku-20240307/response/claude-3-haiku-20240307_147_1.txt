To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer).

Using the given information, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of the individual probabilities:

P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04

And the probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
