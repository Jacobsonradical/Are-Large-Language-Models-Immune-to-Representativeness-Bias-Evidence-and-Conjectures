To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

The probability that a person is a "Nondreamer" is 20% or 0.20.

Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is also 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
