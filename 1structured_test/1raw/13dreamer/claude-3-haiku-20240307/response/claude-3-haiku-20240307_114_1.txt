To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the conditional probability formula:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
