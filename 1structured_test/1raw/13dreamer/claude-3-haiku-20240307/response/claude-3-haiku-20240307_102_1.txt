To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principles of probability theory.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers mating.

The probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is the product of the probabilities of each individual being a Nondreamer.

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = {probability: 0.20}
