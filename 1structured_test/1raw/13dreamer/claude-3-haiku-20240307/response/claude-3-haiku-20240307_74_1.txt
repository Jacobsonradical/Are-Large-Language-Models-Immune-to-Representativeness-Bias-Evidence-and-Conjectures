To solve this problem, we can use the principles of conditional probability and the given information.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

The reasoning is that since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
