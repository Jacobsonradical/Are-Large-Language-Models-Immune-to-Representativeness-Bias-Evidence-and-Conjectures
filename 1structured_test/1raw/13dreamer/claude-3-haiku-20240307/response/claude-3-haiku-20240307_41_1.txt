To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities of being Nondreamers:
P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

And the probability that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
