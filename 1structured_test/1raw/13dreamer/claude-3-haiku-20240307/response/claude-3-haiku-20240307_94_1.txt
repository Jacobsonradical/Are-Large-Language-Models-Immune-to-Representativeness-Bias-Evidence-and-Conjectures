To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated using the principle of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
