To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Assuming that mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
