To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
