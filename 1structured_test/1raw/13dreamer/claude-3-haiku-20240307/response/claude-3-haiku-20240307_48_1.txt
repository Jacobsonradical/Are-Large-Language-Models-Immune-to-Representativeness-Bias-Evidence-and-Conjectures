To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
