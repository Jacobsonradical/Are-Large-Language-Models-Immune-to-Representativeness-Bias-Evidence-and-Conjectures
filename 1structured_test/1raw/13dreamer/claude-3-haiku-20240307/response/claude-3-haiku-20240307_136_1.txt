To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"
- Mating is completely random

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because mating is completely random, and the probability of a Nondreamer being paired with another Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
