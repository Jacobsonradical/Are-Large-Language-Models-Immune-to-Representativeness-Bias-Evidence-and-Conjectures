To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people, irrespective of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that she is a Nondreamer, given that her husband is a Nondreamer.

Using the rule of conditional probability, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(wife is a Nondreamer | husband is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and husband is a Nondreamer) / P(husband is a Nondreamer)

P(wife is a Nondreamer and husband is a Nondreamer) = 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04 (since mating is random)
P(husband is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
