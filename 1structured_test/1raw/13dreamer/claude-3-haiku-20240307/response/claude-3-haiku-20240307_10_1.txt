To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the probability of both partners being Nondreamers.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer being selected from the population.

The probability of a Nondreamer = 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
