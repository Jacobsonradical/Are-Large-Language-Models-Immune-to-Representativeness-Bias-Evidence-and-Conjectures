To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer.
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability: P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
P(A) = 0.2 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers)
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A) = 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.04 (since mating is random with respect to dreaming)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
