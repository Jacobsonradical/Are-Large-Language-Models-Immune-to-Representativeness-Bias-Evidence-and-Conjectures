To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
