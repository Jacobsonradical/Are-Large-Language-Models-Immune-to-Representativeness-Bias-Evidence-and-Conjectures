To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
