To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principles of probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
