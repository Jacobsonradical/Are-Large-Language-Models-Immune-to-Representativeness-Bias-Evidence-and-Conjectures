To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Using the given information, we can calculate this probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
