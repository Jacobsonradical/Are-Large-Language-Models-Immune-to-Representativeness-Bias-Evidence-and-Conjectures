To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of probability and the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
