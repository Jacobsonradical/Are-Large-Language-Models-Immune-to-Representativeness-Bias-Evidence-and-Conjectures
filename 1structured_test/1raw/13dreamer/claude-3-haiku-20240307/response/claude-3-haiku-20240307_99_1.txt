To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, which means that the probability of a Dreamer mating with a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a Nondreamer mating with a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is 0.20 (20% of the population).
