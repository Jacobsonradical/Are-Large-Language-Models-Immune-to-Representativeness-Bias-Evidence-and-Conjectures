To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the concept of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Probability = {probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
