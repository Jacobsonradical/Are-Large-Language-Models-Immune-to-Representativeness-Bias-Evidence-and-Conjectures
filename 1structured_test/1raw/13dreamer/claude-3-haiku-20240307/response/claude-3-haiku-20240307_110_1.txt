To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" = Probability that a randomly selected person is a "Nondreamer"
                                                 = 0.20 (or 20%)

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.20}
