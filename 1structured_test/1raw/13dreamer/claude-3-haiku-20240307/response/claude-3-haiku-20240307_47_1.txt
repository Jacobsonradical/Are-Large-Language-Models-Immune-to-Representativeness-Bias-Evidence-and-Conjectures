To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the principles of Mendelian genetics and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- If mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
