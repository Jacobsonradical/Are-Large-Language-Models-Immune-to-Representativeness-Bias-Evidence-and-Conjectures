Given that mating is completely random and the percentage of people who are Nondreamers is 20%, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the entire population that are Nondreamers.

{probability: 0.2}
