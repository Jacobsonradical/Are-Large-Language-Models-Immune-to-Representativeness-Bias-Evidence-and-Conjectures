Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer, and knowing that dreaming status does not affect mating choice (mating is random with respect to dreaming), the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer should simply reflect the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%.

Thus, the required probability in decimal form is:
{probability: 0.2}
