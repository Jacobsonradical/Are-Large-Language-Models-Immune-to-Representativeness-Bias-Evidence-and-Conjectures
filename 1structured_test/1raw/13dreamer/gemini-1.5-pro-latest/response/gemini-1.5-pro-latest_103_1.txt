{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not Brett is a dreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a dreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the population average, which is 0.2 or 20%.
