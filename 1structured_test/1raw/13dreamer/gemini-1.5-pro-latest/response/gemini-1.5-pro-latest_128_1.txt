{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no bearing on their partner choice. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife also being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population frequency: 20%, or 0.2.
