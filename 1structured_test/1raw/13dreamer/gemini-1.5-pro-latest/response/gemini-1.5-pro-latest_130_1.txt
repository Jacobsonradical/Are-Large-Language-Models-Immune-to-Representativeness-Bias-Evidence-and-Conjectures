{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 0.2 or 20%.
