{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no bearing on the dream status of his wife.  Here's why:

* **Mating is random:** The prompt states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means people don't choose partners based on whether or not they dream.
* **Independent probability:** The probability of someone being a Nondreamer (20%) is independent of their partner's dream status. 

Therefore, the chance of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the chance of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
