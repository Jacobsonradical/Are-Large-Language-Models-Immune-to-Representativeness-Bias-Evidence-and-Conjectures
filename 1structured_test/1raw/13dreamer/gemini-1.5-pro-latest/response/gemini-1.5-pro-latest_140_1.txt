{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The key here is the phrase "mating is completely random." This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are considered "Nondreamers," the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%, or 0.2.
