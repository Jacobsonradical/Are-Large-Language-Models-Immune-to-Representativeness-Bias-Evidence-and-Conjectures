{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The key here is that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%, or 0.2.
