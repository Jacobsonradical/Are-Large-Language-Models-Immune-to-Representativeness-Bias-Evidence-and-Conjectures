{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's dreamer/nondreamer status has no bearing on the likelihood of their partner being a dreamer or nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of his own status.
