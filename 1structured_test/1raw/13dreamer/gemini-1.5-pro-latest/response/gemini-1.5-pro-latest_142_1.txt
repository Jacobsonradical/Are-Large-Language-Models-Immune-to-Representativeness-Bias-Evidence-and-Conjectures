{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the population frequency of Nondreamers.
