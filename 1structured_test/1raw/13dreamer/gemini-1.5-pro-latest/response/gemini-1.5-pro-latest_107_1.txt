{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The question states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's dreamer/nondreamer status has no influence on the type of person they marry.
* **Population Distribution:** The overall population has a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer. Since mating is random, Brett's wife is essentially a random selection from the population.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population prevalence of Nondreamers, which is **20% or 0.2**.
