{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on their partner's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average: **20% or 0.2**.
