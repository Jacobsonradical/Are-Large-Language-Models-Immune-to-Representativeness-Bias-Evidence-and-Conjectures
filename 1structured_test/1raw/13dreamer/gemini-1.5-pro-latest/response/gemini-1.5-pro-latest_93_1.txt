{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population prevalence of Nondreamers.  

The information about Brett's dream status is irrelevant in this case.  We are told that 20% of the population are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, there is a 20% probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
