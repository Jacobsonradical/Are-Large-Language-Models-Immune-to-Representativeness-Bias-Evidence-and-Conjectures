{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that mating is completely random regarding dreaming. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%, or 0.2.
