{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population. 

The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers". 

Therefore, there is a 20% chance (or 0.2 probability) that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
