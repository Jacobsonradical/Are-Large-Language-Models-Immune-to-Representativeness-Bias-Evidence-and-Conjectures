{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random concerning dreaming. This means that a person's dreamer/nondreamer status does not influence their choice of partner.
* **Population Distribution:** The overall population has a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer. 
* **Independent Events:** Brett's status as a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability distribution within the general population. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
