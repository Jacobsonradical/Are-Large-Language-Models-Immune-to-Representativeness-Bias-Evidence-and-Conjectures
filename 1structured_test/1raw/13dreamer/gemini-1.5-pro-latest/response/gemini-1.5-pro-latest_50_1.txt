{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The statement mentions that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their partner's dream status. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average, which is 20% or 0.2.
