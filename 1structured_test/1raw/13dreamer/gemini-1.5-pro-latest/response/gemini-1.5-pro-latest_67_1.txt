{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no influence on their partner choice. 

Since 20% of the population are "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 20% or 0.2.
