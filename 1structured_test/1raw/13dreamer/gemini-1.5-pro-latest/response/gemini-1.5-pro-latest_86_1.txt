{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is random concerning dreaming. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
* **Population Distribution:** The given information tells us 20% of the general population are Nondreamers. 
* **Independent Events:** Since mating is random, Brett's wife's dream status is independent of his.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
