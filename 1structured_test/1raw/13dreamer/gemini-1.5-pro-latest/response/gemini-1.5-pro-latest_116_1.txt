{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random regarding dreaming. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.
* **Population Distribution:** The given information tells us that 20% of the general population are considered "Nondreamers." 
* **Independent Probability:** Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
