{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.  Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The question states that mating is completely random regarding dreaming. This means there's no connection between someone's dreamer status and their partner's dreamer status.
* **Population Prevalence:** The overall probability of anyone being a Nondreamer is 20% (as given in the problem). 

Since mating is random, Brett finding a wife who is a Nondreamer is the same probability as anyone else finding a Nondreamer partner â€“ a 20% chance.
