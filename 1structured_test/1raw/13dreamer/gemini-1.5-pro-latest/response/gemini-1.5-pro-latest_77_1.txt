{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The key here is **"mating is completely random"**. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency: 20%, or 0.2.
