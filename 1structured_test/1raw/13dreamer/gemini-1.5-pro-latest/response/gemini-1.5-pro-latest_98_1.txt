{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%, or 0.2.
