{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer in the population is 20%, so the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer remains at 20%, or 0.2.
