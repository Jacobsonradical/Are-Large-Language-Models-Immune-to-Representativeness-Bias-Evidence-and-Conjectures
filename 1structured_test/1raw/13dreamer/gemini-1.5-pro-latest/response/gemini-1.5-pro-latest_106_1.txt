{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The prompt states that mating is completely random concerning dreaming. This means there's no connection between an individual's dream recall and their partner's dream recall.
* **Population Distribution:** The given statistic (20% Nondreamers) applies to the general population.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
