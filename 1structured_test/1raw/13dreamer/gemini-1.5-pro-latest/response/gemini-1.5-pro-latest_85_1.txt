{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%.
