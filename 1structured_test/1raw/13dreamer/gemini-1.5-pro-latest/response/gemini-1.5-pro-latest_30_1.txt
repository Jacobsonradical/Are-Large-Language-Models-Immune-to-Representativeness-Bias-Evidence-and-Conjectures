{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:**  The question states that mating is completely random concerning dreaming. This means there's no connection between an individual's dreaming tendency and their partner's.
* **Population Distribution:** The given statistics tell us that 20% of the general population are Nondreamers. Since mating is random, Brett choosing a wife is like randomly selecting a person from the population. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
