{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the dream classification of his wife. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random concerning dreaming. This means a Nondreamer finding a partner is not influenced by whether the potential partner is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
* **Independent Events:**  The dream classification of Brett and his wife are independent events. One doesn't depend on the other.
* **Population Distribution:** Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's status.
