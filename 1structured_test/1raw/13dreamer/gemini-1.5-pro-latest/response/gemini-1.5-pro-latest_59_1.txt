{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population frequency of Nondreamers.  The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant in this case. We are told 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Therefore, there's a 20% chance his wife is also a Nondreamer.
