{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance his wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.
