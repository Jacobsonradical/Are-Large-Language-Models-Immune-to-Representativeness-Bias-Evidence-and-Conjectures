{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random regarding dreaming. This means there's no connection between one person's dream recall and their partner's dream recall. 
* **Population Distribution:** The overall population has 20% Nondreamers. Since mating is random, Brett choosing a wife is like randomly selecting a person from the population.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
