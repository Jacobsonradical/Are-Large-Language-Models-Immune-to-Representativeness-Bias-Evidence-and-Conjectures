{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random concerning dreaming. This means there's no connection or influence between an individual's dreamer status and their choice of partner.
* **Population Distribution:** The overall population has a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer. Since mating is random, Brett choosing a wife doesn't change this overall probability. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population frequency of Nondreamers, which is **20% or 0.2**.
