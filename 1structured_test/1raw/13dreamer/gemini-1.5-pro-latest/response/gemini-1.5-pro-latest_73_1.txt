{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on the likelihood of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", there is a 20% chance his wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's status.
