{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The statement indicates that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no bearing on their partner choice. 

Since 20% of the general population are "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the population average, which is 20% or 0.2.
