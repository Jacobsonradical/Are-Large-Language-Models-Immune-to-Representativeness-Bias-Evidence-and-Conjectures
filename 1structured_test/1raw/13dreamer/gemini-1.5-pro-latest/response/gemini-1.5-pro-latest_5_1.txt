{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is or is not a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means people don't choose partners based on whether or not they remember dreaming.
* **Independent Events:** Whether Brett remembers his dreams or not is independent of whether his wife remembers hers.  

Since the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
