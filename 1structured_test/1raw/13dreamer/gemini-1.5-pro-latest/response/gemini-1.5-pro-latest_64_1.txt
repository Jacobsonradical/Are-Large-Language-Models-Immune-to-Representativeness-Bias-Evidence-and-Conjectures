{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming.  This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no bearing on their partner selection.

Since 20% of the general population are "Nondreamers", there is a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of his own dream status.
