{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on the dream classification of their partner. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency of Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
