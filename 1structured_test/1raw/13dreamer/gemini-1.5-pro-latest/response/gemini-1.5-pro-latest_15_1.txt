{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population.  This is stated as 20% in the problem. 

Therefore, there is a 20% chance his wife is also a Nondreamer, represented as a probability of 0.2.
