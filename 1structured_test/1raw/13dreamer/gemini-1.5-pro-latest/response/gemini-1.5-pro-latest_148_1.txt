{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer doesn't influence their partner's likelihood. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of his own dream status.
