{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population.  We're told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, there is a 20% chance, or a probability of 0.2, that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
