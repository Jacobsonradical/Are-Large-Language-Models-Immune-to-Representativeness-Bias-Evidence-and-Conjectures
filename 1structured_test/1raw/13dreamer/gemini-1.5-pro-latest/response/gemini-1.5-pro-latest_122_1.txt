{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The key here is that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average: 20%, or 0.2.
