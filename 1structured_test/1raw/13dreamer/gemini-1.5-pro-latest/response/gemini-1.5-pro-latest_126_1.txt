{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their partner's dream status. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
