{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on the dreaming status of their partner. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population prevalence: 20%, or 0.2.
