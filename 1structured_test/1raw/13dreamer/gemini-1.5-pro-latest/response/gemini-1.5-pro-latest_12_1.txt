{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The key here is the phrase "mating is completely random."  This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 20% or 0.2.
