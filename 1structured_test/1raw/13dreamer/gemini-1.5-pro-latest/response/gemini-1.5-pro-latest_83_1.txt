{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random, Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. The probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population, which is **20% or 0.2**.
