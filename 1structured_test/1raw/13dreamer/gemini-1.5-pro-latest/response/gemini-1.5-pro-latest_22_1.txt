{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no influence on their partner's likelihood of being one or the other.  

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of his own dreaming status.
