**Explanation:**

The problem states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no bearing on their partner choice. 

Since 20% of the general population are "Nondreamers", there is a 20% chance that Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of his own dream status.
