{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no influence on their partner's likelihood of being one or the other. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife also being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same: 20%.
