{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population.  The information about Brett's dream status is irrelevant in this case. 
 
The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
