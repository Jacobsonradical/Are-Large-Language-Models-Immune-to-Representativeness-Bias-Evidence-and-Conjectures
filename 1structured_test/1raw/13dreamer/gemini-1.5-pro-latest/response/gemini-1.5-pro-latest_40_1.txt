{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The statement "mating is completely random" means there's no connection between an individual's dreaming tendency and their choice of partner.
* **Population Prevalence:** The overall probability of anyone in the population being a Nondreamer is 20% (as stated in the problem). 

Therefore, since mating is random, Brett's wife has the same likelihood of being a Nondreamer as anyone else in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
