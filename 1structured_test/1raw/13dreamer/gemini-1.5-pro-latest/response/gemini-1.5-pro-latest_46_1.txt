{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not Brett is a dreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a dreamer or not. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply **20%, or 0.2**.
