{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The information about Brett being a Nondreamer is irrelevant to the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.  Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on the likelihood of their partner being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
* **Population Distribution:** The background rate of Nondreamers in the population is 20%. Since mating is random, Brett choosing a wife is like randomly selecting someone from the population.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the probability of anyone in the population being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
