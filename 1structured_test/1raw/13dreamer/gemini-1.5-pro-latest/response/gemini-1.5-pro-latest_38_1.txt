{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The question states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether or not someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no bearing on who they choose as a partner. 

Since 20% of the general population are "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife also being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 20% or 0.2.
