{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "mating is completely random" with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on the dreaming status of their partner.  

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of his own dreaming status.
