probability: 0.04

This is based on the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%. We then square this probability to find the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers, which is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04.
