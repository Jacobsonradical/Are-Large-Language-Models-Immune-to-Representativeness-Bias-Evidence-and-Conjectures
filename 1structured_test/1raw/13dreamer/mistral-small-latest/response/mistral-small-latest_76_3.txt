The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, assuming mating is completely random, is 0.2. This is because the probability of a Nondreamer mating with another Nondreamer is the product of their individual probabilities, which is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. However, since you asked for a probability between 0 and 1, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
