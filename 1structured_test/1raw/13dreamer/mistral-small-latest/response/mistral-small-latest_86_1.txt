The probabilities that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, assuming mating is completely random and the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is consistent across both sexes, is 0.2. This is because 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, so the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the percentage of Nondreamers in the population.
