{probability: 0.04, assuming mating is completely random and that 20% of people are Nondreamers}

The reasoning behind this is that if 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of selecting a Nondreamer at random, which is 0.20. Since mating is completely random, these probabilities are independent. Therefore, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04.
