{probability: 0.04, or 4%}

Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the product of their individual probabilities, assuming mating is completely random. So, 0.2 (Brett's probability of being a Nondreamer) multiplied by 0.2 (his wife's probability of being a Nondreamer) equals 0.04 or 4%.
