probability: 0.04

This is assuming that the probability of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent for each person, and that the percentages given apply. If 80% of people are "Dreamers", then 20% are "Nondreamers". The probability of both Brett and his wife being "Nondreamers" is therefore 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04.
