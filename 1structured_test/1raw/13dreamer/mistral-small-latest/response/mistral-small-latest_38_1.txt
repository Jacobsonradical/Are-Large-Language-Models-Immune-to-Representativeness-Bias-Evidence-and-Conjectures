Assuming that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer as the product of the probabilities of both events. If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer is 0.2. Similarly, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is also 0.2. Since mating is random, these events are independent, so we multiply the probabilities:

Probability = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04.
