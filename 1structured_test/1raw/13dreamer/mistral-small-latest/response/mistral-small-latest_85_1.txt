{probability: 0.04, assuming mating is completely random}

This is based on the assumption that the probability of a person being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is 80% and 20% respectively. If mating is completely random, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the product of their individual probabilities: 0.2 (Brett being a Nondreamer) * 0.2 (his wife being a Nondreamer) = 0.04.
