{probability: 0.04, assuming mating is completely random and the percentages of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population are consistent}

This assumes that the proportion of Nondreamers is 20% in the population, and since mating is completely random, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04.
