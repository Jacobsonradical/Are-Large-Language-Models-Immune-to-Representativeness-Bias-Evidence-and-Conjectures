probability: 0.04

Explanation:
Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (since mating is completely random). To find the probability of both Brett and his wife being Nondreamers, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04.
