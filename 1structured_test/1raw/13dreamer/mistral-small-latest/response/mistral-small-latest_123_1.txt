{probability: 0.04, assuming mating is completely random and the percentages of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population are as given}

Explanation:
Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%. Since mating is completely random, the probability that both Brett and his wife are Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.20 Ã— 0.20 = 0.04.
