The information provided does not suggest that mating is dependent on one's dreaming status. Therefore, we can assume that mating is independent of dreaming status. If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
