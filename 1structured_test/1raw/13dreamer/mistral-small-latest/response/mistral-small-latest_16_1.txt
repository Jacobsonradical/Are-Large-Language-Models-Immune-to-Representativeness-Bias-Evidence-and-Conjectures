probability: 0.04

The information given suggests that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20% as a decimal). However, since the question asks for the probability given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to consider the joint probability of both Brett and his wife being Nondreamers. Since mating is random, their statuses as Nondreamers are independent events. Therefore, we can multiply their individual probabilities: 0.20 (Brett being a Nondreamer) * 0.20 (his wife being a Nondreamer) = 0.04.
