probability: 0.04

This is based on the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. If Brett is a Nondreamer (20% of the population), then the probability that his partner is also a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.20). Therefore, the overall probability is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04 or 4%.
