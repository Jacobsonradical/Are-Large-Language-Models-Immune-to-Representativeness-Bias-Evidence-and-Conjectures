Given that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can assume that the wife's dreaming status is independent of Brett's. If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same, which is 0.2 or 20%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
