probability: 0.04

Explanation:
Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the product of the probabilities of Brett and his wife being Nondreamers. According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability is 0.2. Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.
