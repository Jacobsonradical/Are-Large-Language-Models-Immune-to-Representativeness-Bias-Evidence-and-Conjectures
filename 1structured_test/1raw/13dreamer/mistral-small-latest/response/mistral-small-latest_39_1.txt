{probability: 0.04, or 4%, assuming mating is completely random}

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of selecting a Nondreamer at random is 0.20. If Brett, as a Nondreamer, is selected at random, then the probability that his wife, also selected at random, is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (since mating is completely random). Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04, or 4%.
