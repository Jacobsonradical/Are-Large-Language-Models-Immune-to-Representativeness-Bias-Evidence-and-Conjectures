To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the random mating assumption. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
