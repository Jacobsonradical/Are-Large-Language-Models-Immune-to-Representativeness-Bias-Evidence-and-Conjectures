Given that Brett is a Nondreamer and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
