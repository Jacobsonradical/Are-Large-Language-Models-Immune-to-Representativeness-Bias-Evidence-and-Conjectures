To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability: } 0.20\} \]
