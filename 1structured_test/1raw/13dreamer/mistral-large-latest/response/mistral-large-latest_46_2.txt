Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of selecting a Nondreamer at random from the population.

Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.20\} \]
