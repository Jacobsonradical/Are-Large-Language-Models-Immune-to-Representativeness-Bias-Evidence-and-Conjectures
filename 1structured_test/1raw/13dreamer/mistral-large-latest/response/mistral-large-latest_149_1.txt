To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the general population statistics and the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.20}} \]
