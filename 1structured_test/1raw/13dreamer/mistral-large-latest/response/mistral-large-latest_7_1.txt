To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the random mating assumption. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\text{{probability: 0.20}}
\]
