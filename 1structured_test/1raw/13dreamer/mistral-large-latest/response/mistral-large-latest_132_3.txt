To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.20\} \]
