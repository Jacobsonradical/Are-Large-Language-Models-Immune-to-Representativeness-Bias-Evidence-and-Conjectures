Given that the population consists of 80% Dreamers and 20% Nondreamers, and assuming that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.20 \]

So the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.20\} \]
