To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can calculate the probability as follows:

1. The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
2. Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
