To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the random mating assumption and the given percentages of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Nondreamers}}{\text{Total population}} = 0.20 \]

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.20}} \]
