Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
