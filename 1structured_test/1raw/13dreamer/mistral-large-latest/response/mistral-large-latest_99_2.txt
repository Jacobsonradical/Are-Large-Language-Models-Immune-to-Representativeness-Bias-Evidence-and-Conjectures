To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following:

1. The probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
2. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

So, the probability is:

  "probability": 0.20
