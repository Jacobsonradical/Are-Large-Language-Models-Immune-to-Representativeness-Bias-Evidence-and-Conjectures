To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and assuming that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Nondreamers}}{\text{Total Population}} \]

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.20}} \]
