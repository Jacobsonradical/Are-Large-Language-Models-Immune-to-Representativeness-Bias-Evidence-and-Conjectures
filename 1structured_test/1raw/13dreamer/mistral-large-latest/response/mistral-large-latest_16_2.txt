To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, we can use the following steps:

1. **Identify the probabilities**:
   - Probability of being a Nondreamer: \( P(\text{Nondreamer}) = 0.20 \)
   - Probability of being a Dreamer: \( P(\text{Dreamer}) = 0.80 \)

2. **Assume random mating**:
   - Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

3. **Calculate the probability**:
   - The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is \( 0.20 \).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{probability: } 0.20 \]
