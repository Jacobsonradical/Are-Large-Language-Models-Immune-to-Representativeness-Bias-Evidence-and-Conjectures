Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{probability: } 0.2 \]
