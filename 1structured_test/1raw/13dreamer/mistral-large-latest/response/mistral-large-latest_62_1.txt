Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

The proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{
  "probability": 0.20
