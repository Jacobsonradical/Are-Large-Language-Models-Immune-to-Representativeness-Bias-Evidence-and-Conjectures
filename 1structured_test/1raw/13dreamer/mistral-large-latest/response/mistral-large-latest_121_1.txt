To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the proportion of Nondreamers in the population. Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
