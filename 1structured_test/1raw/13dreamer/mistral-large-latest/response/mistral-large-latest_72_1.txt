To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the random mating assumption. Since mating is random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.20}} \]
