To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the random mating assumption. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.20\} \]
