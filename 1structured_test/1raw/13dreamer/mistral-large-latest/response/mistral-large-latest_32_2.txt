To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the overall distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
