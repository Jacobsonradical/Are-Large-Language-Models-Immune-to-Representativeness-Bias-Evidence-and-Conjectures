Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that any random individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
