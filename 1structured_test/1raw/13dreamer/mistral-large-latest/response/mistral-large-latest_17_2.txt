To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. Given that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and assuming mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.20}} \]
