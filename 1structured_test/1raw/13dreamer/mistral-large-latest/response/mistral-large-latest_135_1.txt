Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the assumption that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population.

Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \text{probability: } 0.2 \]
