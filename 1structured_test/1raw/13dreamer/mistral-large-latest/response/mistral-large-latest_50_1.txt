Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is not affected by his dreaming status because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.2}} \]
