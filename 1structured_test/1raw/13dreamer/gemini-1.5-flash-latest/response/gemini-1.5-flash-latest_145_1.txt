{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* We are told mating is random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means that a person's dreaming status (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
