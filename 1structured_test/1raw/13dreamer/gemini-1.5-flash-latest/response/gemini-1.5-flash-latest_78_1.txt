{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* We're told mating is random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his status as a Nondreamer.
* The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
