{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* **Probability of Nondreamer:** We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* **Therefore:**  The probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
