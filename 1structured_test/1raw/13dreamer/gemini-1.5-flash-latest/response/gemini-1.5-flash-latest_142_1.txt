{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We're told that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means there's no relationship between whether someone dreams and whether their partner does.
* Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **20% or 0.2**.
