{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
* We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
