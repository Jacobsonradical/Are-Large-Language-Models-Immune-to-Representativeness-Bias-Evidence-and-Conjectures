{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means that Brett's wife's dream status is independent of his own.
* The problem also states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
