{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his own.
* We are told that 20% of people are "Nondreamers". 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2.
