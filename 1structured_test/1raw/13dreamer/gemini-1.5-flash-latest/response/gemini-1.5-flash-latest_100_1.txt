{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dreaming status is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* **Probability of Nondreamers:** We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Since these events are independent, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
