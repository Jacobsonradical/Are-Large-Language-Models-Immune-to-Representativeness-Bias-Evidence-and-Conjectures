Here's why:

The information provided states that mating is completely random. This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
