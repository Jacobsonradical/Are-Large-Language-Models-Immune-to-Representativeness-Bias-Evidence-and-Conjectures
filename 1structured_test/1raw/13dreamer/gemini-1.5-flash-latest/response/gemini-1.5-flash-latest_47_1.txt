{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
