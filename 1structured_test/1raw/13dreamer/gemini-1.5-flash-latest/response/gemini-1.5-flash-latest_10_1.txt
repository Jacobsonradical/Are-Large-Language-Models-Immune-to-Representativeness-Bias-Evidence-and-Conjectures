{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
*  Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
