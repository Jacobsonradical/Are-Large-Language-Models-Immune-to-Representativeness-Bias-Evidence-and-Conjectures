{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no influence on their partner's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his status.  Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
