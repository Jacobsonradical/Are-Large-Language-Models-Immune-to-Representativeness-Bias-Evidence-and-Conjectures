{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
