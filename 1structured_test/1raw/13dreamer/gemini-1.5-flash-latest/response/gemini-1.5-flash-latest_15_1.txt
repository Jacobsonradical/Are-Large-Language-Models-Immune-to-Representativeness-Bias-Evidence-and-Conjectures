{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* We are told that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dreaming status is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's dreaming status is independent, the probability that she is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
