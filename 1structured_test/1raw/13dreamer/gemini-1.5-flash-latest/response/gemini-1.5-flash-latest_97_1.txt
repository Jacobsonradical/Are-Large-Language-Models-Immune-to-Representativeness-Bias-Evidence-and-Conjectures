{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no relationship between whether one person dreams and whether their spouse does.
* The information about 80% of people being dreamers and 20% being non-dreamers is relevant to the general population, but it doesn't change the fact that Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his own.
* Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
