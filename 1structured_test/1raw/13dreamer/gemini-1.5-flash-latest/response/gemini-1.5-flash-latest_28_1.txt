{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means that whether or not someone dreams has no influence on whether their spouse dreams. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his status as a Nondreamer.  Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
