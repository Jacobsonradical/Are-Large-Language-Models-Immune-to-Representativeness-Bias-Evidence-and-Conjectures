{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means there's no connection between whether one person dreams and whether their spouse does.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
