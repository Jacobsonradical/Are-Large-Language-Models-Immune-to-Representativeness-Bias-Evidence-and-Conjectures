{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no connection between Brett's dreaming status and his wife's.
*  We know that 20% of the population are Nondreamers. 
*  Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the population: 20% or 0.2.
