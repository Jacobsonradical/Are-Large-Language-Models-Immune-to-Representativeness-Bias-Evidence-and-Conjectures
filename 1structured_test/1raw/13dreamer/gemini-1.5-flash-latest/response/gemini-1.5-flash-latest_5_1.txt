* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no relationship between whether someone dreams and their partner's dreaming habits.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
