{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* **Independence:** The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dreaming status is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* **Probability of Nondreamers:** The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Since Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't influence his wife's dreaming status, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
