{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no connection between whether someone dreams or not and who they marry.
*  We know 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of his status and remains at the general population rate of 20%.
