{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dreaming status is independent of their partner's dreaming status.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
