{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* We are told that mating is completely random. 
* This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
* The overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, as stated in the problem. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
