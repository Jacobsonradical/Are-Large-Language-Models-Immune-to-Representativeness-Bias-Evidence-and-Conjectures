{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no connection between whether one person dreams and whether their spouse does.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
