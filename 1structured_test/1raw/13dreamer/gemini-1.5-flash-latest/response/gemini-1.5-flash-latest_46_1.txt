{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means that Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his own.
* We know that 20% of the population are Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
