{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The passage states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
* The passage also states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
