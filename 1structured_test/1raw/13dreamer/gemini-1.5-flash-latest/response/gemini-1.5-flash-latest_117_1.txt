{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer.
* We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
