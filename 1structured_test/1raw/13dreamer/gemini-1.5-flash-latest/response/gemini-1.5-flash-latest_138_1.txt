{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of their partner being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is **0.2**.
