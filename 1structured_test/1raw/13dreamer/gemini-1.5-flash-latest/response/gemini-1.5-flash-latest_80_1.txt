{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's wife's dreaming habits are independent of his.
* The problem also states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the population that are Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
