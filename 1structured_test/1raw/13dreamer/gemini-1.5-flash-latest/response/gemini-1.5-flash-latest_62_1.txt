{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
