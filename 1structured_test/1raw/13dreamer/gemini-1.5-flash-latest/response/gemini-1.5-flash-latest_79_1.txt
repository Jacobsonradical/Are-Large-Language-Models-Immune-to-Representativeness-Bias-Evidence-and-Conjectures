{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Random Mating:** The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means a Nondreamer's spouse has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as any other person in the population.
* **Independent Events:** Since mating is random, Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his. 
* **Population Probability:** We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
