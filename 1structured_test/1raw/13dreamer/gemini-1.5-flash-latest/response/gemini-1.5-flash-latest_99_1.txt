{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no relationship between Brett's dreaming status and his wife's dreaming status.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Since their dreaming status is independent, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
