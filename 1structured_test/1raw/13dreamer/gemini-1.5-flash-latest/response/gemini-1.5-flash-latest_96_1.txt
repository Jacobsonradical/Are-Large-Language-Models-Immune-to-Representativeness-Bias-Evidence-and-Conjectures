{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
* Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
