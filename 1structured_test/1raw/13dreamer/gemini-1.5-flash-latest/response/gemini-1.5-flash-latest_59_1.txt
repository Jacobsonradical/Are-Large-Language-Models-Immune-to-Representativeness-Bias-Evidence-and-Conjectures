{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
* We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
