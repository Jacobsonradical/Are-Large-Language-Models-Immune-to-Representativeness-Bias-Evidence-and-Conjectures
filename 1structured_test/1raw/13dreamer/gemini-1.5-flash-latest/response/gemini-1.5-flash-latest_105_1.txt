* **Independence:** The text states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dreaming habits are independent of their partner's.
* **Individual Probability:** We know 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* **Combined Probability:** Since the events are independent, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
