{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.  This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on his wife's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
