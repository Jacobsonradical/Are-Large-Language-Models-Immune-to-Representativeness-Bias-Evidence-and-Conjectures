{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means a Nondreamer has the same probability of being paired with another Nondreamer as any other person in the population.
* Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
