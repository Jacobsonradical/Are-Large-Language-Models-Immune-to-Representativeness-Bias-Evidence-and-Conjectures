Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
