{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.
*  The overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population is 20%. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
