{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that whether someone dreams or not is independent of their partner's dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers, which is **0.2**.
