Here's why:

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%.
