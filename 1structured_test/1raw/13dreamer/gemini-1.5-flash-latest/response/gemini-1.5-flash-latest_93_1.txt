The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's dreaming status (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent of their partner's dreaming status.  

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
