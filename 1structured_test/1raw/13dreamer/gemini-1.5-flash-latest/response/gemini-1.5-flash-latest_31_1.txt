{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no connection between Brett's dreaming status and his wife's. 
* We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Since there's no relationship between their dreaming habits, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20%, or 0.2.
