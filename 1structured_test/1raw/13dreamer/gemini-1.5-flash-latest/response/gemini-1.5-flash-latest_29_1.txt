{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his status as a Nondreamer.
* The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.
