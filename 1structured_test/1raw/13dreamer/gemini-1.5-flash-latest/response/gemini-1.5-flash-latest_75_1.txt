{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means whether Brett dreams or not has no influence on whether his wife dreams.  
* **Probability of a Nondreamer:** The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Since these are independent events, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
