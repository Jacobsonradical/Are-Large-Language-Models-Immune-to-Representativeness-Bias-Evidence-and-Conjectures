{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random. This means there's no relationship between whether one person dreams and whether their spouse does.
* The problem also states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
