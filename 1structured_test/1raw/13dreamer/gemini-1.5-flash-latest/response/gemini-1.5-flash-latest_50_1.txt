{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that a person's dream status (Dreamer or Nondreamer) has no influence on their partner's dream status.
* We know that 20% of the population are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
