{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The passage states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on their partner's likelihood of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply **20% or 0.2**.
