The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is independent of his status as a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
