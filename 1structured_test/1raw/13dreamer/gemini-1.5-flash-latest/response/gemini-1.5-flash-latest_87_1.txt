{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means that Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his own.
* The overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20%.
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also 20%, regardless of Brett's status.
