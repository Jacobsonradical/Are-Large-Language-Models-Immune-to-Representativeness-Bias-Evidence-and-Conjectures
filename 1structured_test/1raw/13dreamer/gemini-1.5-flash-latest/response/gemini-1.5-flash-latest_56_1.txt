{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means there's no connection between whether someone dreams and who they marry.
* The problem also states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20%, or 0.2.
