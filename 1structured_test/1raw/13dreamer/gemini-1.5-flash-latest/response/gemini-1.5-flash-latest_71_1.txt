{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming.
* This means the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status.
*  The overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
