{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on his wife's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
