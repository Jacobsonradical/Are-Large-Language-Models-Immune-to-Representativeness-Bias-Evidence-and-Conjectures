* The problem states that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on their partner's dreaming tendencies.
* Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
