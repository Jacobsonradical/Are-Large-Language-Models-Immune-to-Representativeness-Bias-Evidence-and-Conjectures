{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We are told that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.
* This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his status as a Nondreamer.
*  Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
