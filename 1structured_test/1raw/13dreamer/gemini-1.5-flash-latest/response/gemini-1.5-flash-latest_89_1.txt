{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. This means a person's dream status doesn't influence their partner's dream status.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is independent of one's partner, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers: 20% or 0.2.
