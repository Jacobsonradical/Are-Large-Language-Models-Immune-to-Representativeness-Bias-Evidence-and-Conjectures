{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that mating is random with respect to dreaming. 
* This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* The overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20%. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
