To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the law of total probability, if the mating is completely random, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. In other words, P(A|B) = P(A).

P(A) = The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
