To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the population and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

2. The proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
