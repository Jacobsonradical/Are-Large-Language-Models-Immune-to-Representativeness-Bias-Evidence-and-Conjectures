To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the population and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, as mating is random.

P(Brett's wife is a Nondreamer) = P(Selecting a Nondreamer from the population)

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of selecting a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
