To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the conditional probability formula:

P(Wife is Nondreamer | Brett is Nondreamer) = P(Brett is Nondreamer and Wife is Nondreamer) / P(Brett is Nondreamer)

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

P(Brett is Nondreamer and Wife is Nondreamer) = P(Brett is Nondreamer) × P(Wife is Nondreamer)
= 0.2 × 0.2
= 0.04

P(Brett is Nondreamer) = 0.2

Therefore, P(Wife is Nondreamer | Brett is Nondreamer) = 0.04 / 0.2 = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
