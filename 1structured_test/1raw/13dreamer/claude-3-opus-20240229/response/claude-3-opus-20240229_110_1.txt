To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of random mating and apply the given information about the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

In a random mating population, the probability of an individual having a specific trait is independent of their mate's trait. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the frequency of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.2}
