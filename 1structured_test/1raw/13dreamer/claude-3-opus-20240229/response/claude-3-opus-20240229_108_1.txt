To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population, since mating is random with respect to dreaming.

P(Wife is Nondreamer) = P(Randomly selecting a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
