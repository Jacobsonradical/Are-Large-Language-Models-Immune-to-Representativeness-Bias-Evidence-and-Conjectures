To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the law of total probability and the fact that mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore:

P(A|B) = P(A)

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, P(A) = 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
