To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the population and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
