To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.
