To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's dreaming status. Therefore, the probability is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
