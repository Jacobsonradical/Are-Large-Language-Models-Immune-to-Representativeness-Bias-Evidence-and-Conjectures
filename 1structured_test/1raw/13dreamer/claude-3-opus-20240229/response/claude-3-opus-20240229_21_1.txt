To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the population and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's calculate the probability:

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.

P(Brett's wife is a Nondreamer) = P(Nondreamer in the population) = 0.20

{probability: 0.20}
