To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
