To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, which is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
