To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of random mating and the given information about the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
