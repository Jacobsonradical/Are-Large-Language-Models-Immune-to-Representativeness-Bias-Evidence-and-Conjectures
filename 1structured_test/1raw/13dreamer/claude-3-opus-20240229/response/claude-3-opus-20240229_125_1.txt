To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the population proportions and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
