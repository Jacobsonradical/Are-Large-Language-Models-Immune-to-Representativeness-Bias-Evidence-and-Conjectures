To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, since mating is random and independent of dreaming status.

{probability: 0.2}
