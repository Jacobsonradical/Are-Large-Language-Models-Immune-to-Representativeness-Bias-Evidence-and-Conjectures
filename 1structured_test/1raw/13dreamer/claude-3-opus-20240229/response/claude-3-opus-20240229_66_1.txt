To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A).

P(A) is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
