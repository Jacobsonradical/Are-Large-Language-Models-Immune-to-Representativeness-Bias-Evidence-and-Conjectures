To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
