To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the law of total probability, when mating is random, P(A|B) = P(A). In other words, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.20 (the probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the general population).

{probability: 0.20}
