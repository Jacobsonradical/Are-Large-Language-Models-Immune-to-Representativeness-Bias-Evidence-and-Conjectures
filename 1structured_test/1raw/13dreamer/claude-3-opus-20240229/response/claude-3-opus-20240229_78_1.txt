To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- ND: Nondreamer
- D: Dreamer

We want to find P(Wife is ND | Brett is ND), which is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the problem statement, mating is completely random with respect to dreaming. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, P(Wife is ND | Brett is ND) = P(Wife is ND) = 0.20 (or 20%)

{probability: 0.20}
