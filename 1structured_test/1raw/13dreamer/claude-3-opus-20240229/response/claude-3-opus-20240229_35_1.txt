To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore:
P(B|A) = P(B|not A) = P(B)

We know that P(B) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
