To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Let's call the event of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer as "W".

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability of W is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(W) = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
