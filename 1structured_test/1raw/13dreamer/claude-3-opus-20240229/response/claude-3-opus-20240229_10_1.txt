To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the population and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.

Probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer = Proportion of Nondreamers in the population
Probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
