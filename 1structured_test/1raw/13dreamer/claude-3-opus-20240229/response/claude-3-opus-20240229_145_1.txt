To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the population distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers, and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, as mating is random and independent of dreaming status.

P(Brett's wife is a Nondreamer) = P(selecting a Nondreamer from the population)
P(selecting a Nondreamer from the population) = 20% = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
