To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

According to the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A|B) × P(B) + P(A|not B) × P(not B)

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore:
P(A|B) = P(A|not B) = P(A)

We know that P(A) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
