In this problem, we need to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's dreaming status. The probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
