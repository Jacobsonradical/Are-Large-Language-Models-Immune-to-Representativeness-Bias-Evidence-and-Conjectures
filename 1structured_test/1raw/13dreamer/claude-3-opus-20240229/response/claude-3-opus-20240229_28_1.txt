To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the population, as mating is random.

Probability of selecting a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
