To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of random mating and the given probabilities of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person in the population being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
