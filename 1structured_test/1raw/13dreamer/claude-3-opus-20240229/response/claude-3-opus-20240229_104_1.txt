To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, regardless of Brett's status.

{probability: 0.2}
