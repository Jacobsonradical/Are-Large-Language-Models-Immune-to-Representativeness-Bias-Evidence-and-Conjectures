To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.

Probability of being a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

{probability: 0.2}
