To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population and the fact that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
