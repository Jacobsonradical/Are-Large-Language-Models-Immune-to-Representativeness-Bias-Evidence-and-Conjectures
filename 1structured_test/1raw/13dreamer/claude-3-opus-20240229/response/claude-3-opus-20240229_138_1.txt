To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and apply the concept of random mating.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population.

The probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
