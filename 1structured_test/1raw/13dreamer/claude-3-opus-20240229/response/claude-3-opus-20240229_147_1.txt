To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

The probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).

{probability: 0.2}
