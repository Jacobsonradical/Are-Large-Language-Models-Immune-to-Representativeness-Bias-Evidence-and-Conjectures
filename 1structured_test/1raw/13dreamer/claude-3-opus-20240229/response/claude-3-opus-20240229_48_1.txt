To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
