In this scenario, we have the following information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider that the probability of being a Nondreamer is independent of the spouse's dreaming status, as mating is completely random.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
