To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of probability in mating. Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
