To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Let's denote the probability of being a Nondreamer as P(N) = 0.2 and the probability of being a Dreamer as P(D) = 0.8.

Since mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.
