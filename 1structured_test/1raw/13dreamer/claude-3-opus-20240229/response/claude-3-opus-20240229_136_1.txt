In this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer and mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, we can simply use the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2, since mating is random and independent of the dreaming trait.

{probability: 0.2}
