To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

Since mating is random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.2}
