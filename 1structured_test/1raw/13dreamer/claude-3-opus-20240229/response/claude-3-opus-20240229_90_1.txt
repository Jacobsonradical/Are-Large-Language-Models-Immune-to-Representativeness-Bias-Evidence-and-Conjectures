To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of random mating and apply the given information about the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, as mating is completely random.

{probability: 0.2}
