To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Mating is completely random with respect to dreaming.

We want to find P(Wife is Nondreamer | Brett is Nondreamer).

According to the law of total probability, in this case:
P(Wife is Nondreamer | Brett is Nondreamer) = P(Wife is Nondreamer)

This is because mating is completely random with respect to dreaming, so the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not.

P(Wife is Nondreamer) = 0.2 (as given in the problem statement)

Therefore,
{probability: 0.2}
