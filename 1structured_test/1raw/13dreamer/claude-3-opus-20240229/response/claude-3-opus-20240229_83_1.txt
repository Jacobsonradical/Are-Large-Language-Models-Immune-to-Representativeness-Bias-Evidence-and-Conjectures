To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Since mating is completely random, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
