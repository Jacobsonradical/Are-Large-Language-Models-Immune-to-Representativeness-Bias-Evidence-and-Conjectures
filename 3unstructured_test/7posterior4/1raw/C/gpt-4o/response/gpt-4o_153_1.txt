To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need more specific data. Generally, Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), it's challenging to calculate an accurate probability. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the details provided.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are traits that fit well with the field of computer science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns with problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- Although his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature aren't directly related to computer science, they do not exclude the possibility.

Given these points, a qualitative estimate might be reasonable, but it should be noted this is not a precise calculation.

Based on these qualitative considerations, I would estimate the probability to be moderately high but not definitive. A reasonable qualitative probability might be around 0.6, given the alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking.

Thus, the answer in the specified format is:

  "computer science": 0.6
