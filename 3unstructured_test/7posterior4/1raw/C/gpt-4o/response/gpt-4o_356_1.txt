To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering his personality sketch. This could be approximated based on general statistics or assumptions, but for this example, let's assume a prior probability.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: This is what we're trying to find.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To simplify, let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical traits of computer science students and the provided sketch:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.2, based on the percentage of graduate students enrolled in computer science programs.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
  - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with the traits required for computer science. 
  - His quiet nature and puzzle-solving enjoyment also align well with common traits in this field.
  - His strong empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant but don't contradict enrollment in computer science.

  Therefore, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.6.

- **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is more complex to estimate without more data, but for the sake of calculation, let's assume \( P(E) \) is relatively high due to the overlapping traits and additional interests. We will estimate \( P(E) \) as 0.4.

Applying the numbers to Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 * 0.2}{0.4} = 0.3
\]

So, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.3 or 30%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
