To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (Adam was enrolled in computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam’s personality sketch).

Let's make some assumptions and estimations to derive a value:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) could be the proportion of students enrolled in computer science. Suppose it's an average university, and 10% of students are in computer science.
   - So, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, let’s evaluate how likely a computer science student would fit the description:
     - High intelligence (common in computer science).
     - Understanding abstract concepts (common in computer science).
     - Curiosity about nature/plants, warm heart, and empathy (not typical traits strongly associated with computer science, but not exclusive).

   Assign an arbitrary likelihood rating of 0.3 that such a personality sketch would apply to a computer science student.

3. **Overall Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \) is challenging to define without more data, but we can treat it as a normalization constant to ensure probabilities sum to 1. Assume a rough value of 0.5 to account for varied fields matching this profile.

Using these estimates, we can plug them into Bayes' formula:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.06 
\]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.06.

Please note that these values are based on arbitrary estimations and assumptions. More accurate data would provide a more precise calculation.
