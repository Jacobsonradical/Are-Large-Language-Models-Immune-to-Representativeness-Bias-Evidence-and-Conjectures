To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, you haven't provided these values directly, so we'll make reasoned assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Given \( E \) and the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, here is a rough qualitative assessment:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Letâ€™s assume that the likelihood of a student enrolling in computer science as a graduate field, in general, is moderate. 
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch indicates a high intelligence and an affinity for abstract concepts, qualities that are beneficial in computer science. However, there is no direct mention of skills or interests specifically aligned with computer science (like programming, algorithms, etc.), but solving puzzles can be associated with coding challenges.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This concerns the likelihood of seeing the personality traits described in someone enrolled in any field, not just computer science.

Without specific numerical values, the exact computation isn't possible, so we base this on plausibility:

- Given Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking, but considering his stronger leanings towards nature, animals, and empathy over technical fields, we might give a reasonably lower value to the hypothesis of computer science.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) might be estimated to be somewhat lower, but not impossible.

This estimate suggests a relatively lower likelihood considering his stronger natural inclinations might steer him towards fields like biology or environmental science, but also keeps open the possibility that his problem-solving skills might align with computer science pursuits.
