To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we typically need prior probabilities for the hypothesis H and evidence E, as well as the likelihood of E given H.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities (i.e., \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \)), we cannot compute an exact numerical value. However, based on the personality sketch (E), we can qualitatively infer the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science.

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts. These traits could indeed be aligned with a field like computer science. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might make fields like biology or environmental science equally or more likely.

Given this qualitative assessment, I would assign a moderate posterior probability to the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science without precise quantitative data.

Therefore, I will make an educated guess within the specified constraints:
