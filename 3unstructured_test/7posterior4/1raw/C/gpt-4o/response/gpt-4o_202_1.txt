To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following values:
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. Evidence \( P(E) \) which is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch regardless of his field.

However, these probabilities are not provided; thus, we must make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information and general knowledge.

Let’s assume the following:
1. Adam's personality is moderately likely for someone in computer science, considering his high intelligence and fascination with solving puzzles, which align well with the analytical nature of the field. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less typical in this field. \
\
Thus, let's approximate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.
2. Prior probability \( P(H) \) can be reasonably assumed as well. Given the many fields a graduate student might be in, let's assume there’s a relatively even distribution across popular disciplines in the U.S. We could assign a rough estimate like 1 in 10 fields being computer science. Therefore, \( P(H) \) ≈ 0.1.
3. The probability \( P(E) \) represents the total probability of Adam's personality traits across all possible fields. Given the nature of his traits, let's estimate \( P(E) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.133 \]

So the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, based on the personality sketch provided, is approximately 0.133.
