To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), it is impossible to compute an exact numerical value. Instead, we can provide a qualitative interpretation based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, several factors could hint at his potential field of study:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This suggests a higher likelihood of a field related to biology, botany, or environmental sciences rather than computer science.
2. **Strong empathy and a deep love for animals**: This also leans towards fields like veterinary sciences, zoology, or related life sciences.
3. **Enjoys solving puzzles and high intelligence**: These traits positively correlate with fields that require strong problem-solving skills, which include computer science, engineering, and mathematics.
4. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is broadly applicable and doesn’t specifically point to computer science.

Understanding this: 
- The traits that support a field like computer science are his enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
- Traits that lean away from computer science include his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, which are more central to life sciences.

Given these observations, while it is not impossible for Adam to be in computer science, the relative probability compared to life sciences might be lower. Assuming a distribution pattern where life sciences are highly probable and computer science somewhat probable, we could qualitatively estimate the probability.

Thus, qualitatively:

\[
P(H|E) \text{ for computer science }
\]

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Please note that the given probability is an estimated value based on a qualitative assessment of Adam’s personality sketch and how it aligns with typical profiles in computer science. It is not computed from actual data and should be used with caution.
