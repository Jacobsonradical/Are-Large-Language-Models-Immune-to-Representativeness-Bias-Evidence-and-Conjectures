To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a numerical value for this probability, we need specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), which are not provided directly in the problem statement. Therefore, the result will be an educated estimate based on the context provided in the personality sketch.

- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Considering traits like high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, one might reasonably estimate a high probability here.

- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being a computer science student among all possible fields of study for graduate students in the U.S. 

- **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality traits described, irrespective of the field of study.

Since we don't have exact numerical data, let's provide an educated guess based on the context:

- Given Adam's traits such as intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving, it is reasonable to assume a higher likelihood that he might be a computer science student.
- Taking into account the average distribution of fields among graduate students, let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderately probable for computer science graduates.

Given these assumptions, let's estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.6 \]
