To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we'd generally need more specific information about the prior probabilities P(H) of Adam being enrolled in the computer science field, the likelihood P(E|H) that a computer science student would have Adam's characteristics, and the overall probability P(E) of having those characteristics regardless of the field. Given that we don't have this detailed data, we can only give a subjective estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

From the personality sketch, let's summarize the key characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Considering these characteristics, let's try to infer how likely it is that Adam, with these traits, is enrolled in computer science:

1. Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence, especially in abstract concepts, are strong indicators of a good fit for computer science.
2. Having a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals could be seen as less directly related to computer science but does not rule it out. Many computer scientists also have varied interests and empathetic qualities.
3. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants seems more aligned with natural sciences or biology. Appreciation for hard work and dedication is a neutral trait that applies to many fields.

Given the mix of traits, the likelihood isn't extremely high but reasonable due to the emphasis on abstract thinking and puzzle solving. Assuming no specific prior probabilities, we might afford a moderate value.

Thus, with the subjective reasoning based on the aforementioned analysis:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

This value represents a reasonable estimate considering Adam's personality characteristics without detailed prior probabilities or a more rigorous statistical foundation.
