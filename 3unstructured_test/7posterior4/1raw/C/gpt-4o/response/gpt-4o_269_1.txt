To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of the personality sketch given that hypothesis, and the overall probability of the personality sketch across all possible fields. However, since we do not have the actual numerical values or any additional context, we must base our answer on qualitative factors inferred from the personality sketch.

Given Adam's described personality traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits suggest a proclivity toward fields that often involve nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Computer science certainly requires intelligence and the ability to solve abstract problems, but it might not directly align with his interest in nature and animals. 

Given this qualitative analysis, we might infer that the likelihood of Adam being in a field like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine might be higher than computer science.

Nevertheless, if we have to provide an estimated value for the probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value reflects that, while computer science is a plausible field given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, it may not be the most aligned with his specified interests and empathy for nature and animals.
