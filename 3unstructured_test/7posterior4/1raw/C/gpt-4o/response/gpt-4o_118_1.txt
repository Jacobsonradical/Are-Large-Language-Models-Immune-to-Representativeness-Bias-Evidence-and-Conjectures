Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this calculation, we would typically need:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch E given H.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of H (Adam being enrolled in computer science).
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch E.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will assume reasonable approximations based on typical information.

Let's make some initial estimates:

1. \( P(E|H) \): Considering that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with good abstract thinking, there is a reasonable likelihood that these traits align well with a computer science student. We can estimate this probability as moderate to high, say 0.6.
  
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability for Adam being in computer science can be approximated by looking at the distribution of graduate students' enrollment across fields. Assuming an equal distribution among various fields for simplicity, we can estimate this as 0.1.

3. \( P(E) \): This is tricky, but if we assume that the personality sketch fits well with several potential fields (such as life sciences, engineering, etc.), we can estimate this probability again as moderate, say 0.2.

Now, plugging these values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.3 \]

So, the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.3.
