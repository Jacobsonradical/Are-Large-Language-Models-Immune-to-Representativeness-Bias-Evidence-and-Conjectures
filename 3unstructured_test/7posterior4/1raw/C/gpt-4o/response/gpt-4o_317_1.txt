To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the components of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, it's important to note that without actual numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't calculate the exact posterior probability. For this exercise, let's assume some plausible estimations based on the personality sketch and our understanding of typical characteristics of students in the field of computer science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Hypothetically, let's assume a base rate of graduate students in computer science. We'll place this at 0.2 (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adamâ€™s characteristics:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is also a good fit for problem-solving in computer science.
   - However, strong empathy and love for nature/animals might be less correlated.
   
   Let's assign a moderate likelihood due to mixed traits and say \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \) (50%).

3. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch occurring in general across all fields. Assuming a standard mix of students' characteristics across various fields, we can place this at 0.4 (40%).

Using these hypothetical numbers in Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.1}{0.4} = 0.25 \]

Given our estimations, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is 0.25.

Therefore:

  "computer science": "0.25"
