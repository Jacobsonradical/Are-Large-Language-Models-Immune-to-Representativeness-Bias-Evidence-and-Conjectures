To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam being enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E, we would normally need various probabilities which are not provided directly in the query. These include:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The normalizing constant, which ensures the probabilities sum to 1.

However, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the given information about Adam’s personality traits and his interests.

Given:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are common traits among computer science students.
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, which is less directly related to computer science.
- Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, which is applicable to many fields including computer science.

If we assume that personality traits such as enjoying solving puzzles, having high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts highly correlate with the field of computer science, we might estimate a higher probability than for completely unrelated fields.

Therefore, based on this heuristic reasoning and given the absence of specific statistical data, one can roughly estimate the probability between 0 and 1 to reflect these traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

This estimation acknowledges the connection between Adam’s traits and common traits of computer science students, albeit recognizing the necessity for actual data for precise computation.
