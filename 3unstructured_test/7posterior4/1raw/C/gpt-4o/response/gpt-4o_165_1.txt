To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering his personality sketch.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if we assume he is enrolled in computer science.
- **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this calculation, specific numerical values are not provided in the problem statement, so we must make informed assumptions based on the given information.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is \( P(H) = 0.1 \). This is a reasonable starting point without additional data, assuming equal probability among different fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Consider how well Adam's personality sketch fits a typical computer science student. Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which are traits commonly found in computer science students. Therefore, let's assume a high likelihood: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - The evidence should account for how likely Adam's personality traits are across all fields of study. Given Adam's traits such as empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is likely that these traits fit well in many fields. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.07}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is 0.14.
