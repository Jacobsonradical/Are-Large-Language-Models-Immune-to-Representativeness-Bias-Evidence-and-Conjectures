To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) given that the hypothesis (H) is true.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis (H) being true.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence (E) regardless of the hypothesis.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's apply this to the given information about Adam and the field of computer science.

Given:
- E: Personality sketch of Adam
- H: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021

For illustrative purposes, I'll make some plausible assumptions:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a student in computer science would have Adam's described personality.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of any given graduate student being in computer science.
  
Let's assume:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \) (tackles abstract concepts fits for comp sci but empathy and love for nature is less typical)
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (computer science is one of many fields)

\( P(E) \), the overall probability of someone having Adam's personality, can be considered summing across various fields.

Assuming an indicative estimate \( P(E) = 0.3 \):

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Thus, the posterior probability:
