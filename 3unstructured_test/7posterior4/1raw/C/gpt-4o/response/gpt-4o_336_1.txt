To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \)) given in the problem. Instead, we'll make a qualitative assessment based on Adam's described characteristics and the typical traits of someone in the field of computer science.

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants** - A trait more common among biologists or environmental scientists than computer scientists.
2. **Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles** - This aligns well with computer science since problem-solving is foundational to the field.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals** - These traits are not the primary indicators for computer science but do not exclude it either.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts** - Very relevant to computer science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** - Relevant but common across many fields.

Although Adam's traits could fit into several fields, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts particularly align with computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments without precise probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This indicates a reasonable but not absolute probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, based on the given personality sketch and the nature of the field.
