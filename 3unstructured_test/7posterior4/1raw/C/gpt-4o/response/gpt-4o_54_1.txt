To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following elements:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam given that he was enrolled in the field of computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The prior probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam without regard to his field of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make some assumptions since we do not have exact probability values:

- Assume \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality if he is in computer science. Given that computer science often appeals to people who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence, we might estimate this to be moderately high, say 0.7.
- Assume \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that there are many fields he could have chosen, let’s assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality overall. As his personality traits are fairly general but somewhat specific to certain interests, let’s estimate this as moderate too, say 0.3.

Putting these together:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.4667 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E can be estimated as:
