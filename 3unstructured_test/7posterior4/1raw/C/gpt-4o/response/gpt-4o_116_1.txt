To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
1. The prior probability \( P(H) \): The general probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since specific numerical values for the probabilities are not provided, assumptions or estimations must be made. Generally speaking, the typical prior probability for a given field can be assumed based on statistical data about the prevalence of that field among graduate students. To simplify, let's assume:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a graduate student is in computer science is about 0.25 (25%).
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is lower because Adam's personality traits (love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles) are not strongly correlated with computer science, but his intelligence might suggest some potential fit. Let's estimate this as 0.15 (15%).
- The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits within the general population of graduate students, which we can estimate as 0.20 (20%).

Plugging these into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.25}{0.20} = \frac{0.0375}{0.20} = 0.1875 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.1875.
