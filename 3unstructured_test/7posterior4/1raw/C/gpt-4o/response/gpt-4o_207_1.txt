To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will have to rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate \( P(H|E) \).

Given the following points from the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Adam has a love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a high level of intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

While computer science is a field that involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might suggest fields related to biology, environmental science, or other life sciences more than computer science.

Given these considerations, we can qualitatively estimate \( P(H|E) \) for computer science to be relatively low compared to fields that align more directly with his interests in nature and animals. Keeping this in mind:
