To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given the personality sketch \( E \), we would ideally need prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. 

However, without specific numeric values for priors and likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative judgment based on the information provided in personality sketch \( E \). 

Adam's interests and characteristics (curiosity about nature and plants, a love for solving puzzles, intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, empathy, and love for animals) do not strongly point towards or away from computer science. Based on this, I can provide a qualitative estimate that considers both typical traits of a computer science student and Adam's described traits.

Here's the estimate for the probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

This value suggests there is an equal probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science as there is in other fields, based on the given sketch and without additional information.
