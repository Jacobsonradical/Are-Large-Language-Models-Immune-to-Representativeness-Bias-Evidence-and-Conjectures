  "computer science": "Given the information, we cannot compute the exact posterior probability P(H|E) without knowing the prior probabilities and likelihoods associated with Adam's field of study. However, considering his high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts, we can estimate a moderate probability. For the sake of this illustration, let's approximate it to be around 0.3."
