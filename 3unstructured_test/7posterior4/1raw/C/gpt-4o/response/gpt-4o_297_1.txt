To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several components:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on possible field distributions for graduate students in the U.S.
2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: The probability of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence (\( P(E) \))**: The overall probability of observing E.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to limited data, we can't compute exact values for these probabilities quantitatively. Instead, we can make informed qualitative assessments:

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** 
  - Graduate students in computer science are relatively common, suggesting a notable prior probability.

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** 
  - Computer science students can have a high degree of intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, aligning well with some aspects of Adam's personality.
  - However, computer science students may not typically have a strong focus on nature, plants, or deep empathy towards animals, suggesting a lower likelihood for this aspect.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) would be somewhat reduced because while Adam's traits of intelligence and puzzle-solving fit computer science, his love for nature and animals does not fit as closely.

A reasonable estimated qualitative probability might fall slightly below the midpoint of the probability spectrum.

Note: This is an informed qualitative estimate and should be treated as such due to the inherent limitations of not having precise statistical data for the components.
