To apply Bayes' rule, we need several pieces of information that are not provided directly in the problem statement, such as the prior probability of each field and the likelihood of each field producing the personality traits described in E. Without these pieces of information, we can't precisely calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \).

However, I can discuss the qualitative aspects that may influence the posterior probability.

Given the provided personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
2. A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles
3. Warm heart
4. Strong empathy
5. Deep love for animals
6. High intelligence
7. Good at understanding abstract concepts
8. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can infer that some of these traits might be more common in certain academic fields. For computer science, relevant traits might include:
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given this qualitative assessment, if we assume a reasonable prior and likelihood based on these traits, we might estimate that the probability is relatively high, but without numeric values for priors and likelihoods, we can't give an exact probability. 

For the sake of illustration, let's assume:

{
  "computer science": 0.7
}

This is just a rough estimate based on the compatibility of the personality traits with the field of computer science. The actual posterior probability would depend on more specific prior and likelihood data.
