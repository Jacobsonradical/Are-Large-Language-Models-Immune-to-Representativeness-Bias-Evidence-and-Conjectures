To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know:
1. The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science, \( P(E|H) \).
3. The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), \( P(E) \).

Without specific numerical data for the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the total probability \( P(E) \), we canâ€™t compute the exact posterior probability. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given traits.

Adam has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants. These characteristics suggest an alignment with fields like biology, environmental science, or similar areas rather than computer science. Although his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are traits that also align with computer science, his core interests appear to be more aligned with natural sciences.

Given these qualitative assessments, the probability \( P(H|E) \) might lean lower for computer science.

This is a hypothetical estimation given the qualitative assessment, implying a lower likelihood that Adam is enrolled in computer science based on the provided personality sketch E. For a precise calculation, specific numerical probabilities would be required.
