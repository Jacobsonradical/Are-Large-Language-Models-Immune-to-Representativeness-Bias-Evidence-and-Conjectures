To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have a few more pieces of information, such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of his personality traits given that he is in computer science (\( P(E|H) \)), and the overall probability of his personality traits (\( P(E) \)). However, since this information is not provided, I will have to use a qualitative analysis based on the description of Adam's personality traits and their compatibility with the field of computer science.

Given Adam's profile:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals.

A field like computer science generally suits individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which matches Adam's traits well. However, his strong empathy and love for animals might suggest he could equally be drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.

Therefore, based on this qualitative analysis, if we had to assign a probability value based on how well his traits match the field of computer science, we might estimate:

\( P(H|E) \approx 0.4 \)

So, the answer would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
