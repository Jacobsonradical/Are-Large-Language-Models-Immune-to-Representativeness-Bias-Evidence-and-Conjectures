In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this scenario, we do not have the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics of graduate students in computer science.

Given Adam's attributes:
- High intelligence.
- Good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants (not directly related to computer science, but indicates a broad and analytical mind).

These characteristics do align well with those often found in computer science students, who typically exhibit strong problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and high intelligence.

Without exact numerical values, only a qualitative assessment can be given. Nonetheless, assuming the attributes closely align with what is generally expected in computer science, we can estimate a high posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.75"
}

This qualitative estimate of 0.75 reflects strong alignment with typical traits of computer science students while acknowledging the specificity about nature and plants may lessen, but does not nullify, the likelihood.
