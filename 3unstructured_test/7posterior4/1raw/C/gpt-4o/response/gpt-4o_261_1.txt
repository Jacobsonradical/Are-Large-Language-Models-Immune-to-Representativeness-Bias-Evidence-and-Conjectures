To calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have certain pieces of information like the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). These probability values are typically derived from data or domain knowledge, which we don't have available in this context. Nevertheless, given the description, we can qualitatively estimate our posterior probability based on how well the personality traits match typical characteristics of students in computer science.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information provided:

1. Posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is what we are solving for â€“ the probability Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
2. Prior probability \( P(H) \) is the initial estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is a computer science student.
4. Evidence \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of anyone having Adam's personality traits. 

Without exact values, we assume that Adam's personality traits provide a moderate to strong match for a computer science field, considering the combination of intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. Thus, we can estimate a qualitative probability.

Here is the result based on a reasoned estimate:

  "computer science": "0.7"

This estimation accounts for a reasonable alignment between the personality traits described and typical traits valued in computer science studies, though acknowledging that different graduate fields could also fit the description well.
