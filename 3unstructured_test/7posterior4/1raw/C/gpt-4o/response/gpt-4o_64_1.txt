To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to estimate the following components:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a computer science program.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a computer science program.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have concrete statistical data to input exact values, we need to rely on qualitative reasoning to make an educated estimate.

Let's make a few reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume a general prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science. Let's use 0.2 as a rough estimate, which means 20% chance based on the general make-up of graduate programs.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's qualities (high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work) which align with typical traits seen in computer science students, let's assume a high likelihood, say 0.7.
   
3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits occurring in any field could be found by weighing the likelihood across all fields. Given the traits (such as empathy and love for animals), it may be more common for fields like biology or environmental science but also possible in computer science. Let's assign a rough probability of 0.1 based on the diverse nature of these traits across different fields.

By applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = \frac{0.14}{0.1} = 1.4 \]

Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, this normalized value suggests we've likely overestimated the likelihood or underestimated the overall probability. Let's adjust slightly:

Adjusting \( P(E) \) to 0.2 (considering the diversity of students' traits across all fields):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = \frac{0.14}{0.2} = 0.7 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.7.

Therefore, the answer is:

  "computer science": "0.7"
