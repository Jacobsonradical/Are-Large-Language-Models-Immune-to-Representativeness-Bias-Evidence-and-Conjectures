To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we utilize Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step outline to estimate this probability:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. If no specific prior information is provided, we generally assume a uniform distribution. However, given the multitude of fields, we'll use a general assumption that any specific field has a low prior probability.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is enrolled in computer science. For this, we consider how well Adam's traits align with what we expect from computer science students:
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - Interest in puzzles aligns with problem-solving skills.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy are not negatively correlated but not strongly indicative of computer science either.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields of study. It sums up how common these traits are irrespective of the field.

Given that we are working with qualitative estimates rather than precise numerical data, we'll make an educated guess based on the provided information.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Assume an even chance among many fields, thus something on the order of \( \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is large. Let's tentatively set this to 0.05 (5%).
- \( P(E|H) \): Considering the suitability of his traits for computer science, let's assign a probability of 0.7 (70%).
- \( P(E) \): The probability of these traits appearing in any field might be moderate. Let's set this to 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7) \cdot (0.05)}{0.3} \approx 0.1167 \]

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.117 \]

Here is the formatted answer:
