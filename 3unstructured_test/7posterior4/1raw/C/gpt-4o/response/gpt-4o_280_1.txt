To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science and \( E \) is the given personality sketch of Adam, we need to evaluate the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to compute this exact value, we would need information about prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Given that we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make a qualitative inference based on the provided sketch.

### Qualitative Assessment:
- Adam's interest in nature, plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy might not typically align directly with the stereotypes and common personality traits of a computer science student, who might typically be more focused on technology, coding, and abstract logic.
- However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts do align well with critical skills needed for studying computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is generally a neutral trait that can be important in any field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, while Adam can theoretically be in computer science due to his intelligence and abstract reasoning skills, his strong interest in nature and animals might suggest he is more likely to be in another field related to biology or environmental science. 

So, without exact numerical values, we would need to make an educated guess.
