To answer the question about computing the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we would typically need prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since those are not provided, I'll make a qualitative assessment that aligns with Bayesian reasoning, considering the characteristics described.

Given Adam's high intelligence, capability in understanding abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles, he fits some common traits associated with computer science students. However, his deep love for animals, strong empathy, and natural curiosity about plants could also indicate a different field more directly connected with nature, like biology or environmental science.

For a very rough estimate, I'll provide my subjective assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value represents a moderate belief that Adam could be in computer science based on the traits described, balanced against the possibility of him being in a more nature-focused field. For a more accurate posterior probability, more specific data about the base rates of different fields and the likelihood of the described traits in each field would be necessary.
