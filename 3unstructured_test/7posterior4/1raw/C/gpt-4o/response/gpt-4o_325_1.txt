To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior belief about the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science without considering the personality sketch. This is generally based on general enrollment statistics, but since exact numbers are not provided, we'll assume an even distribution across potential fields. If we assume there are 10 possible fields of study he could be in, then:
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam has a deep appreciation for nature, animals, and enjoys solving puzzles, it somewhat fits with computer science due to the puzzle-solving aspect and abstract concepts. However, it is not a perfect fit as his love for nature and animals may not be directly related to computer science. Letâ€™s estimate \( P(E|H) \) as 0.4.

3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch regardless of the field. This can be complex to calculate without extensive data, but let's assume it is fairly common and estimate it as a baseline probability. If we assume that his interests could fit equally in one of the 10 possible fields of study, then:
\[ P(E) = 1 \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{1} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.04 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science is 0.04.
