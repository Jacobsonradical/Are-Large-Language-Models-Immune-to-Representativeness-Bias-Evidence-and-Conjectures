To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

However, without exact probabilities and more detailed information, it's challenging to provide a precise numerical answer. We can make qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch.

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given the traits listed, these characteristics seem to align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than computer science, which might typically align more with traits like a strong technical inclination, interest in computing, and problem-solving related to software and algorithms.

Based on this qualitative assessment, it is reasonable to provide an estimated lower probability for computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value indicates a lower probability reflecting a less likely match between Adam's personality traits and the typical profile for computer science students.
