To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some parameters: the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given as:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given the information provided, let's proceed with making reasonable assumptions and estimates for these probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** 
   - This is the general probability that any randomly selected graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. Based on some broad data, let's assume approximately 10% (0.10) of graduate students are in computer science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given that he is a computer science student. Considering that Adam has traits like high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fit the profile of a computer science student, but also considering his love for nature, plants, and animals, let's reasonably estimate this probability to be around 0.3. 

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):**
   - This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch among all graduate students, regardless of their field. Given the diverse set of interests and traits described, it's not extremely common but not exceedingly rare either. Let's hypothetically assume this probability to be approximately 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15
\]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.15.

Therefore, the answer is:
