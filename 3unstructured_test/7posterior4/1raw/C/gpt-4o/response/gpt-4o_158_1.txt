To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the provided context, we do not have specific prior probabilities or numerical values for these probabilities. Therefore, an exact numerical value for \( P(H|E) \) cannot be calculated without more data. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the typical traits often associated with computer science students.

Students in computer science often have:
- High intelligence.
- Good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Enjoy solving puzzles.

While Adam's love for nature and animals and his strong empathy might not be the most stereotypical traits associated with computer science students, his intelligence, proficiency in abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well.

Given this qualitative assessment, we could estimate a higher than average probability but less than certain.

So, a reasonable estimation within the spectrum of 0 to 1 might be around 0.7, assuming the prior probabilities of the fields Adam might be enrolled in are not skewed drastically in favor of another field.

{
  "computer science": "0.7"

This value is a subjective estimation considering the personality sketch and common characteristics associated with computer science students. The actual computation would require more specific data.
