To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), summed across all possible fields Adam could be studying.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numeric values for these components (priors, likelihoods, and evidence), we cannot compute an exact numeric value. However, based on the given personality sketch, we can reason about the likelihood qualitatively.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Since computer science is a prevalent field of study, the prior probability could be non-negligible.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: There are elements in Adam's personality sketch that align well with computer science (e.g., high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles).
- **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This includes the probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields of study.

Based on this qualitative reasoning and assuming reasonable distributions of students across various fields, we can recognize that Adam's characteristics could fit well in computer science, but without exact values, our interpretation has to remain at a reasonable estimate.

Therefore, based on these qualitative insights, let's provide a plausible estimated value:
