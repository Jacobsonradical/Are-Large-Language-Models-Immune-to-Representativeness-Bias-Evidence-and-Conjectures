To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numeric data for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will have to make qualitative assessments to estimate the probability.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Suppose the prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science could be inferred from general enrollment statistics. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) if 15% of graduate students in the U.S. enroll in computer science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality sketch mentions an interest in puzzles and high intelligence, which are often traits found in computer science students. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields might be spread out, but fields relevant to puzzles and high intelligence could dominate. Assume \( P(E) = 0.2 \) for simplicity if such traits are less spread out across all fields.

Plugging these into Bayes' rule, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.105}{0.2} = 0.525 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probability is:
