To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we must apply Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given we don't have specific probabilities and must infer from the given information and typical characteristics associated with the field of computer science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Without additional data on graduate student enrollment statistics, we can assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is fairly distributed among various fields.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Many characteristics in the personality sketch (high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, puzzle-solving, understanding abstract concepts) align well with skills and traits beneficial for a computer science degree.
   - However, the specific interests in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals might not be as heavily aligned with computer science specifically.

Given these considerations, let's assign plausible values based on typical graduate student demographics and the alignment of the traits mentioned:

- Assume uniform priors for simplicity, \( P(H) = 1/n \) where \( n \) is the number of fields, but weâ€™ll focus on propensity:
- Suppose \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is relatively high due to the alignment with analytical skills and puzzle-solving.

Combining the general priors and the strong alignment:

{
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

This value of 0.65 is a reasoned estimate reflecting the qualitative fit between Adam's personality and the nature of computer science, recognizing not all traits perfectly align but many important ones do.
