To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to consider several components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a random graduate student was enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that Adam's personality sketch fits the profile of a computer science student.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

It's important to note that exact values for these probabilities are usually based on data or informed priors, but for the sake of this calculation, we will make an educated estimate based on the given information and general knowledge about the field of computer science.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

For simplicity, let's assume the proportion of graduate students in computer science is 0.2 (this can vary depending on the specific demographics of the school).

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

Adam's traits including curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and high intelligence are strong indicators for disciplines requiring analytical and logical skills like computer science. However, his love for nature and animals, and empathy might not be as strongly correlated with computer science as they might be with fields like biology or environmental science. Let's assign a likelihood of 0.6 to reflect that computer science could reasonably encompass these traits, but itâ€™s not a perfect match.

### Evidence \( P(E) \)

To simplify, we can assume that Adam's personality traits are equally likely to occur across all fields, setting \( P(E) = 1 \) because it's the normalization constant.

### Calculation

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the estimates:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.12 \]

Thus, given the personality sketch and our rough estimates, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science is:
