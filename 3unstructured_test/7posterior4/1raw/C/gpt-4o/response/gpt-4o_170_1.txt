To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) being that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the terms:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of field.

To provide an accurate value, we need specific numerical values for these probabilities, which we don't have. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided.

- \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits suggest a person inclined towards fields involving analytical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science, although the strong empathy and love for animals skew this somewhat. Let's assume this probability is moderate, around 0.4.
- \( P(H) \): We don't have specific numbers, so let's assume P(H) might be moderate given the popularity of computer science programs. Let's assume this is 0.2.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing someone with these personality traits across all possible fields. Given the unique combination, let's say this is relatively balanced among several fields. Assume a value of 0.5.

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.08}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.16.

Thus, the answer format is:
