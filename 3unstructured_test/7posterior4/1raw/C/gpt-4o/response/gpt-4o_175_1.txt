To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihood probabilities \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), which are typically derived from domain-specific data that isn't provided here. Therefore, an exact numerical value cannot be determined without these prior probabilities.

Instead, I will qualitatively estimate the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in computer science based on the provided personality sketch.

Given details in E:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for solving puzzles
- Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Likely matches to these traits for someone in computer science:
1. Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
2. High intelligence suggests capability in a demanding field like computer science.
3. Quiet demeanor can be typical in fields that involve intensive individual work, such as programming or research in computer science.
4. The appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with the rigorous nature of computer science study and research.

Potential mismatches:
- A strong interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn’t directly correlate with traditional computer science, but it doesn’t preclude interest in computational biology or environmental modeling within computer science.

Taking these points into consideration, I would assign a moderate to high posterior probability to the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Therefore, a plausible posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) could be around 0.6.
