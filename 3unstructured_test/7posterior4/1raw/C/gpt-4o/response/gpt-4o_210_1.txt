Applying Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) requires information beyond what is provided in the personality sketch alone. Inference about the specific field like "computer science" typically needs prior probability, likelihood, and marginal likelihood. Since the problem doesn't provide explicit numerical values for priors or likelihood, any answer here would be speculative and not grounded in empirical data.

However, based on the description provided, there are some qualitative aspects that can be discussed. Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might align well with characteristics often found in the field of computer science. Yet, his deep love for animals and nature could suggest fields like biology or environmental science.

To make the educated guess operatively without the precise numerical data:

Using a qualitative approach to reasoning:

1. **Interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts** can increase the likelihood for computer science.
2. **Deep love for animals and nature** might suggest other fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science.

Combining both factors qualitatively without empirical priors:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

Note: The above answer is a reasoned guess in the absence of precise empirical data, representing a moderate probability based on descriptive alignment with computer science characteristics.
