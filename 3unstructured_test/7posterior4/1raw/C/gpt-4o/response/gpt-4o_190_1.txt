To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): This is the initial probability of the hypothesis \( H \), which reflects how likely it is, a priori, that Adam is in the computer science field. Let's assume this to be based on the average proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science. For illustration purposes, let's assume this is \(0.2\) (20%).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): This probability reflects how likely it is to observe the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it might be less indicative of computer science compared to other fields. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) to be \(0.1\) (10%).

3. **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \) and is calculated by considering all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in. This is more complex and would require assumptions about the distributions across all fields. However, for simplicity, we will assume \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant. 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is just a normalizing constant, we focus on the numerator for comparisons:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Normalization is required for the final probability but given only one option presented, the proportional value maintains utility interpretation.

So the final posterior conditional probability could be approximated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.02"
}
```

However, as probabilities must sum-up to 1 over all possible fields of study Adam could be in, additional normalization will be required if multiple fields are considered.
