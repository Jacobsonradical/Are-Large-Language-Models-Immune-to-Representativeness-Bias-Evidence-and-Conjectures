Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since these specific values are not provided, we can only provide a qualitative assessment rather than a precise quantitative one.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we know:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

From these attributes, we can infer:
- Curiosity about nature and plants might suggest a field related to biology, environmental science, or botany rather than computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts could suggest he might do well in computer science, mathematics, or a related field.
- Warmth, empathy, and a love for animals might suggest a field related to life sciences or social sciences.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work can apply to many fields including computer science.

Despite this, without priors and specific likelihoods, we can only make an educated guess about the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.

Given these considerations, the posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This value falls within a reasonable range based on the provided personality sketch, suggesting that while there are elements indicative of a potential fit for computer science, there are also significant attributes that might align with other fields, thus leading to an inferred posterior probability less than 0.5.
