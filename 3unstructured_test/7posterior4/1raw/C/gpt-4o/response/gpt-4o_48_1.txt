Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact value for the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) because determining this requires specific prior probabilities and likelihoods based on detailed statistical data, which are not available. However, I can guide you through the general framework of using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of the evidence \(E\).

Without the specific prior probabilities and likelihood functions, we can't compute the exact posterior. However, we can make a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's personality sketch (\(E\)):
- Genuine curiosity about nature.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence, good with abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Here is a qualitative estimate considering the field of "computer science":

"Computer science" may align with:
- Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and intelligence.
- High capacity for understanding abstract concepts.

On the other hand, aspects such as a deep love for animals and empathy might align less directly with the traditional view of computer science, although interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics or AI for social good do encompass such elements.

Considering these factors, a reasonable qualitative conjecture might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": "approximately 0.6"
}
```

This value isn't exact and is provided for illustrative purposes, reflecting a moderate to high probability based on the alignment of some of Adam's attributes with the field of computer science, while also considering possible divergence due to his strong empathy and love for animals. For a precise figure, detailed statistical information would be necessary.
