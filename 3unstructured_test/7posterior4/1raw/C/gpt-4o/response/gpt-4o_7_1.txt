To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we can use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence (personality sketch).

Here's how we can approximate these components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   This depends on the overall likelihood that a 2021 U.S. graduate student was enrolled in computer science. Suppose, given broad statistics, about 10% of graduate students in the United States are enrolled in computer science.

   \[ P(H) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   We need to assess how likely Adam's personality sketch fits a computer science student. Computer science students are often intelligent and good at solving abstract problems, but being warm-hearted with a deep love for animals and a strong empathy may not be as typical. To simplify, let's estimate the personality match:
   
   \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \]

3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \):**
   This is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which could fit many fields. Assuming students with Adam's personality are not overwhelmingly rare but not ubiquitous:

   \[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, we can apply these values to Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.15.
