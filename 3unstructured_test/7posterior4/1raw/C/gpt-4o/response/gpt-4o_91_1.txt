Bayes' rule allows us to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To use this rule, we need to know:
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the evidence (personality traits of Adam) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, before considering his personality sketch.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing the evidence, considering all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in.

In practice, accurately determining these probabilities requires thorough data and knowledge of various priors and likelihoods, which we might not have. However, we can make educated guesses based on the information given.

1. **P(E|H)**: We assess whether Adam's personality traits align with those commonly associated with students in computer science. Traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles do align well with computer science:
    - It's reasonable to assign a high probability here, let's say \(0.8\).

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
    - If we have no specific information, we might assume the field has an average representation among graduate students. For estimation, letâ€™s say \(P(H) = 0.2\).

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits. This is challenging to estimate directly but can be approximated by considering it across all fields of study:
    - Suppose traits like high intelligence, a love for animals, and a warm heart compared to solving puzzles align across various fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. We could estimate \(P(E) = 0.25\).

Given these estimates, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.16}{0.25} = 0.64 \]

Thus, the computed posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.64.
