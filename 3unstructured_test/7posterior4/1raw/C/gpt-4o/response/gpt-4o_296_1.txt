To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several elements:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given that we don’t have specific numerical values for these probabilities and considering the provided personality sketch, we have to infer these probabilities logically.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for Computer Science**:
   - We lack specific prior data, but generally, let's assume a student could be enrolled in any field with roughly equal probability. 
   - For practical purposes, assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (since there are many possible fields, such as biology, chemistry, physics, etc.).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Considering the personality sketch of Adam (interest in nature, solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and love for animals), the likelihood of Adam being a Computer Science student might not be extremely high compared to fields like biology or environmental science.
   - However, his high intelligence and problem-solving skills are in his favor.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

3. **Total Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is challenging without specific data about the distribution of personality traits across fields. We would need to consider the overall probability of someone in Adam's personality group, which could include various fields.
   - Without exact data, let's estimate \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

Using these estimates:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

This results in:

  "computer science": "0.15"
