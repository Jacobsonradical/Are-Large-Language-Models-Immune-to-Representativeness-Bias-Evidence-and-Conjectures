To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

However, since we do not have explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we will make assumptions based on typical characteristics of fields of study and the provided personality sketch.

Assumptions for Computation:
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability that a graduate student could be in the field of computer science, say \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (i.e., 20%).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence, there is a reasonable match with computer science, but it's not exclusive (e.g., 50%). So, let's set \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
- **Complementary Likelihood \( P(E|\neg H) \)**: For other fields, the compatibility might be less, so let's take an average lower likelihood, say \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
- **Complementary Prior \( P(\neg H) \)**: This is simply the complement of the prior probability, \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.8 \).

Therefore, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the assumed values:

\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.16 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.26 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.26} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3846 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is approximately 0.38.
