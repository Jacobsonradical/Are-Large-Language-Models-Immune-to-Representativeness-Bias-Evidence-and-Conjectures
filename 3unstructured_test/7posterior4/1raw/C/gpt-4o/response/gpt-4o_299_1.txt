To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand that Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact numerical values for the prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)), and the evidence (\( P(E) \)), it's impossible to calculate an exact numeric value. 

Instead, given the qualitative data, we can make an educated guess regarding the field Adam might be enrolled in based on his personality sketch. 

Considering Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These attributes suggest that his interests might be aligned more with fields that require high intellect and appreciation for nature, animals, and solving complex problems, like Biology, Environmental Science, or possibly Psychology. However, since he is also good at understanding abstract concepts, Computer Science cannot be ruled out, especially if we considered interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics.

Given this qualitative analysis and without further specific numerical data, I would consider the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science to be moderate but not high.
