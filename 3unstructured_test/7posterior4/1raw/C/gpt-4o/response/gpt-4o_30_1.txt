To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact numerical posterior probability. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the field of computer science.

### Qualitative Assessment

- **Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This trait might not directly align with a typical interest in computer science.
- **Quiet and Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: This trait is highly relevant for computer science, as problem-solving is a key part of the field.
- **Warm Heart, Strong Empathy, Deep Love for Animals**: These traits are general and don't specifically point towards computer science.
- **High Intelligence and Understanding of Abstract Concepts**: These are important traits for success in computer science.
- **Strong Understanding and Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: These traits are beneficial for any field, including computer science.

Given that Adam's strengths in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with the skills needed in computer science, we can qualitatively estimate a higher posterior probability for enrollment in computer science relative to fields that don't rely on these abilities. 

### Estimates
Thus, a qualitative assessment might suggest a higher probability, but since we need to adhere to the requirement of assigning a value between 0 and 1, let's make an educated guess based on the provided traits.

\[
\text{{"computer science"}}: 0.7
\]

Note: This is a qualitative assessment and should be backed by actual numerical probabilities for a precise calculation.
