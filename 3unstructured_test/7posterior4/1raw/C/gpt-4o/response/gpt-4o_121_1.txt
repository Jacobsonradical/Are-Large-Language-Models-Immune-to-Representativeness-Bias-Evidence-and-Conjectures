To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (before considering \( E \)).
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule states: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we don't have the quantified values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \) explicitly in the problem statement. However, considering common sense and general statistics about graduate students in various fields, we can make some reasonable assumptions and qualitative assessments.

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is a computer science student. Graduate students in computer science often have a good ability to solve puzzles and understand abstract concepts, so this might be reasonably high.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student. This might be moderate since computer science is a popular field.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of Adam having the personality traits described, regardless of his field. This can be considered relatively common among inquisitive and intelligent graduate students.

Since we do not have exact numbers and are making a logical estimation based on the qualitative information given:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

This estimation suggests that there is a moderate to high likelihood that Adam, given his personality and characteristics, could be a computer science graduate student.
