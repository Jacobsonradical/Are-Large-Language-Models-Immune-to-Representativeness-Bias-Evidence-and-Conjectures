To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, without the specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't calculate an exact numerical probability. But we can do a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and the field of computer science.

**Personality Sketch Analysis (E):**
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Field Hypothesis (H):** Computer Science

1. **P(E|H)**: This would represent the probability of Adam having the given personality traits (E) if he is in computer science. 
   - Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strongly aligned with computer science.
   - High intelligence is also a positive indicator.
   - However, a strong empathy and a deep love for animals might not be direct indicators for computer science but do not exclude it either.

2. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being in computer science before considering the personality sketch.
   - Given the high number of students enrolled in computer science in the U.S., especially graduate students, this could be moderately high.

3. **P(E)**: This is the total probability of the personality sketch irrespective of the field. It would require accounting for all fields and their respective probabilities of having such a personality. Without precise data, this is hard to quantify but would include contributions from various fields like biology, environmental science, and psychology.

Given the qualitative assessment and the alignment of some key traits with computer science, we can hypothesize that:

\[
P(H|E) \text{ is moderately high.}
\]

So based on this qualitative assessment, I would propose a likelihood within the range of educated guesswork recognizing the alignment between solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and high intelligence with computer science.

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.7
\}
\]

This is a subjective guess considering the traits relevant to success in computer science and the context provided. Note that a more precise answer would require actual probabilistic data.
