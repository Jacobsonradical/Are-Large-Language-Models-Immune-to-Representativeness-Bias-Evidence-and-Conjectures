To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more specific information about the prior probabilities and likelihood functions, which are not provided in the problem statement. However, to provide a plausible estimate based on the personality sketch of Adam, we can consider the characteristics that align with fields of study.

Given Adamâ€™s traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy.
- Love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align well with fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, and potentially computer science, especially if we consider computational biology, bioinformatics, or artificial intelligence focusing on environmental or animal-related problems.

However, in the absence of actual data and to follow the requested format, an educated guess on the posterior conditional probability can be provided as:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

This estimation acknowledges the possibility that Adam's skills and personality could be useful in computer science, though perhaps not as directly aligned as certain other fields such as biology or environmental science.
