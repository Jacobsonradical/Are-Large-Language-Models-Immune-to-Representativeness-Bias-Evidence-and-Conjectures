To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's what each term represents:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only provide a subjective estimate based on the description.

Adam's personality sketch highlights his genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science rather than computer science. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts do fit well with computer science.

Given these considerations, let's estimate these probabilities qualitatively:
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood): Itâ€™s moderate, as some of Adam's traits fit well with computer science, while others do not.
- \( P(H) \) (prior): This will depend on general enrollment statistics, but since computer science is a common field, let's assume a moderate prior.
- \( P(E) \) (marginal likelihood): This is the probability of Adam having his personality traits in general, across all fields. Given no specific biases, we assume this is sufficiently broad.

Considering these points, we provide a subjective estimate for \( P(H|E) \):
