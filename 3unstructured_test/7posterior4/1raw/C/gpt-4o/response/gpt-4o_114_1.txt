To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Based on the personality sketch given about Adam and referencing the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a field like computer science:

1. **Likelihood \( (P(E|H)) \):** This is the probability that a person in computer science would have characteristics like a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, a warm heart, strong empathy, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work.

   - Considering computer science students often exhibit characteristics such as high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) would be fairly high, though characteristics like a deep love for animals and empathy might not be as commonly associated specifically with computer science.

2. **Prior Probability \( (P(H)) \):** This represents the proportion of graduate students in computer science out of the total number of graduate students.
   
   - We might assume that the proportion of students in computer science among all graduate fields is moderate, representing a common field but not the most dominant.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( (P(E)) \):** This is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \) across all fields.
   
   - Given the diverse fields of graduate study, \( P(E) \) would be considered with the understanding that traits like curiosity about nature and empathy are moderately distributed across fields.

Given these points, while exact values require concrete data, we can make an educated guess to estimate \( P(H_{cs}|E) \).

Given the information and typical traits associated with graduate students in computer science:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.3 \]
