To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This represents the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This represents the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) overall, across all possible fields.

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - This is the probability we want to compute, which reflects the updated belief given the evidence.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we lack detailed numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, let's make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is a popular field, but possibly less likely for someone primarily interested in nature, plants, and animals.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits of curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving are quite compatible with computer science. However, the specific interest in nature and animals might make it less likely compared to other fields more directly related to biology or environmental science.
   
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is trickier without knowing the base rates of these personality traits across all graduate fields. However, it includes the compatibility of Adamâ€™s traits with fields other than computer science.

Given the qualitative nature, let's provide a reasoned estimate. We might say it is less than the likelihood for fields like biology or environmental science but not entirely unlikely.

Estimation:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \]

Hence our answer is:
