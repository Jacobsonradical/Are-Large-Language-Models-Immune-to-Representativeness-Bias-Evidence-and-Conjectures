To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need several pieces of information:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. The overall probability \( P(E) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make an estimation given the traits described in the personality sketch.

Traits like "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" might be more strongly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, or a related natural science discipline. On the other hand, Adam is described as intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, which could be indicative of a fit for computer science or a related technical field. The appreciation for hard work and dedication could be considered neutral across many fields.

Given these considerations, it's plausible that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, but based on the personality sketch alone, it might not be the highest probability.

With these subjective estimates:

- Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.1 \) given that there are many possible fields.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) given the mixed indicators might be moderate, say \( 0.4 \).

Given that these are purely subjective estimations and without specific values:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4 \]

Thus, the estimation:

  "computer science": 0.4
