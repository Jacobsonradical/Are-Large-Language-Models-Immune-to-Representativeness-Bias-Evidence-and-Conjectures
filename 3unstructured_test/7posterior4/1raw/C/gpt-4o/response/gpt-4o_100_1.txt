To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we should ideally have the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science as well as the likelihood of having his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Without concrete data, we can only estimate based on the given traits and how they align with typical characteristics of students in computer science.

However, I'll give a qualitative estimate considering the provided information about Adam's interests, skills, and personality.

Bayes' rule formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given E (Adam's personality traits) and H (Adam was enrolled in computer science), we consider the following:

- For \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Since he is a graduate student in the U.S., and computer science is a common field, a reasonable prior might be moderate. For example, 0.2 (20%).
- For \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given traits if he is enrolled in computer science.
  - High intelligence and good at abstract concepts are highly aligned with computer science students.
  - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits well.
  - Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals are not specifically aligned with computer science but do not contradict it either.
  
  Let's assume a likelihood of 0.7.
- For \( P(E) \): The general probability of having Adam's traits in the general population of graduate students. This is challenging to estimate, but it would be a mix of all fields. A moderate to high probability can be assumed, say 0.5.

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.14}{0.5} = 0.28 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
