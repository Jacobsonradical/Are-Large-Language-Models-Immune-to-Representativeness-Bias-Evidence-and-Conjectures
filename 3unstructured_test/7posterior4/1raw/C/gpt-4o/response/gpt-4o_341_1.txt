To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, we can make some qualitative assessments based on the description provided.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (that Adam was enrolled in computer science) given the evidence (personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given that Adam has traits of being highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, these qualities align well with someone who might study computer science. On the other hand, his love for nature, plants, and animals might also suggest other fields like biology or environmental science.

Without additional concrete numerical data, and based on qualitative assessment:

\[ P(E| \text{computer science}) \] might be relatively high because traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles are common in computer science students.
\[ P(\text{computer science}) \] would be the general prior probability of anyone being a computer science student.

Assuming no information about the base rates and equal priors among various fields, we can hypothesize:

{
  "computer science": "0.3 to 0.5"
}

This range indicates a moderate probability based on the traits described, acknowledging the uncertainty and the influence of other fields that could also be relevant.
