To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to rewrite Bayes' rule in terms of the given variables as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given E (the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

To compute this, we need reasonable estimates for these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science programs in a typical U.S. university is around 10% (0.1). This is a rough estimate but serves as a starting point.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the details in the personality sketch, we evaluate how well it fits a typical computer science student. While computer science students can be of various personalities, the traits listed (curiosity, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and problem-solving) are generally congruent with the skills needed for computer science. Let's estimate a moderate-high likelihood of 0.6.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch regardless of the field of study. Given that Adam's traits are somewhat common and can fit multiple fields, let's estimate this probability to be 0.3.

Using these estimates, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.3} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.2.
