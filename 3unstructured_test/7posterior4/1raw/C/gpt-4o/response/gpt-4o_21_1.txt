To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to properly compute this, we would ideally require specific probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Given that the exact numerical values for these probabilities are not provided, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the typical likelihood of different fields fitting the given personality sketch.

1. **P(E|H)**: Probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   - Computer science students may have a genuine curiosity about problem-solving (in line with solving puzzles), high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, aspects like a deep love for animals and warm-heartedness might be less specific to computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) may be moderate.
   
2. **P(H)**: Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   - Let's correlate this with national averages. Assume that there's a certain proportion of graduate students enrolled in computer science.
   
3. **P(E)**: Overall probability of the personality sketch.
   - This would be the total probability of seeing the personality traits described in any field.

Since actual numerical values for these probabilities are not given, we'll make an educated estimate based on the traits and known population distributions.

Let's assume the following reasonable estimates:
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \): Moderate correlation since some traits fit well with computer science, but not all.
- \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \): Estimates based on the popularity of computer science in graduate programs.
- \( P(E) \approx 0.2 \): Assumption of the overall occurrence of the personality sketch across various fields.

Using these estimates:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality traits, is:
