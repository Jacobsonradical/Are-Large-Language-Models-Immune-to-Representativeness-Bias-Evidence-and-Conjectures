To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Unfortunately, these values are not provided directly in the problem, which makes it impossible to compute an exact value for \( P(H|E) \).

However, I can give a qualitative assessment based on the description provided in the personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The likelihood of any given field being computer science generally among graduate students.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability that Adam, given his characteristics, would be in the computer science field.
3. **Evidence (P(E))**: The overall probability of a student having a personality sketch like Adam's across all fields.

Given the following points from the sketch:
- Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Computer science students often have traits related to intelligence and solving puzzles, which fits well with Adam's characteristics. However, his strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals may indicate a field related to biology or environmental science rather than computer science.

Considering both congruent and incongruent traits with the field of computer science, I would estimate the posterior conditional probability as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value reflects that while some aspects of Adam's personality align with the field of computer science, other aspects do not, leading to a moderate likelihood.
