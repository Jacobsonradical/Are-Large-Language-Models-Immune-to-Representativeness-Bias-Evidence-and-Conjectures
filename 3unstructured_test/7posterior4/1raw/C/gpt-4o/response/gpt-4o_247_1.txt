Given the request, it appears you would like a posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science and \( E \) is his personality sketch. To compute this using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the evidence \( E \) given \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): Probability of the evidence \( E \) across all hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the actual numerical values of these probabilities, we can estimate based on interpretations:

- \( P(E|H) \): Probability that Adam's personality sketch aligns with him being in computer science. Given Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this probability is likely to be high.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that he is enrolled in computer science. Considering the popularity of the field, this probability might be moderate.
- \( P(E) \): Probability of observing such a personality sketch irrespective of the field. This is the normalization factor and ensures probabilities sum to 1.

Given the information, we estimate:
- \( P(E|H) \) to be high (around 0.7 to 0.9)
- \( P(H) \) to be moderate (around 0.2 to 0.3)
- \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor; exact value unknown but should ensure final result makes sense.

Without specific data, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the above:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This reflects a reasonably high posterior probability that given Adam's personality traits and his background, he could be enrolled in computer science.
