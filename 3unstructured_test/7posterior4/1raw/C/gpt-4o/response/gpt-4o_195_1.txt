To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we'd use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're not given specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \) in this scenario, we must make a qualitative assessment based on the sketch provided.

Given the sketch, Adam is described as someone who:
- Has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Has strong empathy and a deep love for animals
- Possesses a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These characteristics suggest that Adam might lean towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps a field related to natural sciences. Computer science, while it can align with high intelligence and solving puzzles, does not immediately align with his strong empathy and love for animals.

Thus, quantitatively assessing based on these qualitative insights, we might conclude:

{
  "computer science": 0.2
}

This suggests a lower probability given our understanding of his personality and interests from the sketch.
