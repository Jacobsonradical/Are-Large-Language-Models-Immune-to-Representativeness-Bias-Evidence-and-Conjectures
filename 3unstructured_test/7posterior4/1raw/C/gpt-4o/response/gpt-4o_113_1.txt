To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since we don't have concrete numerical values for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative reasoning-based estimate instead.

Given Adam's personality sketch (E), here are some elements to consider:
- Enjoys solving puzzles (aligns with problem-solving skills in computer science).
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (aligns well with computer science).
- Genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals (less directly related to computer science but doesn't preclude interest in it).

Based on these observations, we can infer that it is reasonably likely Adam could be enrolled in computer science, even though his interests in nature and animals might suggest a field like biology or environmental science.

Therefore, based on qualitative reasoning, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for computer science is:
