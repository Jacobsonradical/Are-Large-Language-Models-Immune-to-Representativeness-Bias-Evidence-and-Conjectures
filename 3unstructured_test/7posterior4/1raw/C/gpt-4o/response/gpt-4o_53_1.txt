To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, the problem statement does not provide specific numerical values for these terms, making it impossible to compute an exact value for the posterior conditional probability without making assumptions.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that "Adam was enrolled in computer science."
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

For the hypothesis regarding the field of computer science, we consider the following:
- Computer science students often have high intelligence and are good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adam's traits.
- However, Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and empathy do not directly correlate with typical characteristics or activities in a computer science program.

Given this qualitative analysis and considering that we don't have exact numerical values, we can hypothesize that Adam's likelihood of being in computer science is lower compared to fields more closely related to his interests and personality traits such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Based on the qualitative assessment, I'll estimate the probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This estimate reflects a lower probability compared to other fields that might better match Adam's described personality and interests.
