To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of his field of study.

Given the problem does not provide specific numerical values for the priors or likelihoods, we need to make educated guesses and use qualitative reasoning based on the information provided.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \)**:
   - Computer science students can vary widely in their characteristics, but some attributes in Adam’s personality sketch (high intelligence, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts) align well with common traits of computer science students.
   - Therefore, \( P(E \mid H) \) is moderately high.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Without specific data on the distribution of students' fields, let's assume the probability is uniform across various fields.
   - Therefore, \( P(H) \) might be taken as a moderate value, representing no special bias toward computer science.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This needs to be computed considering all possible fields of study. We don't have concrete numbers, but since Adam's characteristics are somewhat general, \( P(E) \) would not be exceedingly rare.

Based on qualitative assessment:

1. \( P(E \mid H) \): Moderately high
2. \( P(H) \): Average or typical (e.g., around 0.1 considering multiple fields)
3. \( P(E) \): Not overly rare, but not too common either

### Estimation:

Given the above reasoning, \( P(H \mid E) \) won’t be near 0 but likely not extremely high either because while Adam's traits align with computer science, they aren’t exclusive to it.

Based on qualitative parameters, we might reasonably estimate:

\[
\boxed{"computer science": "0.4"}
\]

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
