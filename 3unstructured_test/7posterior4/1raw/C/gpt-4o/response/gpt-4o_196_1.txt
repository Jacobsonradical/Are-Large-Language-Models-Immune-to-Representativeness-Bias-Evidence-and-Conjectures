To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Unfortunately, without specific data for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability \( P(E) \), we cannot compute the exact value quantitatively. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided information.

### Qualitative Assessment:
- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interests, it is less likely for him to be in computer science due to his strong inclination towards nature, empathy, animals, and solving puzzles which may align more with fields like biology or environmental sciences rather than computer science.
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science depends on the enrollment distribution of graduate students across different fields, but let's assume a neutral stance without specific data.

Given the qualitative assessment based on his personality sketch not matching typical traits directly linked to computer science (though there are instances of intersection like AI in biology), and lacking quantitative data, we assign a low probability interval.

If specific data were available, this probability could be refined further.
