To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to define the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and also formulate \( P(E) \). However, the problem statement does not provide these exact probabilities. For a realistic calculation, specific values for these components should be known.

Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information we have, a qualitative assessment rather than a precise numerical evaluation can be provided based on the personality sketch attributes and their relevance to the field of computer science.

1. High intelligence
2. Good at understanding abstract concepts
3. Enjoys solving puzzles

All these traits align well with the requirements for studying computer science. Therefore, we might reason that the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science is fairly high. However, assigning it a precise numerical probability without actual data is speculative.

In absence of concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods, I will provide a reasoned estimate.

Please note that this is an approximate value based on qualitative analysis and not a derived statistical measure due to the lack of specific data.
