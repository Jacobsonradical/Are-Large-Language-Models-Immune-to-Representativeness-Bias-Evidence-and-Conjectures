To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before we consider the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch E across all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the exact numerical values for these probabilities are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, it's not possible to compute a specific numerical answer without making some reasonable assumptions or having additional data. 

Given Adam's traits — a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, quiet demeanor, enjoyment of puzzles, warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work — it intuitively seems less likely (but not impossible) for him to be enrolled in computer science compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Without specific priors and likeliness, we would qualitatively estimate the probability based on the fact patterns provided. Computer science often attracts individuals with high intelligence and strong abstract thinking, which are fitting traits for Adam. However, his specific interest in nature, plants, and animals might weigh against it.

Assuming we need to make an estimation in the absence of hard data, a reasonable guess might be as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This estimate reflects that while it's feasible for Adam to be in computer science due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving interest, his other traits somewhat lower this likelihood relative to fields more directly aligned with his nature and animal interests.
