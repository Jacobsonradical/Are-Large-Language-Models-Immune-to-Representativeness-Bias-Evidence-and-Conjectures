To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginalized probability of the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields of study.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), letâ€™s make qualitative assessments:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, which suggests interests more aligned with biology, botany, or environmental science rather than computer science.
- A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles suggests some alignment with computer science due to problem-solving skills.
- Strong empathy and love for animals suggest alignment with fields like veterinary medicine, zoology, or animal sciences.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication applies to many fields, including computer science.

Given these observations, we would qualitatively estimate \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).

However, without specific numeric values or detailed statistical data about the distribution of such traits across different fields, it is difficult to provide an exact posterior probability. Assuming some reasonable estimates based on typical prevalence:

- Assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science) = 0.2 (assuming an even distribution among multiple possible fields like biology, botany, veterinary science, etc.).
- Assume \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood given computer science) = 0.5 (since some traits align well, but others suggest different fields).
- Assume \( P(E) \) = 1 (normalization factor across all possible fields).

With these qualitative estimates, we can roughly calculate:

\[ P(H|E) =  \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{1} = 0.1 \]

Given the nature of this problem and qualitative assessments, be aware that this value is highly dependent on our assumptions.
