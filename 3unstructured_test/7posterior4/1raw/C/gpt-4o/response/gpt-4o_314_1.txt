To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior probability (P(H))**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of Computer Science before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
3. **Evidence (P(E))**: The overall probability of observing the evidence (sum of the weighted likelihoods for all possible hypotheses).

Bayes' rule can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll make theoretical estimates based on the given information and compute the probability in an approximate, qualitative manner.

### Prior Probability, P(H):
Let's assume there is a reasonable distribution of graduate students in various fields, given Adam's characteristics. However, this does not provide a specific prior probability. To simplify, we might assume that fields like Computer Science, Biology, and other sciences are equally likely. For the sake of demonstration, let's assume \( P(H) \) is 0.1 (indicating a 10% prior likelihood for each of 10 equally likely fields Adam could be enrolled in).

### Likelihood, P(E|H):
Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles (which might be high in computer science)
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (valuable in computer science)
- Empathy and love for animals (less directly related to computer science)

While some characteristics fit well with computer science (solving puzzles, intelligence, abstract concepts), others like love for nature and empathy for animals might not be directly related.

Thus, P(E|H) might be moderately high. Let's assume qualitatively \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).

### Evidence, P(E):
This should be the total probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields and can be treated as a normalization factor. We can assume it sums up to 1 across the 10 fields in simplified calculations.

Given the assumptions:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.1}{1} = 0.05 \]

Finally, presenting in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.05"
}
```

This value is an estimate and relies on the theoretical approach since exact probabilities and exhaustive field categorization are not available.
