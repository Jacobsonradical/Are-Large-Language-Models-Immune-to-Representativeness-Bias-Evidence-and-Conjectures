In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science (P(H)), the likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)), and the overall probability of E (P(E)). However, since the problem does not provide specific values for these probabilities, we cannot calculate a precise numerical value. 

Instead, I can give a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch.

Adam's personality sketch shows he is intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has empathy and a passion for nature and animals. While these characteristics could fit someone in computer science, they are not exclusively suggestive of it. 

Given this, we might qualitatively assess that Adam's personality aligns with several fields, not particularly favoring computer science over other fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, which also involve puzzle-solving and abstract thinking.

Since we need a value between 0 and 1:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value reflects a conservative estimate without more specific data, acknowledging the possibility but not asserting strong confidence in computer science as Adam's field based on the given information.
