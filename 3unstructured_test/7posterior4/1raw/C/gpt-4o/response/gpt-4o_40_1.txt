To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities, the likelihood, and the evidence. Specifically, Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this scenario, we do not have specific values for the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), or the evidence \(P(E)\). 

Given that we have to provide a value between 0 and 1 and can't compute the exact values due to the lack of specific numerical data, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

Adam's personality sketch emphasizes a strong curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and high intelligence, which are traits that could align with a computer science field. However, his warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might make him more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or even psychology. 

Given this balance, we might reasonably estimate the probability for computer science as notably plausible but not exceedingly high, since there are other fields where Adam's traits seem even more fitting.

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.4
\]

Thus, we can present the probability as:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
