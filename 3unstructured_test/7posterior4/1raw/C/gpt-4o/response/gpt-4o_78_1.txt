To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have information on:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) (Adam's characteristics) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided in the question.

Without specific probabilities, we can only make a qualitative assessment. Given Adam's characteristics:

- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align with computer science.
- However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature's plants might suggest a field related to biology, environmental science, or a similar nature-oriented discipline.

Considering these points qualitatively, we can estimate that while computer science is a possibility, it may not be the most likely choice given his other strong interests. For the sake of an estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This represents an educated guess rather than a precise computation, emphasizing that while possible, it is not the most probable field given the provided personality sketch.
