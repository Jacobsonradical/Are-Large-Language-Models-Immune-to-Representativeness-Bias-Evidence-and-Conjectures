To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider four key components:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science before considering his personality traits.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.
4. **Posterior probability** \( P(H|E) \): The probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality traits.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical values, determining exact probabilities requires reasonable assumptions based on qualitative analysis:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \):
   The likelihood of Adam being a computer science student can be based on general enrollment statistics in a graduate program. Let's assume a prior probability \( P(H) \) of 0.15 (15%), reflecting a moderate likelihood considering the popularity of computer science.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, love for puzzles, and appreciation for dedication, these traits are somewhat fitting for a computer science student. Let's assume a likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of 0.7 (70%).

3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \):
   The evidence encompasses the probability of observing Adam's traits across all fields of study. While this is harder to quantify without specific data, we can estimate it based on the idea that such traits are relatively common across a range of disciplines. Let's give it a moderate value of 0.2 (20%).

Using these values, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.105}{0.2} = 0.525 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.525.
