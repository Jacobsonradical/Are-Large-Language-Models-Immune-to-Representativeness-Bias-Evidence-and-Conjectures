To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate several probabilities. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Unfortunately, without specific numerical values, it's challenging to compute an exact numerical probability. However, we can qualitatively discuss the likelihood and provide an estimated value based on the characteristics described in the personality sketch.

Given the sketch of Adam:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
3. He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
5. He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

For the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, here's the consideration:
- Curiosity about nature could correlate with interests in data analysis or bioinformatics within computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the skills needed in computer science.
- While empathy and a love for animals might be less directly related, interdisciplinary fields like artificial intelligence (AI) concerning animal behavior or environmental modeling could still be relevant.
- Graduate students in the U.S. often pursue computer science due to its broad applications and high demand.

Based on these qualitative considerations, it is reasonable to assign a moderate probability to Adam being in computer science. 

Hence, a reasonable estimated value might be:
