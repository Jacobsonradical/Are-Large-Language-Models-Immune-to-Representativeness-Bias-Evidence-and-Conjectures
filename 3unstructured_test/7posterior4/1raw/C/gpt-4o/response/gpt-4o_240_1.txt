To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering any evidence.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can provide an educated estimation based on the context provided.

Based on Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits could fit well with a number of fields, including computer science, but more strongly suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine, given the emphasis on nature, plants, and animals. However, given the high intelligence and skill in abstract concepts, computer science could still be a plausible field.

Assuming equal priors (i.e., before considering the evidence, we assume he is equally likely to be in any field), and given the traits, we might estimate the likelihoods as follows:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Let's denote:

- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \), assuming a somewhat typical prior distribution of students across various fields.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \), since Adam's skills in abstract concepts and puzzle-solving fit computer science, but his interests in nature and animals are less typical.
- \( P(E) \approx 0.5 \), aggregating the likelihoods across various relevant fields (biology, environmental science, veterinary medicine, computer science, etc.).

Using these rough estimates:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.06}{0.5} = 0.12 \]

So, the estimated posterior conditional probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.12.
