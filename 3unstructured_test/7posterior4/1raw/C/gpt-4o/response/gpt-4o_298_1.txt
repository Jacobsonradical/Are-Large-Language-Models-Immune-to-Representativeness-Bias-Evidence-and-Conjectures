To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to accurately compute this, we need information about:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, regardless of his field.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide an exact numerical value. But we can make educated assumptions based on common stereotypes and general knowledge about fields and personalities.

1. **P(E|H),** the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in computer science: We know that Adam has traits like high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are commonly associated with computer science students. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.

2. **P(H),** the prior probability of being a computer science student: Computer science is a popular graduate field, but other fields are also common. For simplicity, we might assume \( P(H) \) is moderate.

3. **P(E),** the probability of Adam’s personality sketch: This is more complex as it involves considering all possible fields. Since Adam’s characteristics aren't exclusive to computer science but are quite well-suited for it, \( P(E) \) is not overwhelmingly high but not too low either.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's approximate the probabilities:

- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E) \) can be estimated loosely based on his traits appearing similarly in other fields, hence let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \).

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.7) * (0.2)}{0.4} = \frac{0.14}{0.4} = 0.35 \]

Approximating the value:
