To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

However, to compute this exactly, we need specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), which are not provided in the problem statement. Still, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information provided.

Given Adam's attributes: curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, warmth and empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—here’s an assessment for computer science:

1. **Curiosity About Nature & Plants**: Neutral or irrelevant to computer science.
2. **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: Strongly relevant to computer science.
3. **Warm Heart and Empathy**: Neutral or less relevant to computer science.
4. **Love for Animals**: Neutral or irrelevant to computer science.
5. **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts**: Strongly relevant to computer science.
6. **Appreciation for Hard Work**: General positive trait but specifically less indicative.

Given these points, it would be reasonable to estimate a moderate to high probability that Adam might be enrolled in computer science, primarily driven by his interest in puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts.

Here's the qualitative posterior probability score:
