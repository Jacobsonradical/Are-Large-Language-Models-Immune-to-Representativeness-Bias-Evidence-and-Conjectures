To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we first need to rewrite Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To make this calculation, we need the following pieces of information:

1. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing the evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \) - the probability of observing the evidence E under all possible fields Adam could be enrolled in (the normalization constant).

However, without specific numerical values to use for these probabilities, we can only make qualitative estimates based on the description given.

### Estimating Probabilities:
Given Adam's personality sketch:
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are all traits that correlate well with computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively high. However, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals is less directly associated with computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is—randomly speaking—enrolled in computer science can be considered somewhat high considering it is a common graduate field, but we do not have specific base rates.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence E considering all possible fields Adam could be in. Fields like biology, environmental science, or similar disciplines might fit the description better, making \( P(E) \) higher if those fields are considered.

Since the exact numerical values are required for a precise calculation, let's consider an informed estimate based on these qualitative considerations. Given Adam's alignment with many traits suitable for computer science but also his affinity for nature, a balanced estimate might be reasonable.

### Estimated Probability:
While understanding that an exact posterior probability isn't possible with qualitative data alone, an educated estimate could place the hypothesis \( H \) on the lower-to-middle range because computer science fits some, but not all, of Adam's described traits. 

Let's assign a reasonable probabilistic estimate considering the above discussion:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
``` 

This value reflects that Adam could potentially fit into a computer science field but there are significant aspects of his personality that might make him more inclined towards other fields related to nature and animals.
