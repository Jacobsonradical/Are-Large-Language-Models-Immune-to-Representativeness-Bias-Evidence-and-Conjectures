To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the basic framework of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \), which can be computed by summing over all possible fields Adam might be enrolled in.

However, calculating exact probabilities requires specific data about the distribution of students in various fields, the tendencies of students in those fields to exhibit characteristics like Adam's, and other contextual information. In the absence of precise data, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided characteristics of Adam and how well they match the profile of a computer science student.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, is intelligent with an understanding of abstract concepts, and has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, we can qualitatively infer how likely he is to be in the field of computer science.

Computer science students often have strong problem-solving skills, a high level of intelligence, enjoy abstract concepts, and appreciate hard work and dedication. However, the specific interest in nature and plants is less directly connected to computer science.

Given this, I'll assign a plausible subjective probability based on the match between Adam's characteristics and the typical profile of a computer science student:

\[ P(H|E) = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability is:
