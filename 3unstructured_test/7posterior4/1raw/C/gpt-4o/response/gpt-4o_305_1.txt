To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Given that we do not have the exact values for these probabilities, I’ll make informed estimations based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Adam’s interests and traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence in abstract concepts might suggest a lower likelihood for a computer science graduate compared to other fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence might provide a reasonable match to computer science.

It is difficult to provide an accurate numerical value without proper data, but we can provide an estimated probability based on the traits provided.

Based on these considerations, I provide the following estimated value:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This value reflects a moderate probability that, despite his strong fit for natural sciences and psychology, Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence could also have led him to study computer science.
