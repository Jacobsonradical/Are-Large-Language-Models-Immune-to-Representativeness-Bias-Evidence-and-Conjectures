To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require prior probabilities and likelihoods for each hypothesis. However, since these values are not provided, I will illustrate the structure and the approach rather than providing an exact numerical answer. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

For the given field of computer science, let's denote it as \( H_{\text{CS}} \).

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
\]

To make an informed assessment with hypothetical numbers:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Assume a prior probability that Adam could be in the computer science field (this is challenging without more context, but let’s hypothetically set it to 0.1 for simplicity).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's traits such as intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with characteristics beneficial for computer science, let's set the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) at a higher rate, e.g., 0.7.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the probability of the evidence \( E \). It's difficult to calculate directly without a comprehensive set of potential fields Adam might be in, so let’s assume, hypothetically, it to be 0.2 based on an average distribution of interest fields among graduate students.

Using these hypothetical values:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35
\]

Thus, with the hypothetical values, the posterior conditional probability can be calculated as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.35"
}

Remember, the actual values could be significantly different with accurate prior probabilities and likelihoods.
