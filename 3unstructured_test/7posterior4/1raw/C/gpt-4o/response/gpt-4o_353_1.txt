To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know additional information such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science, and the overall probability of observing such a personality sketch in the entire student population. However, we can provide a heuristic analysis based on the provided information.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \):
- Interested in nature and plants.
- Quiet, enjoys puzzles.
- Empathetic, loves animals.
- High intelligence, good with abstract concepts.
- Values hard work and dedication.

Let's analyze the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's traits match a typical Computer Science student:
- Interest in solving puzzles and abstract thinking: High likelihood (many CS students enjoy these)
- Quiet and high intelligence: Moderately high likelihood
- Genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals: These traits are less specific to computer science but do not contradict it.

Without concrete statistical data, we can hypothesize a reasonable heuristic value. Considering that Computer Science students can exhibit a wide range of personalities and interests, we might assign a conditional probability leaning towards moderate likelihood. 

Thus, an estimated value is:

{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
