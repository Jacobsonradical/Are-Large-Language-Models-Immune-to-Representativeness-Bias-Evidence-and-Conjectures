To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \(E\)), we need to apply Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \(E\) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E)\), we can only provide a qualitative assessment or an estimate based on the match between Adam's traits and the field of computer science.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are traits that align well with computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, which is also a common trait among individuals interested in computer science.
- However, Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals may not be directly related to computer science, but they do not preclude it either.

Given these considerations, if we assume an arbitrary prior distribution with equal likelihood among various possible fields of study, the lack of explicit mention of his direct engagement with technology or computing slightly diminishes the likelihood, but not extensively.

Based on this qualitative assessment, a reasonable estimate for \(P(H|E)\) might be:
