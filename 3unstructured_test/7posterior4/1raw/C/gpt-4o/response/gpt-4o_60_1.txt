To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need:

1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. **P(E)**: The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we can provide a heuristic estimate for the given field.

1. **P(E|H)**: Estimating the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is a computer science graduate student.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns with algorithmic and problem-solving aspects of computer science.
   - However, a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature's plants might not be as strongly associated.
   
   Let's assign a heuristic value:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being a computer science graduate student. This would be based on the general proportion of graduate students in computer science.
   - This value can vary greatly. Let's assume:
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (since graduate students are spread among many fields, computer science might be reasonably common)

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits among all graduate students.
   - This is harder to determine without specific data, but assuming these traits are somewhat rare to have all together.
   - Let's assign a value:
   - \( P(E) \approx 0.05 \)

Plugging in these heuristic values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.05} = \frac{0.07}{0.05} \approx 1.4 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, if this exceeds 1, it means our heuristics overestimated, and thus we can normalize it back to 1.

Given how heuristics work and tending to normalization and conservative estimates, a more natural estimate would then be closer to:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \]

Thus, the answer is:
