To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to rely on Bayes' theorem, which states: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) (i.e., we do not have the quantitative data needed to perform the exact computation), we have to make an educated guess based on the provided personality sketch and the field of study.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits do not specifically align with computer science but rather blend well with multiple fields, such as biology, environmental science, and psychology, apart from computer science. Therefore, without precise numerical data, we can only provide a rough qualitative assessment.

Assigning a probabilistic estimate that reflects moderate relevance to computer science considering his traits:

{
  "computer science": "Approximately 0.3 to 0.4"
}

This estimate accounts for the possibility that while Adam's puzzle-solving and high intelligence might suit computer science, his other traits suggest a stronger inclination towards nature-related or empathetically demanding fields.
