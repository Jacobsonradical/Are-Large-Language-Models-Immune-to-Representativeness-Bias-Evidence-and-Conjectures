To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability P(H) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, the likelihood P(E|H) that Adam's personality sketch E would occur if he were studying computer science, and the overall probability P(E) of the personality sketch E.

Bayes' Rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we don't have the exact values for P(H), P(E|H), or P(E) provided in the problem and would need to estimate these values based on the information given.

Given that Adam is described as having "a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "a deep love for animals," it's less likely that his field of study is computer science. However, he also has a "high intelligence" and "is good at understanding abstract concepts," which could be associated with computer science.

While we can make educated guesses, without specific numerical values, any probability provided would be speculative.

Nevertheless, based on the qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This value suggests a lower probability, recognizing that the personality traits strongly lean towards fields like biology, ecology, or environmental science, but still acknowledging that his intelligence and abstract reasoning skills might also fit within computer science, though less prominently.
