To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following:

Bayes' Rule Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H (Adam being enrolled in computer science).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence E.

Unfortunately, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot provide an exact numerical value for this probability. However, we can reason about the probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

Considering his traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals -> more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology.
- Enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence -> could also fit computer science.
- Warm heart and strong empathy -> slightly suggests fields involving interaction with others or caring professions.

Given these considerations, let's make an informed estimation based on qualitative reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students, we might assign a reasonable probability to it, let's say 0.3 (30%).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits, computer science is somewhat consistent with his skills and quiet nature, perhaps a likelihood of 0.4 (40%).

3. **Total Probability, \( P(E) \)**: This represents the total probability of meeting someone with Adam's personality traits across all fields. Given the diverse range of relevant fields, let's assign it a value of 1 (as we're considering the overall context).

Combining these estimated values to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{1} = 0.12 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) can be estimated as:
