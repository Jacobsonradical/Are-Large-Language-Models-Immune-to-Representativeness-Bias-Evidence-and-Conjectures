To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing the evidence.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete prior probabilities and the likelihoods, we're unable to calculate an exact numerical value. But we can qualitatively reason about the probabilities.

1. ** \( P(E|H) \) **: Given Adam's personality traits:
    - Love for solving puzzles (a potential match for computer science).
    - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (strong indicators for success in computer science).
    - Curiosity about nature and plants, which is less common in computer science graduates, but not impossible.

2. ** \( P(H) \) **: Prior probability of Adam being a computer science student. Depending on the institution and its departments, let's assume it's moderately likely, but we don't have a concrete value.

3. ** \( P(E) \) **: The prior probability of observing someone with Adam's traits in the general graduate student population, which includes multiple fields.

Combining these qualitative aspects, we can estimate the posterior.

Due to the match in problem-solving skills and intelligence with the field of computer science, but considering his strong interests in nature and animals which are less common in computer science, we might give a moderate probability.

Given these considerations, we can tentatively estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

Keep in mind this is a qualitative guess, and actual computation would require numerical priors and likelihoods.
