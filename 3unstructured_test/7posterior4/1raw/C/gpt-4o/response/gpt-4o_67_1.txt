To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true before seeing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given the information provided:
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact numerical value. However, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood.

Consider Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits suggest that Adam could be well-suited for a variety of fields that require intelligence, abstract thinking, and possibly working with nature or animals. While computer science does require high intelligence and abstract thinking, it may not align as well with his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants compared to fields such as biology, environmental science, or veterinary science.

Thus, while it's not impossible that Adam was enrolled in computer science, his personality sketch suggests other fields could be a better fit. We would assign a moderate-to-lower likelihood relative to other fields more aligned with his interests and traits.

Assuming equal priors and likelihoods for simplicity:
