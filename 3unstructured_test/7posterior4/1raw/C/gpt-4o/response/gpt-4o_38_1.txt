To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the field of computer science using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formulation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this specific example, let's break down the components:

- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since we do not have actual statistical data, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and the field:

1. **P(E|H)**: Computer science students can have a high probability of possessing attributes such as high intelligence, enjoying puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts. These qualities align well with the field, although not perfectly, since attributes like a deep love for animals and empathy might not be as closely associated.
   
   For estimation: Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)

2. **P(H)**: This represents the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Again, without specific data, let's assume an a priori belief that Adam could be equally likely to be in one of several fields. Being more common, let's set it as \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E)**: This is tricky since we need the total probability of Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields. Given the broad nature of his personality traits, we assume a high distribution over many fields, let's put it at a moderate probability \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

Given these assumptions, we can plug into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

So, based on these assumptions and calculations, Adam's posterior probability of being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
