To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we should ideally know the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. Given that we lack specific numerical values for these, we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact numerical probability. Instead, we can make an educated guess based on the traits described and their alignment with the field of computer science.

Given that Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, these traits fit well with the study of computer science. These aspects are highly relevant to the problem-solving and abstract thinking required in this field.

So, qualitatively, we can estimate that there is a moderate to high probability that Adam could be enrolled in computer science, but assigning a specific value without more information isn't possible. For the sake of providing an answer within the constraint given (a value between 0 and 1), considering the details:
