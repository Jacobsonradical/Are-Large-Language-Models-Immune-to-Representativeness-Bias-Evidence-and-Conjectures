To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this scenario, we do not have specific values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), nor the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). 

Given the lack of specific quantitative data, we can consider qualitative insight to estimate the probability. Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work suggest he could have chosen a field that often intersects with these interests. While computer science could still fit (given high intelligence and abstract thinking), these qualities might more naturally resonate with fields such as biology, environmental science, or similar.

Nevertheless, considering that computer science is a broad and versatile field that encompasses various interests, including solving puzzles and abstract thinking, it should not be dismissed.

Let's estimate the probability:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value is chosen qualitatively, considering computer science's relevance to Adam's intelligence and problem-solving ability but acknowledging that his interests might align more closely with natural sciences.
