To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch (E), we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence. For simplicity, let's assume a uniform prior across various fields (as we don't have specific prior probabilities). For example, if there are 10 possible fields, \( P(H) \) would be \( \frac{1}{10} \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. We need to estimate how likely it is for someone with Adam's personality to be in computer science. Given his intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high. Let's estimate it at 0.7.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be found by summing the likelihood of the evidence across all fields weighted by their prior probabilities. Again, assuming a uniform prior and 10 possible fields, it can be approximated as the sum of all individual likelihoods divided by the number of fields. If the likelihoods for the fields range similarly, we approximate \( P(E) \) as an average. 

Given the rough estimation approach:

1. Assume 10 possible fields, so \( P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \),
2. Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \),
3. Assume consistent uniform priors and similar likelihoods for estimation purposes.

Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

If we assume \( P(E) \approx 0.7\) (as all likelihoods are similarly high across fields):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.7} = 0.1 \]
