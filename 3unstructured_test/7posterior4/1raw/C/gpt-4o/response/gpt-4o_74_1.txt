To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several factors, such as prior probabilities and the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. However, since we're working with limited information, any precise calculation would be speculation. Therefore, an estimated probability based on the given personality sketch and typical interests aligned with various fields is provided.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication, it is less likely he was enrolled in computer science compared to fields more directly related to his stated interests (such as biology, environmental science, or botany).

However, Adam is noted to be of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits commonly seen in computer science students as well. Additionally, his puzzle-solving skills correlate with skills often necessary in computer science.

These mixed traits lead us to an intuitive yet speculative estimation.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for computer science might be considered moderate. This operational guess would be slightly less than for fields more directly related to nature.

Here's a formatted answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This value considers both the alignment with his intellectual traits and his more prominent interests in nature and empathy, hence suggesting a somewhat lower probability for computer science.
