To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge about the field of computer science. 

Qualitative Analysis:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering Adam was a graduate student in the U.S., many fields such as computer science have a significant number of students. We can assume a moderate prior probability.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with traits typical of computer science students.
  
- **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of someone with Adam's characteristics can be a sum of probabilities across different fields. Since Adam's traits fit well in several fields, this does not necessarily lean heavily toward computer science alone.

Therefore, qualitatively, Adam's traits somewhat fit computer science, but we lack precise numerical values. We'll assume a moderate posterior probability reflecting a fair alignment without specific numerical computation:
