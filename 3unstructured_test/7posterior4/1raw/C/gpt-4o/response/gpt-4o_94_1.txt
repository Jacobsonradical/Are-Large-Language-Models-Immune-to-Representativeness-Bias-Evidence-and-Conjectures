To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probability \( P(H) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the evidence given the hypothesis, and the overall evidence \( P(E) \). 

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only qualitatively assess the fit based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, computer science does not immediately come to mind as the most likely field. Fields such as biology, environmental science, or even psychology might seem more fitting based on these traits.

Since we do not have exact values but need a quantified answer, our qualitative assessment will translate into assigning a lower value between 0 and 1 to the probability \( P(H|E) \) for computer science.
