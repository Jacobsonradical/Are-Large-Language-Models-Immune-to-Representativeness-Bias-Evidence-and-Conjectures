To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know certain prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. But since we do not have specific numerical values to work with, we have to approach this qualitatively based on the personality sketch and the nature of each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values, we can only assess the relative plausibility of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his described traits.

The personality sketch suggests Adam has:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoyment for solving puzzles.
- A strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good grasp of abstract concepts.
- An appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on his traits, let's assess the likelihood of him being in the computer science field:
- Enjoyment for solving puzzles and high intelligence: Positive correlation with computer science.
- Good understanding of abstract concepts: Positive correlation with computer science.
- A genuine curiosity about nature and appreciation for plants, empathy for animals: Less direct correlation with computer science.

Taking all these into consideration:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.65"
}
```

This value represents a relatively high but not absolute probability, reflecting the mixed but somewhat favorable alignment of his traits with a typical profile for a computer science student.
