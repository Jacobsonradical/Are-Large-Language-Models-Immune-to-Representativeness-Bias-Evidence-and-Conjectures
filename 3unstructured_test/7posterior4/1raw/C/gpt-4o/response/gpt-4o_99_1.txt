To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to:

1. Define the prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science before considering his personality sketch.
2. Define the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. Define the evidence \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the evidence, we can't compute an exact numerical value. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and what is generally known about fields of study.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, understands abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work, we can qualitatively assess how these traits align with the field of computer science.

- Curiosity about nature and plants might not be directly related to computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles is highly relevant to computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are also highly relevant to computer science.
- Strong empathy and a deep love for animals might not be directly related to the typical profile for computer science students.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with many fields, including computer science.

Without more information, we might assign a moderate to high probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science based on his problem-solving skills and intelligence.

Thus, while we can't provide a precise value without specific data, a rough estimate based on the qualitative fit might be reasonable.

{
  "computer science": 0.4
}

This value is a tentative estimation considering that Adam's traits align well with some aspects of computer science, especially problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, but not strongly with others such as curiosity about nature and deep love for animals.
