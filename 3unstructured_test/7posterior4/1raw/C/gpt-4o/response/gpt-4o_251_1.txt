To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't compute an exact numerical value. However, we can make a reasonable qualitative assessment based on the available information.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts give some indication towards fields like computer science.
- Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy might be more closely aligned with fields like biology or environmental science.
- Enjoying puzzles might also tilt slightly toward computer science, but isn't definitive.

So based on the personality sketch, computer science is plausible but not the most likely field given Adam's strong inclination towards nature and animals.

Thus, while a precise number cannot be determined, we might reasonably place a relatively lower posterior probability for computer science.

\[ \text{computer science} \approx 0.3 \]
