To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more information about the base rates and likelihoods. However, with the information given, I'll approximate based on the match between Adam's described characteristics and the typical traits of students in the given field.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We're asked for the posterior for "computer science":

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being a computer science student.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on Adam's traits, how likely is it for a computer science student to have his traits.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The marginal probability of the traits.

Given Adam's high intelligence, abstract conceptual understanding, puzzle-solving ability, and curiosity, these traits are often associated with computer science students. However, his deep love for nature and animals is less typical.

For simplicity and estimation:
- \( P(H) \approx \text{field-specific enrollment rate of computer science graduate students relative to all fields, estimate as 0.15 (15%)} \)
- \( P(E|H) \approx \text{likelihood of a computer science student's traits matching Adam's, estimate as 0.5} \)
- \( P(E) \approx \text{probability of these traits in the entire graduate student population, estimate as 0.25 (25%)} \)

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam is in computer science, given his traits, is approximately 0.3.
