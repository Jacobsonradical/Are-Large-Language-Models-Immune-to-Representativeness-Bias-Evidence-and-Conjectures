To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in the field of computer science, given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Explanation of Terms:
1. **P(H|E)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits described if he was in computer science.
3. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits.

Given we do not have explicit values and specific distributions for these probabilities, let's make some informed estimations based on common knowledge and the information provided.

### Estimations:
1. **P(E|H)**: 
   - While it is possible for a computer science graduate student to have Adam's curiosity, puzzle-solving skills, intelligence, and empathy, these traits might be less common in this field compared to fields like biology or psychology. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

2. **P(H)**:
   - The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science. Considering the popularity of computer science, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

3. **P(E)**:
   - The overall probability of having Adam's traits among all fields of study. Considering that these traits could spread across many fields, let's estimate it to be reasonably common but not very high, say \( P(E) = 0.4 \).

### Simplified Computation:
Using our estimations and plugging them into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.06}{0.4} = 0.15 \]
