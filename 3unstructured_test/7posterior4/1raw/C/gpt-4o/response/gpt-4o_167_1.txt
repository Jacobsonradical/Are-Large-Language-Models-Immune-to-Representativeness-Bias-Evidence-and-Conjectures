To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need additional pieces of information such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science (\( P(H) \)), the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science (\( P(E|H) \)), and the overall probability of observing the evidence (\( P(E) \)). 

However, since we don't have concrete numerical data for these probabilities, I will make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the traits required for computer science. 

Let's assume the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Given that many STEM fields are common among graduate students in the U.S., let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the traits needed in computer science. Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \) (60%).
  
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence. Considering Adam's personality traits and interests might fit equally well with fields like biology, environmental science, and other STEM fields, let's assume \( P(E) = 0.4 \) (40%).

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the assumed values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

So the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is 0.3.
