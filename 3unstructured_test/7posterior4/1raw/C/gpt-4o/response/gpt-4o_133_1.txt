To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have several pieces of information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) across all potential fields of study.

The formula for Bayes' rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we have to make some educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch and typical traits associated with different fields of study.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Deep love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

People with an interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy might be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are also traits commonly associated with computer science.

Assuming:
1. **P(H)**: Represents the general probability of a graduate student choosing computer science. Let's hypothesize it as \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (as it’s a popular field).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with someone in computer science. Let’s approximate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \) (considering some traits align, but not perfectly).
3. **P(E)**: The overall occurrence of Adam’s personality traits. This combines various field likelihoods and is quite broad. Let’s approximate this as \( P(E) = 0.25 \).

Now let's compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.25} = 0.24 \]

Thus, our estimated posterior probability is:
