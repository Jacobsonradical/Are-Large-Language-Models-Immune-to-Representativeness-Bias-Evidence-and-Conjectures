To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more data like prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Since this data is unavailable, we can give a subjective estimate based on the provided personality sketch. Let's analyze how characteristics might align with being a computer science graduate student:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Less directly related to computer science.
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Aligns well with many computer science students who often deal with problem-solving.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals**: Not directly indicative, but doesn't conflict either.
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**: Strong alignment with the skills required in computer science.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Relevant to any rigorous field of study, including computer science.

Since there is a mix of traits that may or may not align with computer science, we need a somewhat balanced approach taking into account the affinity for problem-solving and intelligence. 

Given this information, we'll provide a subjective estimate:
