To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how each term in the formula is defined:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis (that Adam was enrolled in computer science).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis (how likely Adam is to be enrolled in computer science, without any knowledge about his personality sketch).
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence (how likely someone with Adam's personality sketch is in general).

Since we lack specific numerical values for these probabilities and need to make a reasoned estimate based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in the field of computer science, let’s make some qualitative assessments.

1. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems likely that someone with his personality traits could be found in computer science. This probability could be relatively high.

2. **P(H)**: This would depend on the overall proportion of graduate students in the field of computer science. Given the prominence of computer science, we can assume this is moderate to high.

3. **P(E)**: This is the probability of encountering someone with Adam's personality traits across all fields of graduate study.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior probability. For a more precise answer, specific data would be required, but here is a reasoned estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

As we need to be more precise about our assumptions:
- Assume \(P(E|H)\) is 0.7 (high probability of such personality traits in computer science).
- \(P(H)\) could be 0.2 (considering many fields in graduate studies).
- \(P(E)\) is harder to estimate; let’s assume Adam's traits are not extremely rare but moderate, say 0.5.

Then combining these (again, without precise numeric data, these assumptions serve as placeholders):

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.14}{0.5} = 0.28 \]

Thus, a reasonable posterior probability:

{
  "computer science": 0.28
}
