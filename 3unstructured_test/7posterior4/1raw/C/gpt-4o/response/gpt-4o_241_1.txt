In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The prior belief about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Let's denote this as **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's denote this as **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule can be summarized as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific numerical values for these components. Therefore, without clear statistical data, this probability can only be estimated qualitatively based on the given description.

Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong inclination towards natural sciences and solving puzzles, showing a good understanding of abstract concepts. These traits could fit well with computer science, but there might be fields that align even more closely with his deep love for nature and animals, such as biology or environmental science.

Given the qualitative nature of the problem, let us make some educated estimations:
1. **P(H_{CS})**: Assume a general prior probability of 0.2 reflecting a fair distribution among various fields of study graduate students might choose.
2. **P(E|H_{CS})**: Given that Adam's interests and traits partially align with computer science, let's approximate this as 0.4.
3. **P(E)**: Normalizing factor, for simplicity assume it is 1 when considering a single sketch.

So, substituting these estimations, we get:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{1} = 0.08 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.08.
