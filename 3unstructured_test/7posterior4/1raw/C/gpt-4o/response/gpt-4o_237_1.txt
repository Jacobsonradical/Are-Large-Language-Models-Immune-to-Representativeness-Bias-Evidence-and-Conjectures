As much as I'd like to provide you with a precise numerical probability value, determining the exact posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for Adam being enrolled in computer science requires more detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods that are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, let's outline the reasoning and assumptions we might make:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given he is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having this personality sketch irrespective of his field.

Given the personality sketch:
1. **P(E|H)**: We need to assess how likely Adamâ€™s traits are if he is a computer science student. Traits like high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with someone pursuing computer science, but we need to consider whether a strong appreciation for hard work, empathy, and a love for nature and animals are prevalent among computer science students.
  
2. **P(H)**: This requires knowing the prior probability of Adam being in computer science among all possible fields.
   
3. **P(E)**: This requires knowing the overall probability of the personality sketch across all fields of study.

Without detailed statistical data, we can't compute an exact figure but can acknowledge the plausibility:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ is reasonably likely} \]

Given the traits suggesting alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking:

\[ \text{"computer science": "0.6 (this is a hypothetical estimated probability based on reasonable assumptions"} \]

**Note:** This value is not an exact computation but is inferred based on qualitative factors present in the profile and subject to better refinement with concrete data.

Therefore, presenting in the required format based on qualitative reasoning:

  "computer science": "0.6"
