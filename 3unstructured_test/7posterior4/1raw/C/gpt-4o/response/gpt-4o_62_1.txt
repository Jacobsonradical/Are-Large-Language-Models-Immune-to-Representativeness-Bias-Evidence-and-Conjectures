In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to have a priori probabilities and likelihoods, which are not specified in the problem. Without these necessary values, we cannot compute the exact posterior probability.

However, we can discuss the theoretical framework to approach this problem. Bayes' Rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the context:
- \( H \) = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \) = Personality sketch of Adam.

We need:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) occurring.

Due to a lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can't compute an exact value. However, based on Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, a love for solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work, which are common traits among computer science students, we can consider that the probability might be relatively moderate to high, but not exact.

Thus, in the spirit of providing a logical estimation within the constraints, we could provide a hypothetical value reflecting the qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

This value is not derived mathematically due to missing data but reflects a reasoned estimation based on the typical alignment of Adam's traits with those common in the field of computer science.
