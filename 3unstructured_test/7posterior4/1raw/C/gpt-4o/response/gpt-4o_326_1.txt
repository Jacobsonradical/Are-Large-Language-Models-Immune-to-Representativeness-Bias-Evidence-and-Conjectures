To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, let's recall the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In order to provide an answer, we need the following components for our specific case:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given that the hypothesis \( H \) (that Adam was enrolled in computer science) is true.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

As we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities and assuming no additional information is provided, we have to make educated estimates.

1. **P(E|H)**: How likely is Adam's personality sketch if he were a computer science graduate student? Given his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, this seems somewhat plausible but not definitive. We might assign an estimate of 0.4.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science in the U.S. might be relatively moderate compared to the entire graduate student population. As an estimate, we might use 0.1.

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing someone with Adam's personality traits. This would be influenced by the distribution of such traits across all fields. If we assume average probabilities across various fields, we might use a generic estimate of 0.2.

So, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Given this estimation process:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

Remember, these values are approximations and depend heavily on the actual distributions and probabilities, which are not provided here.
