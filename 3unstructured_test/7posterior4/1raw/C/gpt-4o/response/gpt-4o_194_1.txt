To calculate the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for each probability (\(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\)), we cannot compute an exact numerical value for \(P(H|E)\). Instead, we can discuss the likelihood based on the given personality sketch and field of study.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits do not necessarily lean heavily towards computer science, which is typically associated with analytical thinking, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts. However, it does not align with some of Adam's other noted interests and characteristics, such as a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature. These aspects might align more with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Considering this, the probability would reasonably not be very high, but without specific data, we can only provide a rough qualitative estimate. Thus, for an informed but not numerically precise answer:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This value is more intuitive and based on the given personality sketch, indicating that while it's possible Adam could be in computer science, it does not seem to be the most likely field based on his described interests and traits.
