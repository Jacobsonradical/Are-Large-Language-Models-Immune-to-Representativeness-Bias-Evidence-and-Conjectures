To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \): The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To estimate this:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is equal to the general probability of a graduate student being in such a field. For simplicity, let's assume this is 1/10, given that computer science is one of many fields (though a popular one) a graduate student might be in.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to estimate how likely such traits fit a computer science student. While being good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence might be common traits in computer science students, the emphasis on nature, plants, dedication to hard work, and animals might not similarly align. As such, let's generously estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.1.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
  This is the overall likelihood of the traits given across all fields. It's challenging to estimate without comprehensive data, but given the specificity of Adam's traits, a reasonable estimate might be around 0.05, invoking a broad range of possible fields. 

Now, calculating \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability is:
