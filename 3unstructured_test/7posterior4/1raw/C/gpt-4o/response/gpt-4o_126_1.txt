To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch E.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E, which can be computed by summing the likelihoods of all possible fields weighted by their respective prior probabilities.

Bayes' rule is formally expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make some assumptions about these probabilities:

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: While this value should ideally be derived from actual data about the distribution of graduate fields, let's assume equal prior probabilities for different fields. If we consider \( N \) different fields, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \).

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This value represents how likely Adam's personality sketch is given that he is a computer science student. Given his interest in abstract concepts and puzzles, we can assume a higher likelihood. For estimation, let's assign a value like 0.7.

- **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: This is the sum of the likelihoods of E across all potential fields weighted by their respective prior probabilities. If computer science shares similarities with other technical fields such as mathematics, physics, etc., it's likely that \( P(E) \) is a value that is accommodated when considering all fields.

Assuming \( N \) = 10 different fields and knowing \( P(E) \) can be generalized as an average due to equal priors,

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \]  (estimated to be a probable value when accounting for similar fields)

Using Bayes' rule,

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.07}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

Based on these simplified assumptions, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.14.
