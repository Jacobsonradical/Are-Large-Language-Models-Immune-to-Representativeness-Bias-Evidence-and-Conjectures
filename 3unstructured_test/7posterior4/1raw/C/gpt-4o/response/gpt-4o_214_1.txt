To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow this formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To proceed with this calculation, we need estimates for:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence (personality traits) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence (personality traits) across all potential fields of study.

However, given the information provided, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities. Instead, we can use qualitative reasoning based on the given personality sketch and what is commonly known about students in various fields.

For computer science, consider the following:
- Positive indicators: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles can align well with the qualities needed for computer science.
- Neutral/Negative indicators: Strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and its various plants may not be as directly indicative of computer science but do not necessarily preclude it.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here is an approximate value that reflects a moderate-to-high likelihood that Adam could be in computer science:
