In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would need to know the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam would have the described personality sketch if he was indeed enrolled in computer science.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \) which is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch irrespective of the field of study.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on typical data.

Let's assume:
- Prior (\( P(H) \)): The probability a graduate student is in computer science based on general data, say 0.20 (20%).
- Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): Given Adam's personality sketch, how likely it is that these traits match a computer science student, say 0.30 (30%).
- Evidence (\( P(E) \)): The overall probability of these personality traits among all students, for simplicity, let it be 1 (as this parameter normalization conveniently cancels it out in this single comparison scenario).

Using these values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.06 \]

So:

{
  "computer science": "0.06"
}
