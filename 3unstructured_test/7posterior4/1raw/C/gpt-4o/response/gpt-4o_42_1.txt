To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider multiple factors, including the prior probability of Adam enrolling in the field of computer science, the likelihood of a person in computer science possessing the traits described in the personality sketch (E), and marginal probabilities.

However, due to the limited data provided and the need for specific statistical information (like exact prior probabilities and likelihoods), we'll make a reasoned estimate based on the personality traits and their relevance to the field of computer science.

Given that Adam's traits include high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles, which are all favorable traits for computer science, we can estimate that the probability is relatively high.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

This estimate of 0.7 is assuming a higher probability based on the alignment of Adam's interests and skills with those generally found in computer science students.
