To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need prior probabilities and likelihood values for each hypothesis, given the evidence. Since those specific values are not provided, we'll work with the information at hand.

Bayes' rule is as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- E: Personality sketch of Adam.

Since we are missing specific numerical values, we will make an educated estimate based on the provided personality sketch and how well it fits into the typical profile of a computer science student.

Factors to consider:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** Neutral or less indicative of a computer science graduate.
2. **Solving puzzles:** Positive indication, as problem-solving is closely related to computer science.
3. **Warm heart and empathy:** Neutral, this does not strongly correlate with the field of study.
4. **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts:** Positive indication, as these traits are beneficial in computer science.
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Positive, fits many rigorous academic fields including computer science.

Based on these qualitative considerations, we can infer that there is a reasonable likelihood the evidence (personality sketch) matches someone in computer science. Lacking exact numbers for priors and likelihoods, we'll estimate the probability based on the match:

{
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

This value reflects a moderate to high probability, considering Adam's problem-solving skills, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, all of which align well with traits often found in computer science students.
