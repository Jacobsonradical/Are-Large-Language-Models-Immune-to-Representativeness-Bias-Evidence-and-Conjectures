To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) for Adam's field of study being computer science, as well as the marginal probabilities of \( E \) and \( H \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values or additional data, we can only qualitatively assess the likelihood based on the given personality sketch. Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam is studying computer science before considering his personality sketch. This might be based on general enrollment rates for various graduate programs, which we do not have specific data for.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he is studying computer science. Computer science students often exhibit traits such as high intelligence and enjoying solving puzzles, both of which align with Adam's traits.
   
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields of study. This is challenging to determine without broader statistics.

Given the provided personality sketch and the qualitative assessment, Adam's traits such as high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles do align with characteristics commonly found in computer science students. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature may not be as strongly associated with computer science compared to other fields like biology or environmental science.

Based on this qualitative analysis, I'll estimate a moderate probability between 0.4 and 0.6:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.5 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is:
