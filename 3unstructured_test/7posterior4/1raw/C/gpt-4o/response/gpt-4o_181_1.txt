To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since these values are not provided in the question, I can't compute an exact numerical value for \( P(H|E) \) but can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Given the personality traits of Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants,
- Enjoys solving puzzles,
- Quiet demeanor,
- Warm heart and strong empathy,
- Deep love for animals,
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts,
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

A field like Computer Science would be plausible because it requires high intelligence, problem-solving skills, an understanding of abstract concepts, and dedication. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might steer him toward fields more directly involved with nature, animals, or environmental science.

To provide a numerical probability, let's hypothetically assume:
- Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science, \( P(H) \), to be 0.3 (since Computer Science is a popular field among high-intelligence students),
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (how likely the personality traits are if he is a Computer Science student) to be 0.4 (due to the suitability of problem-solving and abstract concept understanding),
- Evidence \( P(E) \) being the sum of probabilities across all fields that would match this personality, let's assume to be 1 for simplicity.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{1} = 0.12 \]

Thus, assuming these values,

{
  "computer science": "0.12"
}
