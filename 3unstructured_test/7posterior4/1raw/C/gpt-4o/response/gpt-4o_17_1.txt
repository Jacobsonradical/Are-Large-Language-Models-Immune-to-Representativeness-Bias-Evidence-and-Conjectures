In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since we do not have these exact values for Adam's scenario, I'll provide a qualitative estimation based on the given information.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make educated guesses about the probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is a computer science student. 
   - Given Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles, it's reasonable to assume these align well with the field of computer science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) as relatively high, say 0.7.

2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is a computer science student.
   - Without specific data, this is tricky, but computer science is a relatively popular field among high-intelligence students.
   - We'll estimate \( P(H) \) to be 0.2 as a prior guess among the multitude of possible fields a graduate student might be in.

3. \( P(E) \): The evidence marginal likelihood, representing how common Adam's personality traits are in general.
   - Adam's traits could fit several fields such as biology, environmental sciences, or psychology.
   - Without exact data, let's assume the personality traits are moderately common. We'll set \( P(E) \) at 0.3.

Plugging these values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.467 \]

Thus, the estimated posterior conditional probability is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.467
}
``` 

This is a rough estimate given the assumed probabilities. For a precise calculation, actual prior, likelihood, and evidence values are necessary.
