  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Explanation: While Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy, and love for animals might not directly suggest a specialization in computer science, his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts are indeed aligned with the skills often found in computer science students. Hence, a value of 0.3 reflects a moderate probability that Adam might be enrolled in that field given his personality traits.
