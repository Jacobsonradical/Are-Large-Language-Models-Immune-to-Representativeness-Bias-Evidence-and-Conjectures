To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have knowledge about several aspects: 

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing personality sketch E (Adam's personality) given that H (Adam was enrolled in computer science).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing personality sketch E irrespective of Adam's enrollment.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the actual numerical values or additional context to these probabilities, it is challenging to calculate an exact posterior probability. In fact, the posterior probability would ideally be computed using statistical data, surveys, or historical evidence about students who match Adam's profile.

Given the lack of exact numerical data, but with some reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality traits, we can make an educated guess. 

Adam's appreciation for abstract concepts and high intelligence fits well with a computer science background. However, his strong empathy, warmth, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might suggest a field more aligned with environmental science or biology. Therefore, while it is possible he could be a computer science student, his personality traits might fit slightly less with this field compared to others which place more emphasis on his love for nature and animals.

So, for the purpose of an illustrative answer based on estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Please note, this estimated value (0.3) is an educated guess rather than a precise computation because the necessary probability values to precisely use Bayes' rule are absent.
