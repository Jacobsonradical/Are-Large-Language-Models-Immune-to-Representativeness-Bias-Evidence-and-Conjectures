To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the field of computer science, we need to make use of the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a credible numerical value, we typically require explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Since these values are not provided in the text, and are contextually dependent on statistical data which we do not have, providing a concrete numeric probability isn't feasible without making assumptions.

Given the description of Adam, we can try to qualitatively assess the probability:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch of Adam suggests he has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract conceptsâ€”all traits strongly associated with computer science students.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: While we do not have specific statistics to go by, computer science is a common field of study for graduate students with the described traits.
3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This would depend on the distribution of the described personality traits across all potential fields of study for graduate students in the U.S.

Assuming that the above description aligns well with the typical traits of computer science students, we might infer a high qualitative probability that Adam fits into this field.

To provide an estimated posterior probability, let's assume a range based on the qualitative fit.

  "computer science": "0.7"

This is a heuristic estimate, suggesting there is a reasonably high probability that Adam might have been in computer science given his personality traits and interests.
