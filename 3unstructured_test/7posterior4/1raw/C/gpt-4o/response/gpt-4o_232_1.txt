To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities of each field \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since we don't have these specific values, we'll have to make some reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume each field has an equal prior probability and then estimate the likelihood based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and those typically needed for each field. Let's focus on computer science:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Since there's no given information, assume the prior probability is equally distributed among possible fields. For simplicity, we assume it is 1/n where n is the number of fields we are considering. Without the exact number, let's just focus qualitatively.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is where we consider how well Adam's characteristics align with the traits commonly associated with success in computer science.

   - **High Intelligence**: Beneficial for computer science.
   - **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Very relevant for topics like algorithms and data structures.
   - **Enjoys Solving Puzzles**: Often associated with problem-solving skills in computer science.
   - **Genuine Curiosity about Nature and Plants**: This is a bit less directly related but could indicate an analytical mind.
   - **Empathy and Deep Love for Animals**: This is less directly related to computer science but doesn't detract from it either.

   Given these considerations, I'd estimate that there is a reasonably high likelihood that Adam's traits would be a good fit for computer science.

Based on this qualitative assessment and assuming a reasonable match with the field of computer science, we can estimate the following:

  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

Please note this is a reasoned estimate in the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods. For a more precise answer, actual statistical data on prior probabilities and likelihoods would be necessary.
