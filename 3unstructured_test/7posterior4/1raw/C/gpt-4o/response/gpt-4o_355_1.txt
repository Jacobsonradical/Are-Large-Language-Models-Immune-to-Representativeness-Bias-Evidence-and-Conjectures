To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence or the probability of observing the personality sketch in general.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific values for these probabilities, we can make educated guesses based on typical scenarios. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### 1. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood
Given that Adam has an interest in abstract concepts and high intelligence, it is reasonable to assume these traits align well with a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles isn't as directly correlated. Let's say:

\[ P(E|H) = 0.2 \]

### 2. \( P(H) \): Prior
This would be the probability that any given graduate student could be in computer science. Graduate programs in computer science are quite common, so it might be higher than average. Let's assume:

\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

### 3. \( P(E) \): Evidence
This is the hardest to estimate without more information, but let's assume the personality sketch provided is reasonably common among graduate students but not excessively so. Let's assume:

\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.25} = \frac{0.03}{0.25} = 0.12 \]
