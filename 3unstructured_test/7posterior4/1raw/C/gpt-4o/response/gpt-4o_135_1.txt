To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we will need to make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch and the field of "computer science."

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   - Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student, like Adam, is enrolled in computer science. This can vary by region and university but let's use a hypothetical prior probability.
   - For instance, we might assume that there is a 20% chance \( P(H) = 0.20 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   - The evidence \( E \) provides some traits that are relevant for computer science students such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, etc.
   - Therefore, we can assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high. Letâ€™s assign a value of \( 0.8 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) irrespective of the specific field. Considering all fields, some characteristics (e.g., empathy and love for animals) might be less common in computer science.
   - To keep it simple, we might estimate \( P(E) = 0.25 \), acknowledging the diversity of personalities in graduate programs.

Putting these reasonable estimates together:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.20}{0.25} = \frac{0.16}{0.25} = 0.64 \]

Given the hypothetical numbers we used, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.64.

Hence the answer will be:

{
  "computer science": "0.64"
