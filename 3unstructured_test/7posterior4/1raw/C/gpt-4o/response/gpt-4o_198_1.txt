To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
1. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch).
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality traits (E) would be observed if he were enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
4. \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields.

Since we do not have concrete numerical priors and likelihoods, we must make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics associated with the field of computer science and Adam's personality traits provided.

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. Adam's traits align well with these characteristics, so \( P(E|H) \) is high.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular field for graduate students in the U.S., making \( P(H) \) reasonably high.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality traits being present irrespective of the field. Since such traits could be seen in students of other fields (e.g., biology, mathematics), \( P(E) \) is not exclusive to computer science.

Given these considerations, let's provide a reasonable estimation for \( P(H|E) \):

This estimation implies Adam's personality and traits make it quite likely that he was enrolled in computer science, though it's not a certainty.
