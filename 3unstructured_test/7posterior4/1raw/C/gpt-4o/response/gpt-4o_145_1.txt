To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the normalization factor \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods (i.e., statistical data on graduate students in computer science and their personality traits), any computation would be a speculative approximation.

Let's make a reasoned estimation based on the provided information about Adam. 

- **Evidence \( E \)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, understands abstract concepts, appreciates hard work, and is a graduate student in the U.S.
- **Hypothesis \( H \)**: Adam is enrolled in computer science.

Personality traits like intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts are common among computer science students. However, Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals may suggest interests in other fields such as biology, environmental science, or even interdisciplinary fields.

Given these considerations, let's assign estimated values for the probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming computer science is one of the more common graduate fields in the U.S.
\[ P(H) \approx 0.2 \] (since there are many fields of study, but computer science is relatively popular).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adamâ€™s traits align somewhat well with traits valued in computer science.
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \]

3. **Normalization Factor \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence over all hypotheses, but for simplicity, let's assume it to be a rough estimate.
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \]

By substituting these values into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.12}{0.5} = 0.24 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is:
