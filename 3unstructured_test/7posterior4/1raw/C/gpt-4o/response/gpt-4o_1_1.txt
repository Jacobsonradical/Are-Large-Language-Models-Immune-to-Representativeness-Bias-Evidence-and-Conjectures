To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science and the likelihood of observing his personality sketch given that he is a Computer Science student. Since these pieces of information are not provided, we can't compute an exact numerical value. 

However, I can walk you through the theoretical approach to this problem using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is a Computer Science student.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Without concrete data, a specific numerical value can't be provided. Nonetheless, based on the qualitative information provided, we can make an educated guess:

Given that Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, these traits are somewhat aligned with characteristics often seen in Computer Science students. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals might align more strongly with fields like Biology or Environmental Science.

Given these considerations, if I were to assign an educated guess:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This assignment acknowledges the alignment of some personality traits with the field of Computer Science while also considering other possible better-fitting fields. However, it's important to note that this is a subjective estimate rather than a mathematically precise value.
