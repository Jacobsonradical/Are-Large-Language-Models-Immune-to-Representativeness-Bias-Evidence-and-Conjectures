To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the given information and reasonable assumptions.

### Assessment:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science without any additional information. Let's assume that there is a moderate likelihood that a graduate student could be in computer science, given today's academic environment. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science. Computer science is a field where high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts are valuable, so \( P(E|H) \) should be reasonably high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):** This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch over all fields. Given that traits like curiosity, empathy, problem-solving, and intelligence can be broadly distributed across various fields, \( P(E) \) might be somewhat high. Let's assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

### Calculation:
Plugging into Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.28 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
