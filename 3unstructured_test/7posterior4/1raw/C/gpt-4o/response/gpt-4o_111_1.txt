To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be computed as the sum of the probabilities of the evidence under all possible fields.

Since we lack specific numerical data for these probabilities, we will make qualitative assessments based on the given information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume equal priors for students being enrolled in different fields such as natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, engineering, and computer science due to lack of specific background information. Therefore, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering the personality sketch of Adam, the likelihood of him being in computer science (a field that generally favors logical thinking and abstract concepts) is relatively moderate. Attributes such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts can correspond well with computer science, although his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy might slightly reduce this likelihood.

   Let's assign a moderate likelihood value, say \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) = 0.4 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of Adam having his personality traits across all potential fields he could be studying. This value would sum the products of the likelihoods for each field and their respective priors.

   For simplicity, and since we don't have specific data for other fields, let's normalize \( P(E) \) to 1 (assuming a hypothetical equal weighting across all fields).

Thus, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{5}}{1} = \frac{0.4}{5} = 0.08 \]

So, we conclude:
