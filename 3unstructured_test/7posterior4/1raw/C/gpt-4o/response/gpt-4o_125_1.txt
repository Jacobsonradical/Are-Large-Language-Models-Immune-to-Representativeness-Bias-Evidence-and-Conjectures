To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to use this formula, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Without concrete numerical values for these probabilities, it's challenging to provide an exact answer. Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality traits and the nature of computer science.

- \( P(E|H) \): Given that computer science often involves abstract thinking and problem-solving, and considering Adam's inclination towards puzzles, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we might reasonably assume \( P(E|H) \) to be relatively high, say 0.7.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science varies by institution, but it's a commonly chosen major. We might assume \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of finding someone with Adam's personality traits. Without specific data, let's assume it's moderate, say \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

Using these assumed values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.14}{0.5} = 0.28 \]

So the posterior conditional probability is:
