To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would need additional information such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science and the likelihood of his personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science. Since this information is not provided, it is not possible to compute an exact numerical value for \( P(H|E) \).

Instead, I can provide a qualitative analysis based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Strengths in Abstract Concepts & High Intelligence**: These traits could align well with computer science since the field often involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking.
2. **Curiosity About Nature & Love for Animals**: These interests might suggest a field related to biology, environmental science, or zoology rather than computer science.
3. **Empathy & Warm Heart**: These characteristics might also be indicative of a field where human or animal interaction is more prevalent, like psychology, social work, or veterinary medicine.
4. **Enjoyment of Solving Puzzles**: This is a trait that aligns well with computer science.
5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This trait is generally applicable to many fields, including computer science.

Given these points, if we had to provide a qualitative assessment rather than a precise numerical probability due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood values, we might posit that Adam could be enrolled in computer science. However, without further information, we cannot specify an exact probability.

Therefore, the answer can be presented as follows:

  "computer science": "Not enough information to compute, qualitative assessment suggests moderate possibility"
