To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch irrespective of the field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the problem lacks specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), I will make some qualitative assessments based on typical characteristics associated with computer science students and the given personality sketch.

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume a general distribution among fields such that the prior probability that a random graduate student is in computer science is moderate due to the popularity of the field. Let’s assume \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's personality sketch:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science students.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is also quite common in computer science students.
   - Strong empathy and a love for nature and animals are less stereotypical but not exclusive.
   Based on these, we might assign a likelihood \( P(E|H = \text{computer science}) \approx 0.6 \) (60%).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch across all fields. Given the sketch is detailed and could fit several fields (including biology, environmental science, etc.), we might estimate this probability to be moderately high. Let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.3 \) (30%).

Using these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.12}{0.3} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability is:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This translates to a 40% probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch E.
