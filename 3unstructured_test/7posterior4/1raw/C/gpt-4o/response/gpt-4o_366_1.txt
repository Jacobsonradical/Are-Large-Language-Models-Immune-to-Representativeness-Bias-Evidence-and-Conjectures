To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the likelihood of Adam being a computer science student before considering his personality sketch.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is a computer science student.
- The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.
  
Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the specific quantitative values for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative evaluation based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge. 

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The probability that any given graduate student is in the field of computer science. In the context of U.S. universities, computer science is a popular field, but without specific data, we generally treat this as non-negligible.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the given personality traits in a computer science student. Computer science students might have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, but traits like a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals might be less commonly associated with computer science students compared to fields like biology or environmental science.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality in the general population of graduate students. Fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology might have a higher likelihood matching the given personality description.

Given these qualitative assessments:
- The **prior** \( P(H) \) for computer science is notable but not overwhelmingly high.
- The **likelihood** \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to moderately low, as empathy and love for animals might be less dominant traits in typical computer science students.
- The overall **evidence** \( P(E) \) for these personality traits being more common in other fields reduces the posterior probability for computer science.

Without precise numerical data for exact computation, I'll provide a reasoned qualitative estimate that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being a computer science student is on the lower side, reflecting the mismatch between E and typical stereotypes of computer science students while still acknowledging their diversity.

This value is a rough estimate informed by qualitative reasoning; it should ideally be based on specific data for a precise answer.
