To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more specific data, such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science ( \( P(H) \)), the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he is enrolled in computer science ( \( P(E|H) \)), and the prior probability of the personality sketch regardless of field ( \( P(E) \)). However, since we don't have these precise values, we can make educated estimates based on the qualitative information provided.

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Without specific data, we assume an average prior probability. Let's consider that there's an equal likelihood of Adam being in any typical graduate field. For simplicity, say there are 10 typical fields of study.
    - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Consider how likely Adam's personality traits match someone in computer science.
    - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts â€” these traits are fairly common in computer science students.
    - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the given personality sketch, irrespective of the field.
    - Assuming the sketch could fit moderately well into several typical fields, we estimate \( P(E) \approx 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Substitute the estimated values:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.2} \approx 0.3 \]

Therefore, considering these estimations:
