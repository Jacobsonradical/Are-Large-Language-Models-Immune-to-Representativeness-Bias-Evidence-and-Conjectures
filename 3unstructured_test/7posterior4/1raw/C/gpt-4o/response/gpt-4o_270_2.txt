To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis H (that Adam was enrolled in computer science) given the evidence E (Adam's personality sketch), we should use Bayes' rule. Unfortunately, to compute this accurately, we need specific probabilities for each component of Bayes' rule:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \): The prior likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability that a graduate student in computer science has the characteristics described in E.
3. The evidence probability \( P(E) \): The overall probability that any graduate student has the characteristics described in E.

Since we don't have numerical values for these probabilities, we can only offer a qualitative analysis based on the personality sketch. Given Adam's attributes:

- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts may suggest a good fit for computer science.
- The deep love for nature, plants, and animals might suggest a preference for fields like biology or environmental science over computer science.
- Empathy and warm-heartedness could fit various fields, but don't specifically point to computer science.

Based on this qualitative analysis, Adam may not be very likely to enroll in computer science as his passion seems inclined towards natural sciences. However, without precise numerical probabilities, this analysis remains speculative.

If we were to provide a speculative value based on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This value of 0.3 indicates that based on the current evidence and without more concrete data, there is a moderate but not high probability that Adam is a computer science student.
