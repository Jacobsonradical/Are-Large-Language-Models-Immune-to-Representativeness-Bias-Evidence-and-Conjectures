To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the evidence \( E \).
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't calculate a precise numerical value. We can, however, provide a qualitative assessment based on general knowledge.

Given that Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts, high intelligence, and problem-solving skills, it might suggest he could thrive in a field like computer science. Nevertheless, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals might suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or a related natural science field could be as relevant or even more so.

Given this context and without exact values, we might estimate a probability based on a general Bayesian approach.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This means that we are estimating there is a 30% chance that Adam could be enrolled in computer science given his described personality traits. This estimation is derived from the balance that, while he may possess the intellectual skills suitable for computer science, his passion for nature and animals might suggest a greater likelihood of enrollment in another field related to those interests.
