To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \), reflecting how likely Adam is to be enrolled in computer science generally.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), reflecting how likely the given personality sketch \( E \) fits someone who is enrolled in computer science.
- The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which is the probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, it is challenging to give a precise calculation. Still, let's make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the information given:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021, the prior probability that he is in computer science could be assumed to be relatively moderate, as computer science is a common graduate field. For the sake of a rough estimate, let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - The personality sketch mentions high intelligence, a good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are quite common among computer science students.
   - However, the strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less characteristic of a typical computer science student.
   - Let's assign a moderate likelihood given these mixed indicators, assuming \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):**
   - This term represents the overall probability of observing such a personality sketch across all possible fields.
   - Given the commonality of high intelligence and abstract thinking in technical fields but the empathy aspect in more social-oriented fields, let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \).

Using these rough estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately:
