To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence \( E \) being observed, marginalizing over all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, we have:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in the computer science field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam having the given personality traits across all fields.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for this example:

- Suppose \( P(E|H) \) = 0.3: It is somewhat likely that someone in computer science has these personality traits, but it's not exceptionally common.
- Suppose \( P(H) \) = 0.2: Prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science.
- Suppose \( P(E) \) = 0.1: The likelihood of any graduate student having these specific personality traits across all fields.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.6.
