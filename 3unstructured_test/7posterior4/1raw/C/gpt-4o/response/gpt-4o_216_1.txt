To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't compute the exact numerical value. Instead, we'll provide a reasonable estimate based on the information given.

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Consider how likely Adam's traits are if he was in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral correlation.
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles: Positively correlated.
   - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts: Positively correlated.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Neutral or slightly negative correlation for the stereotype, but possibly neutral in reality.

2. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The base rate of a graduate student being in computer science in the U.S. Given the prevalence of computer science graduate programs, we can assume a moderate probability.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits, regardless of their field of study.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's make an educated estimate:

- Since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, it increases the likelihood of him being in computer science.
- His empathy and love for animals are less indicative of computer science but do not strongly oppose it.
- Given that computer science is a popular field among graduate students, the prior probability is moderate to high.

Based on the qualitative analysis:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.6 \]

This accounts for the characteristics aligning moderately well with a stereotypical computer science student, but with some traits that might also fit other fields.
