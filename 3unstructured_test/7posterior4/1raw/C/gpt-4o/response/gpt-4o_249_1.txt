To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we are missing specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Without these values, we can't compute an exact number. Instead, I can provide a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it's unlikely he was enrolled in computer science due to the following reasons:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants suggests a more biological or environmental science interest.
2. His strong empathy and love for animals indicate fields related to biology, veterinary medicine, or animal science.
3. While Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which is a good fit for computer science, the other aspects of his personality sketch point more towards fields with a biological or natural focus.

Therefore, we might reasonably estimate a lower probability, but for an exact value, we would need concrete numbers.
