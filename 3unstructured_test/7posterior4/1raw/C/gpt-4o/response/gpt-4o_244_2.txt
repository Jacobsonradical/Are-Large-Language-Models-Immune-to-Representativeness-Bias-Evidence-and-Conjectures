To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before observing the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields of study. 

Bayes' rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make estimations based on the personality sketch and the field in question.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume there is a moderate probability that a graduate student could be enrolled in computer science.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality traits:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not strongly related to computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles: A good fit for computer science.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Not directly relevant to computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: A good fit for computer science.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Fits most demanding academic disciplines, including computer science.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: Probability of the personality sketch irrespective of the field. This is complex to estimate without more data but should include graduates of various disciplines with similar traits.

Without precise data, we qualitatively assess that the fit is moderate. Thus, assuming general prior \( P(H) \approx 0.2 - 0.3 \), likelihood \( P(E|H) \) aligns moderately high maybe \( 0.5 - 0.7 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]
We approximate \( P(E) \) by normalization but qualitatively estimate \( P(H|E) \) moderate.

Exact value calculation impractical, though we infer: 

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

Reflects moderate fit but relies on more data for precisive modeling.
