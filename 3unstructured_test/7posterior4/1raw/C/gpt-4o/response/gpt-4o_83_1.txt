To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in different fields and the likelihood of his personality traits given each field. As such information is not provided, we are unable to compute an exact numerical value for \( P(H|E) \).

However, based on the information available in the personality sketch, we can qualitatively assess how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in various fields, including computer science.

Considering the characteristics described:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest that Adam could potentially be enrolled in fields related to biology, environmental science, animal science, or computer science (given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles).

However, fields like biology or environmental science seem to align more closely with his interest in nature and animals. While he could be in computer science due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, it is less emphasized compared to his interest in nature and animals.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can offer an educated guess:

{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This value is chosen to reflect that while it's possible for Adam to be enrolled in computer science, his personality sketch suggests a stronger alignment with fields connected to nature and animals.
