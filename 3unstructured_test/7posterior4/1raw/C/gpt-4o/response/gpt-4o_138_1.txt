To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider several components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E | H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical data for these probabilities, the values will be estimated qualitatively based on the provided sketch. As it is a simplified estimation, the final value should reflect these qualitative assessments:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood of an average person being enrolled in computer science.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E | H) \)**: How well the personality sketch fits a typical computer science student. Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles fit the profile of many computer science students.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality across all fields.

Given Adam's characteristics, one might estimate that the probability of his personality fitting into various fields is fairly distributed, but with a slightly higher fit for fields like biology, environmental science, or computer science due to his curiosity, intelligence, and love for animals. 

Thus, qualitatively and without specific data, an estimated value for \( P(H|E) \) would be within the context of these considerations.
