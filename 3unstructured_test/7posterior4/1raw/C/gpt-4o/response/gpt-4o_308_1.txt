To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch.

However, we don't have explicit values for these probabilities. But, we can make an educated guess based on the given personality sketch. Here is how we can reason through it:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: We need to consider the prevalence of computer science students among graduate students in the U.S. in 2021. Let's assume this is moderately common, but not the majority.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: We need to consider how well Adam's personality fits the stereotype of a computer science graduate student. While computer science students may have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, the strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants might be less common in that field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields of study. Given that Adam's traits of empathy and love for nature may align better with fields like biology or environmental science, this could be lower.

Given these points, we can hypothesize that while Adam could be a computer science student, the probability might not be very high. Let's assign an approximate value:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \]
