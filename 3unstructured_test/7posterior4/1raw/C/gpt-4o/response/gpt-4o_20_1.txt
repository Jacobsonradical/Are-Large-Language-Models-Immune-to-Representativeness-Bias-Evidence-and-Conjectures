To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we do not have precise numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can use an intuitive approach based on the given information to estimate them.

Given the personality sketch:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We can make educated guesses:

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality is in computer science. Considering "enjoys solving puzzles" and "high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts" are strong indicators for computer science, but the love for nature, plants, and animals is not typical for the field.
- \( P(H) \): The general probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in computer science, which is moderately high given the field's popularity.
- \( P(E) \): The overall likelihood of a student with this personality sketch, which heavily features empathy and natural curiosity, but is not typical for the specific profile of a computer scientist.

Given that Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly align with typical traits for a computer science graduate student but his problem-solving skills do, we'll give this a moderate probability, leaning towards lower.

Let's suppose:
- \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.3 (not very likely but not impossible),
- \( P(H) \) might be around 0.2 (given the popularity of the field),
- \( P(E) \) we can assume to be similar across various fields, let's assume a relative balance.

So, we approximate:

\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will normalize the probabilities:
