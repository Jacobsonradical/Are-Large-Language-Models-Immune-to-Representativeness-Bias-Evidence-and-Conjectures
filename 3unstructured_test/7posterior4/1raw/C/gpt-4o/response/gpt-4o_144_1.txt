To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to take into account the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the probability of observing his personality sketch given that he is in computer science, and the overall probability of observing his personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have explicit prior probabilities, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch itself.

Given the information, Adam has characteristics (empathy, love for animals, understanding of nature, appreciation for dedication) that could be common but not exclusive to various fields. Letâ€™s assume the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Suppose we assume that the likelihood of Adam enrolling in any field is initially equal due to lack of additional information.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - These characteristics are less commonly emphasized in computer science, which often values logical, analytical, and technical skills.

Thus, the subjective probability values based on this rationale might look like:

- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)  (as he might be equally likely to be in any among ten common graduate fields)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.05 \) (as such a personality sketch is less common in computer science)
- \( P(E) \), in this context, can be considered a normalizing constant.

Based on these assumptions:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Given the need for a value between 0 and 1, and lack of baseline data for \( P(E) \), we can reasonably assume it ensures the product is normalized.

Finally, to avoid cumbersome calculations without precise data and focusing on the interpretive result:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.05"
}
```

This reflects a cautious predictive value based on provided information.
