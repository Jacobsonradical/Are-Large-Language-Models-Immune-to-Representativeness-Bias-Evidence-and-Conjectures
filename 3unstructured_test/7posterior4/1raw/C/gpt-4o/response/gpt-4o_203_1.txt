To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have an understanding of the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in computer science, and the overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact probability. Instead, we can reason through the information and give a subjective estimate based on the provided descriptions.

Considering the evidence \( E \):
- Adam is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts.
- Adam is a graduate student in 2021.
- Adam has curiosity about nature and empathy for animals, along with an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

The field of computer science often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and understand abstract concepts. However, curiosity about nature and empathy for animals might be less directly aligned with typical interests in computer science.

We can make a reasonable subjective estimation:

\[ P(H|E) \] for computer science is moderately likely, but not certain, given the high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles, albeit the interest in nature and animals seems less relevant.

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Thus, a value of approximately 0.6 seems reasonable, reflecting a moderate likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
