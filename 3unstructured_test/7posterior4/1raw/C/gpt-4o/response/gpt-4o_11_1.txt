To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the general probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science in 2021. Given no specific data, we can assume a general probability based on Adam's interests and traits. Let's denote this as \( P(H_{CS}) \). This could be something like 0.2, considering it as one of several possible fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in computer science. Let's assume Adamâ€™s traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles make it somewhat likely (~0.5).

3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of the field he is in. Given the general distribution of various fields and traits, we might assign it a value like 0.3.

\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch can be estimated as approximately 0.33.
