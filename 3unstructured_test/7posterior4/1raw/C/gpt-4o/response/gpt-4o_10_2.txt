To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \): the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we would need to estimate them based on the given personality sketch and common knowledge. Here is a reasoned approach to estimate these probabilities:

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \):** In graduate programs, computer science is a common field, but there are many possible fields Adam could be in. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderate, around 0.2.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Given the personality traits such as intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles, which are quite relevant to computer science, letâ€™s assign this a high value, around 0.6.
- **Evidence \( P(E) \):** This is tricky without more specific data, but assuming that Adam's traits could apply to various fields (e.g., biology, philosophy, etc.), let's estimate this moderately at 0.4.

Using these estimates, we apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
