To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we would generally need more information about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in a specific field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of his personality sketch fitting someone in that field. In the absence of specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make qualitative assumptions based on typical characteristics of graduate students in computer science relative to the personality sketch of Adam.

However, to align with the format you're seeking and provide a realistic estimate:

- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, another trait common among computer science students.
- His strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals might not be directly associated with computer science, but it does not preclude him from being a computer science student.

Assuming a reasonable prior probability for Adam being in each field and considering the likelihood of his personality traits fitting a computer science student, we can provide a subjective posterior probability estimate.

{
  "computer science": "0.75"
}

This value represents the belief that, given Adam's personality traits, there is a 75% chance he was enrolled in computer science.
