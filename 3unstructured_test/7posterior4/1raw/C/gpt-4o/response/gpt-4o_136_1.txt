To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since these values are not provided in the scenario, it is impossible to compute an exact numerical probability. However, I can provide an estimated value based on the given personality sketch.

Given the personality traits of Adam, which suggest a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and abstract concepts, a field such as biology or environmental science might seem more directly aligned with his interests. However, computer science is still a possibility, especially if Adam applies his abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills within the field. 

Considering these factors, an estimated posterior probability can be assigned.
