In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, without these specific values given, we cannot compute an exact numerical posterior probability. Instead, we can discuss the qualitative factors that would influence \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the field of computer science (CS):
- Prior probability \( P(H) \): What is the general likelihood that a graduate student in the U.S. is studying CS?
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): How likely is it to observe the personality traits (E) given that Adam is a CS student?
- Evidence \( P(E) \): How likely is it to observe these personality traits in any graduate student?

Given:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are qualities very much aligned with CS.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles is also commonly associated with CS students.
- Appreciation for nature, plants, and animals could be less typically associated with CS but doesn't exclude it.

Without specific numerical values, we can qualitatively assess that:

{
  "computer science": "Subject to qualitative judgment, let's posit a likely value around 0.7, given Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills."
}

However, to provide a specific value, detailed statistical data would be required.
