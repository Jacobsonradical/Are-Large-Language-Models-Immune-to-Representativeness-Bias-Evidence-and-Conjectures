To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we would need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in computer science, and the overall probability of observing the personality sketch. However, since we don't have actual numerical values for these probabilities, it is not possible to calculate a specific numerical value for P(H|E).

Typically, a scientist would gather such data to compute such a probability. 

Given only the qualitative assessment, we can assign a subjective probability based on whether Adam's personality traits match the general stereotypes of computer science students. However, note that this would heavily rely on assumptions and stereotypes without quantitative backing.

Given Adam's high intelligence, quiet nature, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work—all characteristics that can be associated with a good number of computer science students—a reasonable person might subjectively assign a higher probability to him being in fields like computer science.

For example, if we were to intuitively decide:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

Remember, this value is not calculated but instead an estimation based on the personality traits described and how they might align with typical attributes associated with computer science students.
