To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we should know the prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since this information is not provided, I'll make assumptions based on common scenarios.

Let:
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) be the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) be the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions:
- Without specific prior knowledge, assume a neutral prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science among the possible fields, say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).
- Compare this with the assumed likelihood of the personality traits aligning with computer science. Given Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence, a higher likelihood, \( P(E|H) \), could be around 0.5.
- The total probability \( P(E) \), if we assume all fields equally likely and combine these, for simplicity, can be approximated as \( P(E) = 0.1 \times (a sum of considered likelihoods) \). Let this be around 0.4 for simplicity.

Using these assumptions:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.05}{0.4} = 0.125 \]

Therefore:
