To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being in a computer science program, the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in a computer science program, and the overall probability of Adam having those personality traits regardless of his field of study. 

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the necessary specific prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided in this context. What we can do is make an educated estimation based on the personality sketch provided and see how likely it is for someone with such traits to be in the field of computer science.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
Praying a prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science from the general student population might range anywhere, say 0.1 - 0.4 depending on university demographics (let's assume \( 0.25 \)).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
A personality that includes curiosity about nature and abstract problem-solving skills can be quite aligned with computer science, but the deep love for animals and empathy might be less typical for the stereotype. We'd estimate this being moderately likely, say \( 0.4 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
This is the probability of someone having this personality sketch regardless of their field, which includes both subjective traits common across many domains and some quite specific. Let's assume \( 0.3 \).

Given these values:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.333
\]

So the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E is approximately:

{
  "computer science": "0.333"
}

Note: This is a simplified computation and relies on estimated values for prior, likelihood, and evidence probabilities. Actual computation would need detailed empirical data.
