To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we will follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate the terms in this formula:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Suppose we assume it to be relatively common for graduate students.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science. Based on his attributes, this would be influenced by how common those characteristics are among computer science students.
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence, or how common the personality sketch is overall among graduate students.

Given the parameters we have are abstract and based on our own assumptions rather than concrete data, we need to make educated guesses based on typical distributions and reasoning:

1. Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \). Computer science is a common field, but not the most common of all graduate fields.
2. Estimate \( P(E|H) \). Adam's qualities such as high intelligence, problem-solving affinity, and understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science. We might estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.6 \).
3. For \( P(E) \), since the qualities described could be present in various fields of study, assume \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \) as it represents a moderate distribution across a variety of fields.

Plugging in these estimations:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.4} = \frac{0.12}{0.4} = 0.3 \]

Hence, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.3.
