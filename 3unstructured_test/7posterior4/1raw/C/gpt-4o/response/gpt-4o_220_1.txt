To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider a few different probabilities and likelihoods. However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative assessment. 

Bayes' rule is applied as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, or the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and its various plants, his deep love for animals, and his high intelligence, it might be less likely for him to be enrolled in computer science. Individuals in computer science may not typically be those who have a strong appreciation for nature and animals, though it is certainly possible. 

Thus, without specific numerical values, we should provide a reasoned estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \]
