Calculating the precise posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the described personality sketch would require access to prior probabilities and likelihoods, which aren't provided. However, I can offer an informed estimation based on patterns and knowledge related to the field of study and personality traits.

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy could be suggestive of a field related to environmental science, biology, or psychology. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, however, could align well with computer science. Nevertheless, without specific priors and likelihoods, a well-justified estimation must remain somewhat qualitative.

Given these considerations, if we make an educated estimate:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants** might slightly reduce the likelihood for computer science.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**, **high intelligence**, and **understanding abstract concepts** are strongly aligned with the skills beneficial for computer science.
3. **Quiet** and **empathetic** traits are neutral but don't necessarily weigh heavily towards computer science compared to other fields.

Let's estimate the posterior probability with some cautious reasoning:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}

This value reflects a balanced consideration of Adam's traits, with an emphasis on the fit between his problem-solving skills and abstract thinking, which are key in computer science, and a slight detracting factor associated with his deep connection to nature and animals. The final value remains speculative due to the lack of concrete base rates and more specific personality-to-field data correlations.
