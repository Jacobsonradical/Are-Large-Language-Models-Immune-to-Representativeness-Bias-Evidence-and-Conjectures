To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the context and the formula. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the priori probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the unconditional probability of the personality sketch.

Given the information, let's consider:

1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in computer science. Since Adam shows interest in puzzles, abstract concepts, and high intelligence, which align with traits common in computer science students, we might assign a high value (let's assume 0.7).

2. **P(H)**: The a priori probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science. Without specific data, we can assume it's moderate for a graduate student (let's assume 0.2).

3. **P(E)**: The unconditional probability of the personality sketch. This is challenging to estimate without more information but can be approximated. Since the described traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) may be common but not necessarily dominant among graduate students, we can assume a reasonable moderate value (let's assume 0.3).

Using these values, we'll apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.14}{0.3} \approx 0.47 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.47. Hence,
