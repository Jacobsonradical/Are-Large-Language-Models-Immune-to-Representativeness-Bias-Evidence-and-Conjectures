To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science before considering the personality sketch.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch regardless of Adam's field.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information provided, we can make some reasoned assumptions to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a uniform prior among various popular graduate fields. For simplicity, we can estimate it as 1 divided by the number of major fields (like computer science, biology, engineering, etc). If we consider 5 such fields, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering Adam's personality sketch highlights intelligence and abstract thinking, which align with computer science, but also emphasizes empathy, a love for nature, and animals, which might not be a perfect fit for a typical computer science student. We might estimate this to be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

3. **Marginal likelihood, \( P(E) \)**: This is the tricky part. It requires summing up the probabilities of the personality sketch across all considered fields. Given our uniform prior and lack of specific data, let's assume all fields equally contribute to this sketch. For simplicity, we may approximate it similarly to our uniform prior - as \( P(E) = 1 \) (since we are just considering Adam's specific attributes, not the probability spread over all potential candidates).

Using these estimates:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.08 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
