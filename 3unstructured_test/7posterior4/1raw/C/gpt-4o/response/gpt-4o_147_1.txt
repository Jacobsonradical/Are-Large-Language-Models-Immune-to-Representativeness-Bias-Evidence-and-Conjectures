To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence or the total probability of observing E.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities or detailed statistical information, we can only provide a subjective estimate of these values given the information about Adam's personality.

Considering Adam's attributes:

- Curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Although Adam has qualities that can be related to computer science (enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts), certain characteristics such as a curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy might align him more toward fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Since exact data is not provided, a reasonable estimation for the conditional probability would be between 0 and 1. Given the description:

\[ P(H|E) = 0.2 \]
