To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of the evidence given that hypothesis, and the overall probability of the evidence.

However, we lack sufficient data for precise numerical values, so we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence (E).

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Although computer science students often exhibit high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work, Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals might suggest a field more directly related to these interests. Fields like biology, environmental science, or even cognitive science might be a better fit.

Without precise data, we can make an educated guess that the probability \( P(H|E) \) for computer science is relatively lower compared to fields directly related to his stated interests. Therefore, if we were to assign a qualitative probability:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \]

This qualitative assumption places a moderate but not high probability on Adam being in computer science, suggesting other fields might be more likely.
