To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need specific probabilities or relevant data to input into the formula. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing the personality sketch of Adam, given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam.

However, in the absence of actual numerical probabilities, I can provide a reasoned guess based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align somewhat but not perfectly with a typical computer science profile. His curiosity, intelligence, and love for solving puzzles fit well, but his marked love for animals and empathy might suggest other fields like biology or environmental studies.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) to be moderate for computer science.

Given the lack of precise data and relying on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This estimated value represents a moderate likelihood, acknowledging both the fit and some divergence with stereotypical computer science profiles.
