To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we typically need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since these specific probabilities are not provided, we will consider a qualitative approach to estimate the probability based on the given personality sketch and the field of computer science.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the qualitative details about Adam, we can make the following observations:

- Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which is essential in computer science.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
- His empathy and love for animals do not directly relate to computer science but do not act as counter-indications either.

Given these observations, it seems reasonably likely that Adam could be enrolled in computer science. However, without concrete probabilities, we estimate the posterior probability based on the alignment of his personality with the traits commonly associated with computer science students.
