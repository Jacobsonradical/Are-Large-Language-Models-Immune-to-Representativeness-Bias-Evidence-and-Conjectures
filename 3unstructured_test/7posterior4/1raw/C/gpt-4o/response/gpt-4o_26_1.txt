To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he's enrolled in computer science, and the overall likelihood of Adam possessing these traits irrespective of his field. Since this specific information is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical probability.

However, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood of Adam's enrollment in computer science based on his personality sketch:

- **Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: These traits are highly relevant to computer science, which often involves complex problem-solving and understanding of abstract ideas.
- **Enjoyment in solving puzzles**: This trait aligns well with computer science, particularly with coding and algorithmic challenges that are essentially puzzles.
- **Quiet and empathetic nature**: These traits are not strongly suggestive of computer science specifically, but they don't rule it out either.
- **Curiosity about nature and love for animals**: These traits might be less directly related to computer science and more suggestive of fields like biology or environmental science.

Given the qualitative match between some of Adam's traits and the requirements of computer science, we might estimate a moderate probability. Without precise data, we can suggest an estimated probability.
