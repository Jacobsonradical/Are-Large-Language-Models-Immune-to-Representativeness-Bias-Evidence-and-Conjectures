To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in different fields (P(H)), the probability of observing the evidence (P(E)), and the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)). 

However, since this question does not provide any specific values for these probabilities, we'll make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch and the common characteristics of computer science students.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

Here are some considerations:
- Enjoying solving puzzles and having high intelligence fits well with the field of computer science.
- Good at understanding abstract concepts is a strong indicator towards fields requiring such skills, including computer science.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals might lean towards fields like biology or environmental science, but they do not exclude computer science.

Based on these qualitative factors, without exact numerical values, we might estimate the posterior conditional probability for computer science to be relatively moderate but not strictly high or low.

Note that this is a subjective estimation. For an accurate calculation, precise prior probabilities and likelihood values would be needed.
