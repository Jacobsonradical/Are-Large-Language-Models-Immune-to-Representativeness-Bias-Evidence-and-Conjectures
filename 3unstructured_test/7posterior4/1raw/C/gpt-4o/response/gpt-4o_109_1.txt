To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the personality sketch \( E \) provided, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to carry out the computation, we'd need specific values for the following:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field Adam is enrolled in.

Given that we lack specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can instead reason qualitatively based on the details provided in the sketch. 

Adam's personality sketch highlights:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Strong empathy and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Considering these traits:
1. Empathy and a love for animals could suggest fields like biology, environmental science, or related disciplines more strongly than computer science.
2. Curiosity about nature may not strongly correlate with computer science, which is generally more abstract and less directly focused on natural environments.
3. Enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts, do align well with computer science, as it often involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking.

Given these deliberations, Adam's interests might be somewhat aligned with computer science due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, but his empathy and love for animals might indicate a stronger alignment with other fields.

With these qualitative assessments in mind, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) might be relatively moderate but not particularly high for computer science.

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This value suggests a moderate likelihood but accounts for the fact that other fields might still be more aligned with his personality traits.
