To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

1. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. Without specific data, we might assume a baseline probability that a graduate student might be enrolled in computer science. Let's assume this to be \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality traits described if Adam was enrolled in computer science. Given that Adam has a love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, but computer science typically does not directly involve these elements, let's conservatively estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of his field. This is more challenging to estimate without specific data. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.1 \]

So using our assumptions, the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.1.

Therefore, the answer is:
