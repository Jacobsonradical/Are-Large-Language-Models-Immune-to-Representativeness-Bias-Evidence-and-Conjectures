To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities and additional data which are generally not provided directly in this context. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only suggest a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch. Here is an attempt at a reasonable guess, albeit a subjective one:

- Adam has traits such as high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts which are common in computer science students.

Given these qualitative statements, one might subjectively assign a fairly moderate-to-high probability to the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science, but without concrete data, this is speculative.
