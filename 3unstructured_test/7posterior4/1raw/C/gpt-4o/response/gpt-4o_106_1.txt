Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need several pieces of information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science. This would depend on background information, such as the general probability of a graduate student in the U.S. being in a computer science program.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch would occur if he were in computer science. This can be quite subjective but should be informed by typical traits of computer science students.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):** The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data, we'll need to make some educated assumptions to provide a value.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Assume a moderate prior probability. Let's say there is a 20% chance (0.2) that any given graduate student is in computer science.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This requires us to match Adam's personality traits with typical computer science students. Adam's traits suggest someone who is intelligent, good with abstract concepts, enjoys puzzles, and has a love of animals. The first three traits can be common in computer science, but the love of nature and animals might not be typical. So, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.4.
- **Evidence \( P(E) \):** This represents the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits in the general population of graduate students. Let's assume this probability is fairly balanced and set it at 0.5.

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.08}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science is approximately:
