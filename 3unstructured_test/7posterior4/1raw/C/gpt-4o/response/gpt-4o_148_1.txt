To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have explicit prior probabilities P(H), likelihood P(E|H), or marginal likelihood P(E) provided in the prompt, we can only make an educated estimate based on the information given about Adam's interests and personality.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a strong appreciation for hard work, while also understanding abstract concepts, these traits partially align with characteristics that can be found in computer science students, such as problem-solving and abstract thinking. However, his deep love for animals and nature might suggest other fields like biology or environmental science might be a more likely fit.

Hence, we provide an estimated probability:
