To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the data we have, let's make some reasonable assumptions for the sake of this exercise:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Letâ€™s assume the prior probability that Adam is a computer science graduate student. We may assume that there is an equal distribution among various fields of study, but since computer science is quite common among graduate students, a typical prior might be around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam having the described personality traits if he is a computer science student. Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence and analytical skills necessary for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, so we could reasonably estimate this to be around 0.3 (30%).

3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of a graduate student having the described personality traits regardless of their field. Since Adam's traits such as a warm heart, empathy, and a deep love for nature and animals may not be very specific to computer science, but rather to biology or environmental sciences, we'd consider this to be around 0.2 (20%).

Combining these, we get:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam is a computer science graduate student given his personality sketch \( E \) is approximately 0.15 (15%).

The answer in the specified format is:
