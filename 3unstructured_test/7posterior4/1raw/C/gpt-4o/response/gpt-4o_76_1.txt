To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have a prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). 

However, as an AI model, I don't have access to specific statistical data to define these values precisely. Instead, I can guide you through a logical estimation based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch.

Let's break it down:
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The general likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science, purely based on the distribution of graduate students across all fields.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described traits if he were a computer science student.
- **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The general likelihood of any student having the described traits.

Considering the given sketch, Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and understands abstract conceptsâ€”all traits that align well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for nature, and animals might suggest a field like biology or environmental science if we were to consider this more formally. 

Based on this informal heuristic reasoning, we might estimate that there is a reasonable chance Adam is enrolled in a program like computer science, but without specific prior distributions and likelihoods, this remains an educated guess.

Let's denote this as a moderately high probability that takes into account both the alignment and potential alternative fields. 

Here is an estimated value:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

This estimated probability of 0.7 suggests that it is somewhat probable, given the described traits, that Adam is a computer science student, though not certain without more concrete statistical data.
