To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more prior and likelihood information. Since we don't have explicit numerical values for prior probabilities or likelihoods, the result will be a qualitative estimation rather than a precise value. However, we can analyze and discuss the components based on the information given:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( H \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

Without explicit numerical values but given the qualitative aspects of the personality sketch, we can consider:
1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in computer science.
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with many fields, including computer science.
   - His puzzling-solving interest is particularly aligned with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
   - His curiosity about nature and empathy, while not directly related, do not negate the possibility of being in computer science.
  
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
   - While this is a bit more arbitrary without explicit data, computer science is a very common field for intelligent problem-solvers.

3. **P(E)**: The marginal likelihood of the personality sketch.
   - This is prior knowledge about how common Adam's characteristics are across fields. 

Given these points, while we cannot provide an exact numerical value, we can qualitatively infer that there is a somewhat reasonable chance based on Adam's characteristics aligning well with someone in computer science. Nonetheless, empathy and love for animals might suggest fields related to biology or environmental science are also highly plausible.

Putting this analysis together while acknowledging the lack of precise priors and likelihoods, we could conservatively estimate within a moderate to reasonable range. Let's assume a moderate value reflecting some significant alignment without overwhelming certainty:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This value implies a moderate likelihood that Adam might be enrolled in computer science, given the provided personality sketch, while still leaving room for other fields being possible.
