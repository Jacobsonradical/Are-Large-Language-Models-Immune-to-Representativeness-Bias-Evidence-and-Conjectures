To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need several pieces of information, including the prior probability (initial belief before seeing evidence), the likelihood (probability of the evidence given the hypothesis), and the probability of the evidence occurring under all possible hypotheses. 

However, since we do not have specific numerical input values for these components and are instead making a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch, we will provide an estimated value based on the fit between the field and Adam's characteristics.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given Adam's curiosity, intelligence, capability with abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles, he does exhibit traits that align well with someone who might succeed in computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals suggest a passion that may also lean toward fields more directly related to biology, environmental science, or animal studies.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the posterior probability would reflect a strong but not certain alignment with computer science:
