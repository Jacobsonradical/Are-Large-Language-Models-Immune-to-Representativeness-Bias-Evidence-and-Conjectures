To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information provided, it's challenging to assign precise values to these probabilities without additional context or data about prior distributions and likelihoods. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and information about common characteristics of graduate students in different fields.

In this case, Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a deep love for animals. While these traits are not incompatible with computer science, they might be more typically associated with fields like biology or environmental science.

Therefore, we might intuitively estimate that:
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that a person with such traits is in computer science might be moderately low.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being a computer science student could be assumed based on general enrollment statistics in the U.S. However, without specific data, we'll consider it moderate.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence with all hypotheses is difficult to ascertain, but we can think of it as a normalization constant.

Given these qualitative assessments, we might hypothesize that the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for computer science is relatively low, though not negligible.

Therefore, a rough estimate might look like this:

{
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note that this is a speculative estimate based on the available qualitative information and should not be taken as a definitive numerical probability without further data and analysis.
