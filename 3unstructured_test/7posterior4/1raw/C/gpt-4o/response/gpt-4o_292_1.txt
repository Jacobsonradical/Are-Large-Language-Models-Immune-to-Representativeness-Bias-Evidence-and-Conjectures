In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we typically need more specific information such as the prior probability \( P(H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since this information is not provided and assuming we base the estimate purely on the qualitative fit of E (Adam's personality sketch) to the hypothesis of him being in the field of computer science, we can make an educated guess but cannot compute an exact numerical value.

Based on Adam's personality traits and interests described in E:
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and empathy
- Love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits fit reasonably well with someone in computer science, especially the aspects of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals might be more indicative of a field related to biology or environmental science. Given these considerations, we might assign an intermediate probability to him being in computer science.

Therefore, a conceptual conditional probability might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.5"
}
```

This value acknowledges the relevance of his traits to computer science while also considering that his interests might align well with other fields as well.
