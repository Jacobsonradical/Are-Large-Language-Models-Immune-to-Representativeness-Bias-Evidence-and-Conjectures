To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the field of computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is described as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam exhibiting the personality traits given he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality traits or the evidence.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will use a qualitative approach to estimate the posterior probability based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Typically, about **X%** of graduate students in the U.S. might be enrolled in computer science. For simplicity, let's denote this as **P(H)**, where \( X = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   Assess the likelihood of the personality traits for a computer science student:
   - High intelligence (highly likely in computer science)
   - Good understanding of abstract concepts (matches well with computer science)
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (common among computer science students)
   However, strong empathy and a love for animals might not be specific to computer science but could still be present.

   Let's estimate this likelihood as: \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):**
   This is the probability of observing the personality traits regardless of the field:
   - The traits such as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are common across several fields.
   - Empathy and love for animals might be more common in fields like biology or environmental science.

   For simplicity, let's estimate \( P(E) \) as the weighted average of multiple fields. Assuming a moderate diversity: \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

### Bayesian Calculation

Using the above estimates: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Plugging in values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.5} = \frac{0.07}{0.5} = 0.14 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is approximately:
