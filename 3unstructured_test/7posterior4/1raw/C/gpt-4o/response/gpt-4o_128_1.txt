To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, we would need the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science without knowing his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were indeed enrolled in computer science.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, considering all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numeric values for these probabilities, we can make a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality traits and the typical attributes of someone studying computer science.

### Qualitative Assessment:

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a popular field, but not overwhelmingly so, suggesting a moderate prior.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Key traits in Adam's sketch, such as high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and solving puzzles, align well with computer science. However, his deep love for animals and strong empathy could suggest he'd be more inclined towards fields related to biology, ecology, or psychology. Thus, the likelihood is moderate to high but not the highest possible.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This takes into account Adam's personality sketch fitting into multiple fields, potentially diluting the specific alignment with computer science.

### Estimation:
Considering these points, we might conclude that there is a decent but not definitive probability that Adam was in computer science.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the posterior probability might be around 0.4 to 0.6.
