To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the initial probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science without considering the evidence (E).
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence (E) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. **Marginal Probability \(P(E)\)**: This is the overall probability of observing the evidence (E) across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E)\), we must make educated assumptions based on typical characteristics related to computer science students and the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Typical characteristics of computer science students may include:
- High intelligence and good problem-solving skills (matches Adam's traits).
- Interest in abstract concepts (matches Adam's traits).
- Curiosity and dedication towards learning (potentially matches Adam's traits).
- Empathy and a warm heart are less directly relevant but not exclusive to computer science students.

Based on these characteristics, we can reasonably assume:
- \(P(H)\): Let's assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) for computer science, given a graduate student's possible fields of study at a university.
- \(P(E|H)\): Given that Adam's characteristics align relatively well with those of a typical computer science student, let's assign a likelihood of 0.7 (70%).
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing a student with Adam's traits irrespective of the field, let's assume it to be 0.2 (20%).

Now, applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science, given his personality sketch, is 0.35 (35%).
