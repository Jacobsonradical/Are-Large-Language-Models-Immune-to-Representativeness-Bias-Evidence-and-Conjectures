To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, calculating exact probabilities requires specific data about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since we don't have this precise data, I will provide a qualitative estimate based on the given personality sketch of Adam and how well it aligns with the typical characteristics and interests of someone studying computer science.

1. **P(E|H) - Likelihood**: Given the traits:
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles.
   
   These traits align fairly well with someone pursuing computer science, as the field often requires strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

2. **P(H) - Prior**: The prior probability that any given graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in computer science. This needs to consider the overall distribution of fields among graduate students. Computer science is a common field but not overwhelmingly so compared to all graduate fields.

3. **P(E) - Evidence**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \). This is the sum of the likelihoods of \( E \) across all possible fields weighted by their prior probabilities. 

Without specific numbers, I can only provide a reasoned estimate. Given the alignment of Adam's traits with the field of computer science, but also considering that many fields require high intelligence and problem-solving skills (e.g., mathematics, physics, engineering), I would estimate the posterior probability as moderate.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

This estimate reflects that while Adam's traits are suitable for computer science, they are not specific enough to make it a highly confident prediction among all possible fields.
