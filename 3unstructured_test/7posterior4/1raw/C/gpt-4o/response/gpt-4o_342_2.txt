To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence.

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact numerical value for \( P(H|E) \). However, we can reason about the value qualitatively based on the given information.

Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, is good at understanding abstract concepts, and was a graduate student, these traits align well with typical characteristics of a computer science student. Thus, while we cannot compute the exact value, we can suggest that the probability should be reasonably high.

Therefore, a reasonable educated guess for \( P(H|E) \) could be:
