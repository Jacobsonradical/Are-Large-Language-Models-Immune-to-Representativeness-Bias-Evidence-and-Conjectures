To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), we cannot compute a precise numerical value. Instead, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood based on the provided personality sketch.

In the given personality sketch (E), Adam:
- Shows genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Loves solving puzzles.
- Has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- Is highly intelligent and understands abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits align more with fields related to biology, environmental science, or psychological sciences rather than computer science. Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science (H) might be lower.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's assign a plausible posterior probability for the field of computer science:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value indicates a lower but not negligible likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science based on the provided traits.
