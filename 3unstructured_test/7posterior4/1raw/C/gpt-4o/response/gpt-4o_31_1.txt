To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior information and specific likelihoods, which we currently lack. We can start with the following general form of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \) represents the likelihood of observing the characteristics in E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the characteristics in E.

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we will have to make educated guesses based on the provided information. 
The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong appreciation for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, which could align with multiple fields. While these traits are not exclusive to computer science students, solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract concepts can be valuable in computer science. However, the traits related to nature and animals might lower the likelihood.

To proceed, we'll make the following assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) is fairly low because computer science students are a subset of all graduate students.
- \( P(E|H) \) is moderate, considering the logical reasoning and problem-solving aspects.
- \( P(E) \) is dictated by the commonality of these traits across all fields.

So, we might adjust our general feeling without specific data, as approximations are required:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

Again, this is a rough estimate and should be fine-tuned with specific data for better accuracy.
