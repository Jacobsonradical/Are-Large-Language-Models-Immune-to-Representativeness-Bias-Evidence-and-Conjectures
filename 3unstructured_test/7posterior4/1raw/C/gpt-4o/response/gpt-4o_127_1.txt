To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need a few pieces of information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that we would observe personality sketch \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence, or the total probability of observing personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make educated assumptions based on common knowledge and the given personality sketch.

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - In general, the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science can be considered moderate to high, given the popularity of the field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The personality traits described in sketch \( E \) (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) are somewhat less typical of a computer science student compared to a student in fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - The overall likelihood of observing the personality sketch among all graduate students can be considered.

Given that subjects like biology or environmental science seem more aligned with Adam's personality traits, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science might not be very high. We can, however, still provide a reasonable estimate based on this subjective analysis.

### Assumptive Calculation:

Let's make some reasonable assumptions to provide a value:

- Assume \( P(H) \) (prior probability for computer science): 0.2 (20%).
- Assume \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood for computer science): 0.1 (10%).
- Assume \( P(E) \) (overall evidence): Let's assume it's influenced by fields like biology or psychology, so let's approximate it as 0.5 (50%).

So, using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.02}{0.5} = 0.04
\]

Thus, our approximate posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is 0.04.
