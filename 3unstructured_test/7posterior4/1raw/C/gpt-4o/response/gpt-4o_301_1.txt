To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \) - the initial probability of each field of study, which we would need to guess or provide based on general data or assumptions.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of seeing personality sketch \( E \) given Adam is in field \( H \).
3. Evidence \( P(E) \) - the total probability of observing \( E \) over all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since actual prior probabilities and likelihoods for different fields cannot be derived directly from the given information, let's make reasonable assumptions:

- Let each field have an equal prior probability (\( P(H) \)).
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) can be estimated based on how well the personality sketch fits typical characteristics observed in that field.

Given Adam's described traits, particularly his curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and abstraction-handling capabilities, he fits more naturally into fields that align closely with these characteristics.

For the hypothesis "computer science":

- \( P(H) \): Assume an equal distribution among possible fields, so \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \), where \( N \) is the number of fields we consider. If there's no particular reason to narrow down the specific number of fields, let's take \( N \) to be a representative number, say 10.
  \( P(H_{cs}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \)

- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are strongly correlated with computer science. Curiosity and problem-solving also fit well, although his interest in nature and strong empathy might not be typical for the majority of computer science students.
  Estimate \( P(E_{cs}|H_{cs}) \) reasonably high, say 0.6.

- \( P(E) \): We'll sum up over the likelihoods for all fields (though this typically would require specific data, we approximate here for simplicity):

\[ P(E) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]
Assume the likelihoods for other fields are on average less fitting than for Computer Science. Suppose the average \( P(E|H_{other fields}) \) is 0.3.
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + \sum_{i=2}^{10} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.1 + 9 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.27 = 0.33 \]

Applying Bayes' rule now:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E_{cs}|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.33} \approx 0.18 \]

Thus, the probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, given the personality sketch, is approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.18
}
```

This value reflects a balanced estimation based on given characteristics and not an absolute measurement due to the approximations made.
