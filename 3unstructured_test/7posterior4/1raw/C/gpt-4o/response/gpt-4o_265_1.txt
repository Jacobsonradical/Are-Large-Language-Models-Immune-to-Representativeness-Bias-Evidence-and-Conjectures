To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute this rigorously, we need the following information:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Without specific numeric values for these probabilities, we can only provide a qualitative estimate based on common knowledge and typical characteristics of fields of study.

Given the information in the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- Is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

For computer science, we can assess:
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with many computer science activities such as algorithm design and problem-solving.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant for computer science.
- Empathy and a deep love for animals don't directly align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science student but don't preclude it either.

Considering these points, the posterior probability might not be very high, given the alignment with several but not all key traits traditional to computer science students.

A qualitative, not fully empirical estimate could look something like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

This value reflects a reasonable alignment with some traits common in computer science students without specific numeric data.
