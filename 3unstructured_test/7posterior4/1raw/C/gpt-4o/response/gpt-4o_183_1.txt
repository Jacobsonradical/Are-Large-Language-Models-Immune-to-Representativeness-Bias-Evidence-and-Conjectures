To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know several values including prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, in the absence of explicit numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods for different fields, an exact numerical value cannot be precisely computed. Instead, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest a leaning towards fields related to nature, cognitive challenges, and perhaps empathetic vocations. Based on this, computer science might be considered since it involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, though it is less directly tied to his love for nature and animals.

However, for the sake of the format you asked for and without precise numbers:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

This value is a qualitative estimate reflecting that while computer science matches some of Adam's traits related to intelligence and puzzle-solving, it is less aligned with his deep love for nature and animals compared to fields like biology or environmental science.
