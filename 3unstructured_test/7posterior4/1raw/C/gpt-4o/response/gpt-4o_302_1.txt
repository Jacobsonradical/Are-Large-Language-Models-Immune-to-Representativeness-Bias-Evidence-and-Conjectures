To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

If we don't have any existing data to precisely calculate these probabilities, we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

Adam's personality traits (interest in nature and plants, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work) might suggest a higher likelihood of fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology. However, computer science is also a field where high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.

Given these considerations, we will make some hypothetical assumptions for the probabilities:
- Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) of any graduate student being in computer science is 0.2 (since computer science is a popular field but not the only one).
- We might guess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's specific traits given he is in computer science to be lower, say 0.1, since some traits like a deep love for animals might be less common in this field.
- Without more context, we can assume \( P(E) \) based on the general frequency of these traits among all students; for simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) to be 0.05.

Now, we plug these into Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.05} = \frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4 \]

So the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is 0.4.

Hence, the answer in the required format is:
