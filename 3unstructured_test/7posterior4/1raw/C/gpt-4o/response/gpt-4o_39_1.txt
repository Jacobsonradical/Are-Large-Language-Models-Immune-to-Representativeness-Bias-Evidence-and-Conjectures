To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the evidence P(E). However, given the limited qualitative information, we can't compute exact numerical values. Despite this, we can make an educated guess based on Adam's personality sketch.

Adam's traits include curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, and an affinity for solving puzzles. These traits align more closely with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, rather than computer science. But since he has a strong understanding of abstract concepts and is good at solving puzzles, he might also be a good fit for computer science.

Let's estimate the value:

- Prior probability P(H) could be considered low because Adam's interests lean heavily towards nature and animals.
- The likelihood P(E|H) is moderate since skills in abstract reasoning and puzzle-solving are valuable in computer science.
- The evidence P(E) is normalized over all possible fields, but without specific details, we assume this to be a constant factor.

Given these qualitative assessments, an estimated posterior probability P(H|E) for Adam being in computer science would be on the lower side but not negligible.

So, based on these qualitative insights, an educated guess for P(H|E) is:
