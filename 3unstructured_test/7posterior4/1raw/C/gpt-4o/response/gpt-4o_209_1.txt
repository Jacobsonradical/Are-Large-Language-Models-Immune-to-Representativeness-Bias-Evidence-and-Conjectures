To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes’ rule, we need information about prior probabilities and likelihoods, which aren't provided in the problem. Assuming we had that information, the formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since this problem doesn't provide the necessary data to perform an exact computation, I can instead provide a qualitative analysis based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits:
- Curious about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted and empathetic
- Loves animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's assess how well these traits align with fields typically associated with computer science.

Computer science often attracts individuals who:
- Enjoy solving logical and abstract problems (Aligns with Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts)
- Have high intelligence (Aligns with Adam's high intelligence)
- Appreciate hard work and dedication (Aligns with Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication)

The traits specific to nature, plants, animals, and empathy are more commonly associated with fields like biology, environmental science, veterinary science, etc. They are not exclusive to computer science but are less directly associated with it.

Given this qualitative assessment, I would estimate that the alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the field of computer science is moderate to high, but not dominant.

Therefore, considering this qualitative evaluation, a plausible estimate for \( P(H|E) \) could be:
