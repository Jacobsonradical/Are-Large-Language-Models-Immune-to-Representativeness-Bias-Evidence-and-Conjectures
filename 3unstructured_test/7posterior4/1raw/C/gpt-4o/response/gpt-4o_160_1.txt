To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch given that he was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch, irrespective of the field of study.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll qualitatively assess and hypothesize the values based on the given personality sketch of Adam and common stereotypical traits associated with various fields of study.

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having the described personality traits if he were a computer science student.
    - While computer science students are generally characterized by high intelligence and good problem-solving skills, the specific traits about empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants are not typically associated with computer science majors.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is a moderate value, say 0.4.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam enrolling in computer science.
    - Assuming an average university environment, let's estimate the prior probability to be 0.2 (20%) for computer science since it is a popular field but not the most common.

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the personality sketch regardless of the field.
    - This would be difficult to estimate without more specific data, but since the personality described includes a mix of intellectual and empathetic traits, we'll assign a neutral value, say 0.5.

Thus, assuming these values, we get:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.08}{0.5} = 0.16 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.16.
