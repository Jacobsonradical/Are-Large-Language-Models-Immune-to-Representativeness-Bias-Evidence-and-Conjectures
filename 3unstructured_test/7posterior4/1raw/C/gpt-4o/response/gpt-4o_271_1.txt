To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, which is

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

we need the following components:

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
2. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. **\( P(E) \)**: The marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, to compute the exact numerical value, we would typically need empirical data regarding these probabilities, which is not provided. Therefore, I will make qualitative approximations based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with the field.

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Students in computer science are often highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, matching Adam's attributes.
   - However, there is no specific indication of a strong interest in puzzles or an explicit connection to computer science aside from intelligence.

   Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \).

2. **\( P(H) \)**:
   - Given that computer science is a common field for graduate students, let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   
   Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.15 \).

3. **\( P(E) \)**:
   - The marginal likelihood of the evidence, considering that Adam could be in other fields like biology or environmental science, which align better with his interest in nature and animals.

   Let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.2 \).

Using these approximations, we can compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.15}{0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the approximate posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch is:
