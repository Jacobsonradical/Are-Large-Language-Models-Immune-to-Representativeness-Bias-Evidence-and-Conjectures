Unfortunately, to accurately compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more specific information such as the prior probability of Adam enrolling in a field like computer science, the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch if he were enrolled in computer science, and the overall probability of having that personality sketch.

Since these specific probabilities (prior, likelihood, and evidence) are not provided, it's impossible to give a precise numerical answer. However, one might reason intuitively based on the personality sketch provided. Adam's strong appreciation for abstract concepts and his intelligence might suggest some compatibility with computer science, especially if he has a love for puzzles, which often align with programming and computational problem-solving.

Given these qualitative observations, we may infer that the value could be moderately high but without specific values, an exact probability cannot be computed.

To properly compute \( P(H|E) \), the following Bayes' rule formula is used:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being a computer science student.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch given he is a computer science student.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of having Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Without these values, we cannot provide a precise posterior probability.
