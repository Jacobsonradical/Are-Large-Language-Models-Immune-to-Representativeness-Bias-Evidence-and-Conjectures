To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in computer science, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasoned assumptions based on the information provided:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's attributes, it's possible to make an educated guess about whether a student with such a personality sketch would be enrolled in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance to computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance to computer science.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Low relevance to computer science.
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: High relevance to computer science.
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Neutral to slightly positive relevance to computer science.

Given the traits' mix, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science can be assumed based on general data about the popularity of different fields of study. Let's say computer science has a reasonable popularity among graduate students.
   - Assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality traits in \( E \) across all fields. This is difficult to estimate without details, but we can normalize it later. For now, assume:
   - \( P(E) = 1 \). (This simplifies calculations but avoids accurate proportion representations).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{1} = 0.06 \]

Therefore:
