To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of the evidence given that hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)), and the marginal likelihood of the evidence across all possible hypotheses (\( P(E) \)).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided in the problem. Given the personality sketch, we can qualitatively determine how likely it is that Adam's characteristics match someone in the field of computer science. 

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a strong love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.

Aspects such as enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might suggest a higher likelihood towards fields like computer science. On the other hand, his deep love for nature and animals might suggest fields like biology or environmental science.

Without exact numerical values but leveraging the qualitative information available in the personality sketch, we can provide a plausible value.

Given the qualitative match is moderate but not definitive for computer science, let's assign a posterior probability in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 for this field.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This value represents a reasoned estimate based on the given personality characteristics and typical profiles we might expect in computer science.
