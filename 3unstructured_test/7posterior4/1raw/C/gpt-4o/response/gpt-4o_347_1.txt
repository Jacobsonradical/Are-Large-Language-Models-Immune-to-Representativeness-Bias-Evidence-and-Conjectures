To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis H that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch E, we need several pieces of information:

1. **P(E|H)** - The probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch E) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
2. **P(H)** - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
3. **P(E)** - The overall probability of observing the evidence (personality sketch E) regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make qualitative assessments. Let's make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on typical characteristics of graduate students in various fields:

1. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's personality, which involves a deep love for nature, empathy, and solving puzzles, it is not entirely typical but still possible for a computer science student to exhibit such traits. Some areas of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, computational biology, and cognitive science, might attract individuals with such interests.
   
2. **P(H)**: The prior likelihood of a graduate student in the U.S. being in computer science is relatively high due to the popularity of the field.

3. **P(E)**: The probability of observing a student with Adam's personality traits is relatively indifferent across many fields but might be slightly lower in fields with less obvious connections to nature and empathy, such as computer science.

Despite these qualitative estimates, we lack the precise quantitative data to compute an exact probability. Instead, let's provide a reasonable estimation based on the given context:

\[
P(H|E) \approx \text{fairly moderate likelihood given his traits aligning partially but not completely with common characteristics of computer science students.}
\]
