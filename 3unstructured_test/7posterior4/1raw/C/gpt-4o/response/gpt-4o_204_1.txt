To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand and have data on several factors: the prior probability of Adam being in computer science, the likelihood of the observed personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), and the overall probability of the observed personality sketch across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit numerical data on these probabilities, we can only reason qualitatively based on the personality sketch.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's consider the base rate of students who major in computer science. Assuming this rate is relatively high due to the popularity of the field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The likelihood is the probability of the personality sketch being typical for a computer science student. Let's evaluate:
     - High intelligence: Valid for many computer science students.
     - Curiosity and solving puzzles: Strong indicators for a field involving problem-solving and abstract thinking, such as computer science.
     - Empathy and love for nature and animals: These traits are not particularly strong indicators for computer science but also not exclusive.
   
   Considering these aspects, the overall likelihood is moderate to high.

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing the personality sketch without any conditional hypothesis about the field. It's a normalization factor but is generally hard to specify without data. We intuitively assume it's consistent across various comparable fields.

Given the above qualitative analysis:

The subject has a curiosity about nature and plants, which might slightly push the likelihood away from pure computer science but doesn't completely rule it out. High intelligence and problem-solving fit well with computer science.

Thus, a reasonable posterior conditional probability considering these qualitative aspects could be estimated. However, due to the lack of precise quantitative data, let's assume it falls in a mid to moderate high range.

Given these considerations, the estimated value might look like this:

{
  "computer science": "0.5-0.7"
}

For simplicity, replacing the range with a single value:

{
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
