To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several factors, most notably the prior probability \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Given the information provided and considering the characteristics of Adam, we can make some educated estimates.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This is the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in computer science before knowing any specifics about him. We can estimate this based on the popularity of the field among graduate students.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were in computer science. Given his high intelligence and affinity for abstract concepts and puzzles, these traits are quite well-suited for a computer science student.

3. **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: This is the overall likelihood of these characteristics among all graduate students. It can be seen as a normalizing constant.

Without precise numerical data, we will make reasonable assumptions. Let's assume:

- \(P(H)\): The percentage of graduate students enrolled in computer science. Assume 20% (0.20).
- \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that a computer science student would have those characteristics. Since these traits fit well, let's assume 0.7.
- \(P(E)\): The overall likelihood of these characteristics among all graduate students. Since intelligence and a love for nature/animals/plants puzzles might not be specific, let's assume 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.20}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.35 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in computer science is:
