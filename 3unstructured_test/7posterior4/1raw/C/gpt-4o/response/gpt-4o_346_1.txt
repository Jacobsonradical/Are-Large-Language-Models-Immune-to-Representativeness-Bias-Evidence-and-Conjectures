To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in computer science using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, based on general knowledge.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute this precisely, we would need specific numerical values for \[ P(H), P(E|H), \text{ and } P(E) \]. In absence of specific data, we will make reasoned qualitative assumptions about Adam's fit for computer science based on his personality sketch:

- **P(H) for computer science**: The likelihood of any given graduate student being in computer science in the U.S. is moderate to high due to the popularity and growth of the field.
- **P(E|H) for computer science**: Considering Adam's traits:
  - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts: Strong match for computer science.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Also a good fit for computer science.
  - Quiet and introspective: Typical among many computer science students.
  - Curiosity about nature: While not directly aligning with computer science, related fields like computational biology exist.

Combining these observations suggests a fairly strong fit for computer science.

Without precise numerical data, our estimated \( P(H|E) \) for computer science is qualitative but consider the aforementioned favorable match.

So, our answer in the required format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```

This is based on educated reasoning that his curiosity in nature and intelligence would correlate well with fields within computer science, and many of his traits are favorable for the field.
