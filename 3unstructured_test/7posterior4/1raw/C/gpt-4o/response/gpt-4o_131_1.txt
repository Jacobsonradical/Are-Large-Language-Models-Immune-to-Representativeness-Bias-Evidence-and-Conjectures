To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \)) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science, the likelihood of his personality traits given that he is in computer science, and the overall probability of his personality traits.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having such personality traits given that he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam having such personality traits (across all fields).

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, specific numeric values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided in the question. Thus, any answer would be based on subjective estimation and domain knowledge about the likelihood of such personality traits amongst computer science students.

Considering typical characteristics of computer science students:
- Many computer science students have high intelligence and good problem-solving skills.
- However, a deep love for animals and nature, and strong empathy are less stereotypically associated with the field.

Given these considerations, we might subjectively estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

This value is purely an estimate based on the outlined traits and typical associations with the computer science field.
