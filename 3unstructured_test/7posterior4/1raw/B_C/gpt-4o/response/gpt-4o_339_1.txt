To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either business administration or computer science, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this context, we don't have specific numerical values to use for the priors \( P(H) \) (probability of being in each field), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (probability of the personality sketch given each field), or the evidence \( P(E) \) (total probability of the personality sketch). Therefore, we will make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

1. **Business Administration**: Generally, this field attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, entrepreneurship, and the dynamics of business operations. Adam’s traits such as a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication might align well with this field, but his deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles seems less typical for this domain.

2. **Computer Science**: This field is more likely to attract individuals with high intelligence who enjoy solving abstract problems and puzzles. Adam’s curiosity about nature and strong empathy might still align with interdisciplinary areas such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence in animal behavior analysis, or computational biology.

Given these assessments, we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities:

- **P(E|Business Administration)** would be lower since Adam's traits seem less aligned with this field.
- **P(E|Computer Science)** would be higher given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts.

Given that we don't have specific numerical probabilities, here are the qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect that it is more likely for Adam to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration based on his personality sketch. The remaining probability is allocated to other fields of specialization that are not considered here.
