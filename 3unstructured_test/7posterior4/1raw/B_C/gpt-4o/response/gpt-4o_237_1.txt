To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "business administration" or "computer science," we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field before considering the evidence \( E \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses. Since we don't know the total distribution of graduate fields or have absolute numbers, we'll leave \( P(E) \) as a normalization constant across different fields.

Given that we don't have exact prior probabilities or detailed likelihood functions for each field, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the nature of the evidence \( E \).

- **Business Administration**: Typically, a Business Administration program might attract students interested in leadership, organization management, and economics. While it's possible for someone with Adam's traits to be in this field, the evidence given doesn't strongly align with the typical nature of business studies.

- **Computer Science**: Students in this field often have a strong intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts well. Someone with a curiosity about nature and good understanding of hard work might also fit comfortably into this field, particularly in areas such as bioinformatics or algorithmic studies.

Given these assumptions, let's denote rough likelihood values to simplify \( P(E|H) \).

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Moderately unlikely, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Likely, say 0.7.

Without specific information on \( P(H) \), we'll assume priors \( P(H)\) are equal to each other for simplicity, say 0.5 for both fields.

Thus,

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Since the absolute values needn't sum to 1:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.35
