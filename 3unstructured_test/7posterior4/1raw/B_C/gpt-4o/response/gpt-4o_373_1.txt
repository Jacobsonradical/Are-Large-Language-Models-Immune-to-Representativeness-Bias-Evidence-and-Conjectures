To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given only the information in the problem (the personality sketch of Adam), let's make some qualitative judgments about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

### Hypothesis 1: H = "computer science"

**Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):** 
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Generally true.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Strongly consistent.
- Interest in solving puzzles: Very consistent.
- Quiet demeanor: Often consistent.
- Empathy and love for animals: Less relevant but not contradictory.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Less likely, more aligned with biology or environmental sciences.

**Qualitative Likelihood:** Moderate to High.

### Hypothesis 2: H = "business administration"

**Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \):**
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strongly consistent.
- High intelligence: Consistent.
- Quiet demeanor and solving puzzles: Less characteristic.
- Empathy and love for animals: Neutral.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Less likely.
- Interest in solving puzzles: Also less characteristic.

**Qualitative Likelihood:** Low to Moderate.

Given Adam's personality sketch, he seems more aligned with fields that value analytical and abstract thinking, such as computer science, rather than the more extroverted and managerial qualities often associated with business administration.

Since exact numerical probabilities are not provided, but based on the qualitative analysis above, we estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are not definitive and can vary with additional evidence or priors specific to Adam's circumstances or the general distribution of graduate students in these fields.
