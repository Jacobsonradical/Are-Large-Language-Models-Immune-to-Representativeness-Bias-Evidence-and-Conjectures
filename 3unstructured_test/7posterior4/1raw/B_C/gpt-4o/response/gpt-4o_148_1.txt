Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the posterior conditional probability by using the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given we do not have specific prior probabilities or detailed datasets on the likelihood of Adam possessing his attributes under specific fields, we will make reasonable qualitative judgments based on the personality sketch provided (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work).

Let's qualitatively reason the likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - This field might not conventionally align as well with Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Understanding abstract concepts and appreciation for hard work are relevant, but those traits are less defining for this field compared to the others like empathy and love for nature.

Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science aligns more closely with solving puzzles and high intelligence.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is highly pertinent in this field.
   - While empathy and love for animals might not directly correlate, computer science does foster a culture of problem-solving which suits Adam’s profile.

Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is relatively higher compared to business administration.

Using these qualitative assessments, with estimated assigning by reasonably inferred likelihoods, let us assume:
- Prior probabilities are equal for both fields for simplicity, \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \).

Thus:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

These numbers reflect the higher inferred suitability of Adam’s attributes for computer science over business administration, without exact numerical data.
