To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to handle the distributional assumptions and define the prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field. Given that we don't have explicit numerical values for prior distributions and likelihoods, we will make reasonable estimations based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

We will need to estimate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He values empathy, animals, and abstract concepts.
- He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Estimations**:
1. Business Administration (MBA):
   - Prior probability, \( P(\text{MBA}) \): This field generally attracts individuals with strong leadership, organizational, and business-oriented skills. We might assume \( P(\text{MBA}) \approx 0.15 \).
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|\text{MBA}) \): There is little in the description that explicitly points towards a business orientation. Adam's characteristics are less typical of a business student, so we might assume \( P(E|\text{MBA}) \approx 0.05 \).

2. Computer Science (CS):
   - Prior probability, \( P(\text{CS}) \): This is a popular field for analytically minded individuals. We might assume \( P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with CS. Thus, \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \).

To find \( P(E) \), we sum over all possible fields, but for simplicity, we'll consider just these two:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{MBA}) \cdot P(\text{MBA}) + P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.0075 + 0.06 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.0675 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{MBA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{MBA}) \cdot P(\text{MBA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{MBA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{0.0675} \]

\[ P(\text{MBA}|E) \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0675} \]

\[ P(\text{MBA}|E) \approx 0.111 \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.0675} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.0675} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.889 \]

Based on these calculations, we get the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.889
}
