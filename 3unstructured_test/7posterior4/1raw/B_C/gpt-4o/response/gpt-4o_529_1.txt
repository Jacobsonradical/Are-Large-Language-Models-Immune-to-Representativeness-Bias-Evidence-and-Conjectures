To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam in the fields of business administration and computer science given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule. This requires knowledge or estimates of the following probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \) - The probability of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field.
2. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
3. \( P(E) \) - The overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since precise numerical data for these probabilities is not provided, we can only make qualitative assessments and plausible estimates based on common expectations.

Let's identify the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- For business administration:
  - The personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are less characteristic of typical business administration students. They are more focused on human behavior in business contexts, leadership, and management skills.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) would be relatively low.

- For computer science:
  - Curiosity about solving puzzles is strongly aligned with computer science, as well as high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts. These traits are common among computer science students.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{comp_sci}) \) would be relatively high.

Next, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) could be assumed to have some base rates but they are not strictly given. Commonly, computer science might have a higher base rate due to the larger number of students entering that field compared to business administration, but this is speculative.

Given the above qualitative analysis, our plausible estimates might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These values imply that it is much more likely, given Adam's personality sketch, that he was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
