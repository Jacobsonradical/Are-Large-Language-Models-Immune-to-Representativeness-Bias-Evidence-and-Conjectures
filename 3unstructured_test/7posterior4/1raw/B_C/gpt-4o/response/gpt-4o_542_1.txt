To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without knowledge of the following:
1. Prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) of the evidence.

It is challenging to provide exact numerical values. Instead, we can make qualitative assessments regarding the likelihood of the given personality traits fitting the fields based on the information at hand.

Given Adam's personality and interests:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.

These traits may be more or less aligned with different fields:
1. **Computer Science**: This field often involves solving abstract problems and puzzles (positive indication). However, the strong empathy and curiosity for nature might not be directly aligned with the typical interests found in computer science, which are usually more technical and less focused on nature and animals.
2. **Business Administration**: Business administration requires an understanding of human behavior and empathy (positive indication). However, it might not typically involve solving abstract puzzles or direct curiosity about nature and plants.

Let's form hypotheses on how well these fit:

For computer science, the traits related to puzzle-solving and intelligence fit well, but curiosity about nature is less relevant:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be moderately high.

For business administration, empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well, but puzzle-solving and curiosity about nature are less relevant:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be moderately low.

Given this assessment, we might qualitatively estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values reflect an informed guess based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the core aspects of each field. The exact values would require precise data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
