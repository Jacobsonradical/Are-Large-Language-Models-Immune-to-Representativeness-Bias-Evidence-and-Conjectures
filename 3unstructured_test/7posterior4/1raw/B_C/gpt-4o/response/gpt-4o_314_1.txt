To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in specific fields given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's marginal probability, which can be calculated via summing up the probability of the evidence across all relevant hypotheses.

To solve this, we need reasonable estimates for these probabilities based on the information given and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Assumptions and Estimates
1. **Priors \(P(H)\):** This might be based on general distribution of graduate students across various fields. Let’s assume:
   - Prior probability for business administration (MBA) students: 0.20
   - Prior probability for computer science students: 0.15

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):** Based on Adam’s personality sketch:
   - Business Administration (MBA): Typically, this field is more about working with people, business strategies, and management. Adam's scientific curiosity and love for nature, empathy, intelligence, and puzzle-solving are less directly aligned. Thus, let's estimate:
     - \( P(E|H_{MBA}) = 0.05 \)
   - Computer Science: This field requires high intelligence, solving abstract problems, and patience, which fits Adam’s personality well. Therefore, let's estimate:
     - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.30 \)

3. **Marginal \(P(E)\):** This is harder to estimate directly without all possible graduate fields, but we can simplify for comparative purposes as follows:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{MBA})P(H_{MBA}) + P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + \dots \]

Where the dots represent other fields not explicitly defined here. For our context, we focus on normalizing for the two given fields:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{MBA})P(H_{MBA}) + P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.01 + 0.045 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.055 \]

### Calculation:
Now we can compute:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{MBA})P(H_{MBA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.20}{0.055} \]
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) \approx \frac{0.01}{0.055} \]
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) \approx 0.1818 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.055} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.055} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.8182 \]

### Answer:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1818,
  "computer science": 0.8182
}
```

These estimates indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is significantly more likely to have been enrolled in a computer science graduate program than a business administration program.
