To compute the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (P(H)) and the likelihood of observing his personality traits given each field (P(E|H)). Since these probabilities are not strictly provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions of students and their characteristics in various fields.

Let's assume the following prior probabilities (these are illustrative and not based on exact data):

- Prior probability for business administration (P(B)): 0.3
- Prior probability for computer science (P(C)): 0.4

Next, we estimate the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given each field of study. 

For Business Administration:
- A high appreciation for hard work and dedication is usually valued.
- Traits like empathy and a warm heart could be seen among some in business, particularly in areas like human resources or organizational behavior, but might not be strongly associated.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial, yet problem-solving of the nature described might not be central.

Let's assume:
P(E|B) = 0.2 

For Computer Science:
- Solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence are strongly associated.
- While empathy and a love for animals might be less directly relevant, they don't contradict common traits in the field.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is crucial.

Let's assume:
P(E|C) = 0.5 

To use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \), the overall probability of Adam's traits, is the same for both fields but is not strictly necessary for comparing probabilities between fields.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

We can simplify to only compare the numerators:
\[ P(B|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(C|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.4 = 0.2 \]

Normalizing these:
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.26} \approx 0.2308 \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.06 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{0.26} \approx 0.7692 \]

Therefore:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2308,
  "computer science": 0.7692
}
```

These values provide a way to assess the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality traits.
