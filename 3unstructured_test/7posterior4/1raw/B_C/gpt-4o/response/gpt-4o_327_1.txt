Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

To make an informed estimate, we need to consider the characteristics mentioned in Adam's personality sketch and how they align with students typically found in each of the fields mentioned. 

Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we can qualitatively assess how likely they would lead him into the said fields.

### Business Administration:
- Business administration often attracts individuals with strong leadership, communication, and organizational skills.
- Adam's profile emphasizes curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, which don't directly align with typical business administration skills and interests.
- Given these factors, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) seems low.

### Computer Science:
- Computer Science often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and understand abstract concepts.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with a computer science profile.
- Given these aligned interests, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) seems fairly high.

We assume that before any evidence, each field has an equal prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \). This simplifies our calculations by focusing on how well the evidence matches each field.

Let's call the matching degree for business administration as \( L_{\text{business}} \) and for computer science as \( L_{\text{CS}} \).

### Normalizing these:
Given that the total probability must sum up to 1 across all potential hypotheses, in a more comprehensive model, we would normalize these values by considering the likelihood of the evidence across all potential fields.

However, since we only compare two fields here, let's provide the likelihoods directly:

\[
L_{\text{business}} \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(lower likelihood matching ratio)}
\]
\[
L_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.7 \quad \text{(higher likelihood matching ratio)}
\]

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subject to the assumed likelihoods and an equal priori assumption. For more precision, they would be normalized considering all field likelihoods comprehensively.
