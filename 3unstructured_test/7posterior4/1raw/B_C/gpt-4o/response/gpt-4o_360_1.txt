To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \), which serves as a normalizing constant.

Let's define our terms for each field:

**1. Business Administration (H₁):**
- \( P(E|H₁) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is true given he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H₁) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.

**2. Computer Science (H₂):**
- \( P(E|H₂) \): The probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is true given he is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H₂) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.

Given Adam's personality traits, including curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and high intelligence:
- \( P(E|H₁) \): Graduate business students might be empathetic and intelligent, but traits like a deep love for animals and solving puzzles are less typical. Let's estimate this likelihood as relatively low.
- \( P(E|H₂) \): Computer science students might better align with traits involving puzzles and abstract thinking, with some probability for empathy and a love for animals, but not necessarily a curiosity for nature. Let's estimate this likelihood as moderate.

Given that we lack exact numeric priors, we'll use reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H₁) \approx 0.2 \): Assuming 20% of graduate students are in business administration.
- \( P(H₂) \approx 0.2 \): Assuming 20% of graduate students are in computer science (these are hypothetical prior probabilities).

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for \( P(E|H₁) \) and \( P(E|H₂) \):
- \( P(E|H₁) \approx 0.05 \): Lower likelihood due to mismatches.
- \( P(E|H₂) \approx 0.15 \): Moderate likelihood due to better alignment.

The normalizing constant \( P(E) \) can be complex to compute directly from this data without more fields but doesn't affect the ratios.

Therefore, using these estimates, Bayes' rule simplifies computing relative posteriors:

\[ P(H₁|E) \propto P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]

\[ P(H₂|E) \propto P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) = 0.15 \cdot 0.2 = 0.03 \]

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{P(H₂|E)}{P(H₁|E)} = \frac{0.03}{0.01} = 3 \]

Using the above, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.03
}
```

Note this doesn't sum to 1 because other fields aren't considered here explicitly. These numbers represent relative likelihoods given our assumptions and hypothetical priors.
