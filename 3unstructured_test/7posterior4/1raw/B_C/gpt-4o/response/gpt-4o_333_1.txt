To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need additional information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field. However, since we don't have that data, we can instead provide a qualitative assessment by considering how well Adam's personality matches typical profiles in each field.

Given Adam's attributes—curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, quiet demeanor, puzzle-solving enjoyment, and empathy—we can qualitatively assess the likelihood of each field based on this information.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with the skills needed for computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy and love for animals might not be as directly relevant.
   - Curious about nature can align with certain aspects of computer science, especially fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically involves more human-centric skills such as leadership, communication, and strategic decision-making.
   - Adam's empathy could be valuable in fields like human resources or organizational behavior.
   - However, his quiet demeanor and strong interest in nature and animals might suggest that this field aligns less perfectly with his sketch.

Considering these aspects, our qualitative assessment might be:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are purely speculative and qualitative due to the lack of specific priors and likelihoods.
