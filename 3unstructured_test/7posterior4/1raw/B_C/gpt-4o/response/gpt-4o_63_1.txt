To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) based on the personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only make a qualitative assessment rather than a precise quantitative one. Nonetheless, we can leverage the qualities described in the personality sketch to form a qualitative judgment on how well the fields match.

Given the traits in the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong empathy
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's qualitatively assess how likely Adam would fit into each field:

**Business Administration (H1)**
- While business administration requires dedication and hard work, it is less closely associated with a curiosity about nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving. Therefore, the traits aligned with empathy and dedication are present, but some other key traits are less emphasized in this field.

**Computer Science (H2)**
- Computer science strongly aligns with problem-solving skills, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for dedication. While it might not directly relate to curiosity about nature and animals, the subject's curiosity and problem-solving skills are well matched here.

Without actual numerical data for the prior probabilities and likelihood, a qualitative approach would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values qualitatively suggest that Adam is more likely to be in computer science given his personality traits, but not ruling out a significant possibility of being in business administration due to his appreciation for hard work and dedication.
