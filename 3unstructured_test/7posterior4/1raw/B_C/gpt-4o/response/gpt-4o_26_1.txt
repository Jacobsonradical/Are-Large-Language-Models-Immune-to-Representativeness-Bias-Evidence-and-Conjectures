To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field (computer science, business administration).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in each specific field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor and it is the same for both fields, we can compute relative probabilities without it, focusing on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Here we provide a conceptual outline for approximation, as actual prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) are not given and would require empirical data or expert judgement.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Priors: Computer science fields often attract individuals with high intelligence and an affinity for puzzles and abstract concepts.
   - Likelihood: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants does not strongly align with computer science, though his puzzle-solving intelligence does.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Priors: Business Administration is a versatile field attracting individuals from diverse backgrounds.
   - Likelihood: Though empathetic and understanding traits are valuable, Adam's specific interests in nature, plants, and animals don't especially align.

Given these conceptual assessments, we suggest:
- Higher likelihood for Computer Science due to alignment with abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.
- Lower likelihood for Business Administration given Adam's specified interests.

With an arbitrary preference for readability over precision, we offer:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
\]

This distribution reflects a stronger alignment of Adam's traits with a field like computer science over business administration but is vastly generalized. Further data would be needed to refine these approximations.
