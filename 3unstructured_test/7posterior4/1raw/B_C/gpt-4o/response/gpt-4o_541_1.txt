To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the likelihood of Adam having his described personality traits given that he is in a certain field, along with the prior probabilities of someone being in those fields. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of E.

To make a simplified estimation, we will make some assumptions for the likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science Hypothesis (H1):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \): Adam's traits of high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align fairly well with a computer science student.
   - Prior probability \( P(H1) \): Computer Science is a common field in graduate studies.
   
2. **Business Administration Hypothesis (H2):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \): Traits like understanding abstract concepts and strong appreciation for hard work fit, but strong empathy and deep love for animals might be less directly relevant.
   - Prior probability \( P(H2) \): Business Administration is also a common field.

Given reasonable prior probabilities for both fields (say, roughly equal for the sake of this estimation), we might assume \( P(H1) \approx P(H2) \). The key here is the likelihood:

- \( P(E|H1) \) (Computer Science): High, given that Adamâ€™s traits fit well.
- \( P(E|H2) \) (Business Administration): Moderate, as some traits align less directly.

Without exact data, we can provide a qualitative estimate:

\[ P(E) \] is a constant term for all hypotheses, so we can ignore it for this relative comparison.

Let's normalize values to add clarity:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

This reflects the assumption that Adam's traits are more typical for a student in Computer Science than in Business Administration. 

Note: These probabilities are qualitative and should ideally be informed by specific data about the graduate populations in each field.
