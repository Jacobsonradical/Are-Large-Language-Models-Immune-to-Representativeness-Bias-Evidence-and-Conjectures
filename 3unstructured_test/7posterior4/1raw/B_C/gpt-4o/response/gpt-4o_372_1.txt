To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that a given student is in a specific field before considering any personality traits.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability that someone in a specific field would have Adam's described personality traits.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of having Adam's personality traits, irrespective of the field of study.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Due to the lack of specific numerical data in the personality sketch, we'll need to rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate relative likelihoods and priors for each field based on typical correlations with the described traits.

### Step 1: Estimating Priors
Let's assume there are many fields of specialization and that prior probability is uniform (for simplicity in absence of specific data), meaning \( P(H) \) for any field is relatively low but equal.

### Step 2: Estimating Likelihoods

- **Business Administration**:
  - It is generally associated with skills like management, leadership, and business acumen.
  - Adam's traits, like empathy and appreciation for hard work, might be somewhat relevant, but his interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts are less directly applicable.
  - So, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively low.

- **Computer Science**:
  - This field highly values problem-solving skills, intelligence, and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
  - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with this field.
  - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be relatively higher.

### Step 3: Estimating Evidence

\( P(E) \) is common across all hypotheses and represents the overall likelihood of someone having Adam's personality traits across all fields. It essentially normalizes the posterior probabilities but for simplicity in this relative comparison, it can be seen as a scaling factor.

### Step 4: Calculating Posterior Probabilities

Given the qualitative assessment and Bayes' Rule, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

- **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{Low \cdot Uniform}{Common} = Low \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{High \cdot Uniform}{Common} = Higher \]

### Final Estimate

Although exact numeric values are hard to assign without specific data, these qualitative assessments give us relative probabilities. Let's assign some illustrative values:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates reflecting that Adam is qualitatively more aligned with computer science than business administration based on the given personality sketch.
