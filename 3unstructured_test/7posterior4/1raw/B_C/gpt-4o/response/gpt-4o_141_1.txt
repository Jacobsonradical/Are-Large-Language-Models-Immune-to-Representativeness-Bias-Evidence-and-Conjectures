To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

To make this calculation, we need to estimate each of these components. However, without specific statistical data, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and common associations with each field.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume that computer science and business administration are equally probable among graduate fields.
   - Let \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \) for simplicity.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Computer Science: Given Adam’s high intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of puzzles, we assign a moderately high probability to Adam being in computer science.
     - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \).
   - Business Administration: Given Adam’s warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, there is a reasonable but lower probability for business administration.
     - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - As it’s the sum of all possible likelihoods weighted by their priors, for simplicity we can normalize our results at the end.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization:
Let’s compute the unnormalized probabilities first:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \]

### Normalized Probabilities:
Since we are only comparing two hypotheses, we can normalize them as follows:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.15} = \frac{0.3}{0.45} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.3 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.45} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

These probabilities reflect the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each respective field based on his personality traits.
