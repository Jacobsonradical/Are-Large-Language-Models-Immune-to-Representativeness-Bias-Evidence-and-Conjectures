To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Here's Bayes’ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, making an exact computation is challenging. However, we can qualitatively assess how likely Adam's personality sketch (E) matches each field (H).

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: This attribute does not strongly correlate with computer science directly but doesn’t exclude it.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: This aligns well with computer science, as the field often involves problem-solving and logical thinking.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: A strong fit for computer science, which requires abstract thinking.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: A general positive trait for any demanding field, including computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: This attribute seems less relevant for business administration.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: This can align with business strategies and economic models, though less strongly than with computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant but business administration typically also requires strong social and practical skills.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Valuable in business administration as well; likely more about management and building teams.

Given these qualitative assessments:

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Assumptions/Estimates**:
- For computer science, let’s say there’s a good fit given the puzzle-solving and abstract thinking aspects.
- For business administration, the fit seems moderate.

The prior \( P(H) \) typically would be given, or based on general academic demographics. Here, we assume equal priors as no specific information is provided.

**Qualitative Estimates**:
Given the qualitative fit:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on qualitative alignment with Adam's personality traits as described. The exact values could be different with more precise data on likeliness and departmental enrollment statistics.
