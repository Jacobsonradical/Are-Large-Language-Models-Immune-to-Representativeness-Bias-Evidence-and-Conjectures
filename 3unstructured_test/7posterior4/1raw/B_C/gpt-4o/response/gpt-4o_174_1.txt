Bayes' rule is used to compute the posterior conditional probability, and it can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality traits and interests of Adam, we'll qualitatively assess how these traits align with different fields.

**For business administration:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not very relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Can be somewhat relevant, but not a primary trait for this field.
- Warm heart and empathy: Somewhat relevant in leadership and HR roles, but not central to business administration.
- Love for animals: Not very relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant, but many fields require this.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Very relevant.

Given these traits are not strong indicators of a typical business administration student, the likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \) for business administration would be relatively low. Without exact numerical values for probabilities, we can provide a qualitative estimate.

**For computer science:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not directly relevant, but curiosity is a good trait.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
- Warm heart and empathy: Not traditionally associated with the field but beneficial for collaborative work.
- Love for animals: Not relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Very relevant.

These traits are more aligned with the typical traits seen in a computer science student, so the likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \) for computer science would be relatively higher.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,  // Lower likelihood based on traits alignment
  "computer science": 0.6          // Higher likelihood based on traits alignment
}

Note: These values are qualitative estimates meant to demonstrate the thought process and would require exact prior probabilities and more specific data for precise calculation.
