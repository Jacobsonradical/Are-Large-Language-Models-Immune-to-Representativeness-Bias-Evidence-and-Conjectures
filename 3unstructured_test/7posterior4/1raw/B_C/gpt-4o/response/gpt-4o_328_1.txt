To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "business administration" and "computer science," given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we are given the personality sketch \( E \) and not explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll need to make educated estimations based on typical characteristics associated with the fields.

### Field: Business Administration

1. **P(E|H: Business Administration)**: People in business administration often have interest in business concepts, leadership, and management. They may not strongly align with Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and abstract puzzles (though it's not impossible).

   Estimation: Low likelihood, perhaps around 0.1 (10%).

2. **P(H: Business Administration)**: Given the numbers of students in the U.S., business administration is a common field. Assume a prior probability of around 0.2 (20%).

### Field: Computer Science

1. **P(E|H: Computer Science)**: In computer science, there's a higher likelihood for individuals to appreciate puzzles, abstract concepts, and even nature (given interests in algorithms for environmental modeling, etc.). Computer scientists often have strong logical skills and sometimes a quieter personality.

   Estimation: Higher likelihood, say around 0.5 (50%).

2. **P(H: Computer Science)**: Computer science is also a popular field, especially given rising demands. Prior probability could be around 0.3 (30%).

### Calculations:

We need the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which can be considered as a normalization factor for our two hypotheses. However, without pen and paper, we'll just focus on relative comparison without explicit formulas:

For both hypotheses:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus, for each hypothesis:

- **Business administration**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

- **Computer science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

We can normalize to compare:

Total = \(0.02 + 0.15 = 0.17\)

Normalized:

\[ P(H=\text{Business administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.1176 \]

\[ P(H=\text{Computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.17} \approx 0.8824 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities approximations are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1176,
  "computer science": 0.8824
}
