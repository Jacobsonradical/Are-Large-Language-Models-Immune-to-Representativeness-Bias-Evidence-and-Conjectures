To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) for each field given Adam's personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability for each field.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in that field.
- P(H) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field (prior belief before seeing the personality sketch).
- P(E) is the evidence, which is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

However, without specific numerical values for P(E|H), P(H), and P(E), we need to rely on qualitative judgment based on the information provided.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, coupled with high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, we can qualitatively assess the fit for:

1. Business Administration: This field typically focuses on organizational, financial, and managerial aspects, which may not strongly align with Adam’s love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
2. Computer Science: This field often requires solving abstract problems and puzzles, which aligns well with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the likelihoods can be proposed as follows:
- P(E|H_business administration) might be relatively lower.
- P(E|H_computer science) would be relatively higher.

The prior probabilities (P(H)) are generally unknown, so we will assume them to be equally likely for simplicity unless other information is given. The evidence P(E) can be considered a normalizing factor.

Understanding there are other fields not evaluated here, we could assign:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

This suggests that given Adam’s personality traits and interests, it is more likely that he is enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
