To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities and likelihoods. Since these values are not specifically provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For illustrative purposes, let's make some assumptions:

- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is a Computer Science student.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is a Business Administration student.

Given the personality sketch, we may reasonably assume:

- People in Computer Science (CS) may have high intelligence and good abstract thinking skills, and they might enjoy solving puzzles.
- People in Business Administration (BA) might also appreciate hard work and dedication, but empathy and a love for nature/animals might be less indicative.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (30% of graduate students might be in CS)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students might be in BA)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \) (High likelihood that Adam fits the CS profile)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \) (Low likelihood that Adam fits the BA profile)
- \( P(E) \): This is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch of Adam, which we'll normalize later on.

Using these assumptions, we can calculate:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and we're interested in the relative probabilities, we can treat \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.02 \]

Normalizing these to sum to 1 for the given fields:

Sum of all proportional probabilities:
\[ 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.2 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.2} = 0.9 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.2} = 0.1 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.1
