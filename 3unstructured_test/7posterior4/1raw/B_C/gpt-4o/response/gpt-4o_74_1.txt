To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the components needed for this computation:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field \( H \). 
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields. Since we do not need the overall normalization, we can focus on the relative probabilities.

We'll have to make some educated guesses for these probabilities based on typical characteristics of students in each field. 

**For Business Administration \( H_{BA} \)**:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): A student in business administration could have characteristics such as high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, but a strong curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less typical.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume business administration has a broad appeal and is quite popular.

**For Computer Science \( H_{CS} \)**:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The traits of high intelligence, enjoying puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with typical computer science students.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer science is increasingly popular and sees many students with characteristics similar to Adam's.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume it's relatively high, say 0.2 (20%).
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Also quite high, let's say 0.15 (15%).

Based on the personality traits:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low probability, say 0.05 (5%), as these traits are less typical for this field.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Higher probability, say 0.3 (30%), as these traits are more aligned with this field.

Finally, normalizing constants will not be calculated as requested:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \textbf{0.01} \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \textbf{0.045} \)
}

Normalizing:
- Relative to each other, ignoring the exact normalization, we can see the probabilities imply a higher likelihood for computer science over business administration given Adam's personality sketch.

Thus, in final format:
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.045
}
