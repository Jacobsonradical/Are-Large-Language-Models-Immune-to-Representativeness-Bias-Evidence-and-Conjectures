To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The general distribution of graduate students across different fields. However, this isn't provided in the prompt, so we'll have to assume generic equal priors for simplification unless other specific information is given.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in either computer science or business administration. Here, we utilize clues from Adam's personality traits to estimate these probabilities.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \). For our purposes, we'll ignore this as it acts as a normalizing constant.

Given:
- Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
- High empathy and love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Estimations:
**Computer Science:**
- Enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence favor computer science.
- Abstract thinking aligns well with computer science.
- Curiosity about nature/plants and empathy/love for animals slightly less so.

**Business Administration:**
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is aligned with business administration.
- High intelligence is favorable but connection to nature and animals is less relevant.
- Empathy could be somewhat relevant but not a major driver in business administration.

Considering these points, we make the following relative likelihood assignments:

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (for computer science): 0.7
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) (for business administration): 0.3

Using Bayes' Rule and assuming equal priors \((P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{ba}) = 0.5)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and we assume equal priors:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \]

Normalizing these:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3 \]
