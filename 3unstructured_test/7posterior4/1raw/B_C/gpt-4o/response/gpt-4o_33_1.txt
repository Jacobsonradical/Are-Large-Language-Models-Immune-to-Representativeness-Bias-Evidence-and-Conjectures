To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):** These are the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field before we consider his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):** These are the probabilities of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each of the fields.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):** This is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, considering all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical probabilities for these components, we must make estimates based on general knowledge and the information given in the personality sketch.

### Estimating Relative Prospects:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: High, as computer science is a popular field for graduate students in the U.S.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles, it seems quite plausible that someone with Adam's personality might be in computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, as business administration is also a common choice.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Lower chances, given that Adam's personality sketch suggests a focus on nature, animals, and empathy, which are not core focuses of business administration studies.

### Probabilistic Estimations:
Let's arbitrarily assign prior probabilities based on subjective estimates and then adjust for the personality fit:
- Prior for Computer Science (\(P(H_{CS})\)): 0.30
- Prior for Business Administration (\(P(H_{BA})\)): 0.25

Likelihoods based on the personality sketch:
- Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\) given fit: 0.80
- Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\) given less fit: 0.20

Normalizing over all potential fields including but not limited to Computer Science and Business Administration:

The evidence \( P(E) \) would be calculated by summing across all fields, but only estimating for these two:
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \cdot 0.80 + 0.25 \cdot 0.20 \]

Thus:
\[ P(E) = 0.24 + 0.05 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.30}{0.29} \approx 0.83 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.25}{0.29} \approx 0.17 \]

Therefore, our estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.83,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
```
