To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we'd typically need information on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Since this information isn't provided, making precise numerical computations isn't feasible. However, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information in the sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication
  
It seems that Adam's interests and traits align more closely with fields that involve curiosity, understanding complex systems, and possibly working with natural environments or animals. Here is an assessment based on this reasoning:

**Computer Science:**
Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly related to computer science.

**Business Administration:**
Business administration involves dedication and appreciation for hard work, which aligns with some of Adam's characteristics. However, it is generally less aligned with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving abstract puzzles.

From a qualitative perspective, this might be represented as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
These values are speculative and based on qualitative matches rather than exact calculations due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood probabilities.
