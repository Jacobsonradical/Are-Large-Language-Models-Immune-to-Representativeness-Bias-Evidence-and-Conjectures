To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions about the problem. Here's a simplified approach:

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

We need to estimate the following:
1. **Prior probabilities**, \( P(H) \), for each field.
2. **Likelihood**, \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of Adam's personality given he's in each field.

Here are rational estimates:
- Prior probabilities: Assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is relatively uniform across various graduate fields since we don't have specific data.
- Likelihood: Estimate how likely Adam's personality traits fit each field based on the sketch.

Let's denote the fields we're considering (business administration and computer science) with their respective hypotheses \( H_{BA} \) and \( H_{CS} \). 

Estimate prior probabilities \( P(H) \) assuming roughly uniform chances across different graduate fields (since exact priors are not available).

Assuming 10 primary graduate fields equally likely, the prior for each:

\[ P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \]

Estimate likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) given Adam's personality traits:

- For **business administration**:
  - Possible traits fit: Empathy, understanding of hard work.
  - Unlikely traits: Curiosity about nature, strong appreciation for animals, solving puzzles.
  
  Rough likelihood: \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \) (lower due to less fitting traits)

- For **computer science**:
  - Possible traits fit: Intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts.
  - Less strongly fitting traits: Curiosity about nature and animals (though not strictly excluding).

  Rough likelihood: \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \) (higher due to better fitting traits)

The marginal probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + ... \text{(similar terms for other fields)} \]

For simplicity, consider just these two fields for marginal probability estimate (we normalize later):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \times 0.1) + (0.6 \times 0.1) = 0.02 + 0.06 = 0.08 \]

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.1}{0.08} = \frac{0.02}{0.08} = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \times P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{0.08} = \frac{0.06}{0.08} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
