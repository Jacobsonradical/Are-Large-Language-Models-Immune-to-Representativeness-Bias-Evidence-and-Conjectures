To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide precise numerical values, we would need detailed prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have specific data, I'll estimate the probabilities based on the information given about Adam's personality and typical qualities associated with each field.

First, let's consider some qualitative reasoning:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration often involves a focus on management, finance, operations, and leadership. While empathy and understanding hard work are useful, these fields might not be as closely aligned with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy toward animals, and interest in abstract concepts.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science could be a more fitting field due to his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. High intelligence and analytical skills are crucial in computer science, attributes that align more closely with the personality profile provided.

Given this qualitative reasoning, we can make a subjective approximation:

\[ P(E|H_{business\ administration}) = 0.2 \] (lower likelihood given a less direct connection)
\[ P(E|H_{computer\ science}) = 0.7 \] (higher likelihood given a closer match)
\[ P(H_{business\ administration}) \approx 0.3 \] (subjective prior probability, assuming business programs are common but not highly specialized for Adam's traits)
\[ P(H_{computer\ science}) \approx 0.4 \] (subjective prior probability, reflecting that many students choose this high-demand field)
\[ P(E) \] would be constant across all considered fields, but since we're focusing on the comparison, we can normalize this out in relative terms.

Using these estimates:

\[ P(H_{business\ administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{computer\ science}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.28}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing these relative probabilities (by dividing each by their sum):

\[ P(H_{business\ administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.28} = \frac{0.06}{0.34} \approx 0.176 \]
\[ P(H_{computer\ science}|E) \approx \frac{0.28}{0.06 + 0.28} = \frac{0.28}{0.34} \approx 0.824 \]

So, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "computer science": 0.824
}
```
