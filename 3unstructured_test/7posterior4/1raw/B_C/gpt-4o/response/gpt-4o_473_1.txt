To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need the following information:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability of each hypothesis without considering the evidence.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Normalization factor** \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence under all hypotheses.

Bayes' rule can then be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, I'll make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the typical traits associated with various fields of study.

### Qualitative Assessments:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior** \( P(H_{BA}) \): Medium. Many people pursue business administration, but it doesn't directly align with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low. Business administration may not strongly align with Adam's love for nature, empathy, and solving puzzles.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior** \( P(H_{CS}) \): Medium-High. Computer Science is a popular field with many graduate students.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Relatively high. Computer Science often involves solving puzzles (e.g., algorithms, coding), and a high level of intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts is beneficial in this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, I will provide the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

**Note**: These are illustrative qualitative estimates. In a rigorous mathematical approach, you would require specific numerical data for the priors and likelihoods to compute the precise posterior probabilities.
