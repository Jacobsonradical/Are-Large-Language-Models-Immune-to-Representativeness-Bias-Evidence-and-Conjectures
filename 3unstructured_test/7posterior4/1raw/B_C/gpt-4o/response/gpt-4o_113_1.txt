To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for the fields of computer science and business administration, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits a typical student in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of encountering Adam's personality sketch.

Since we don't have specific data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we need to make some assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in these programs and typical enrollment distributions. For simplicity, we'll assume equal prior probabilities for enrolling in either field, and focus primarily on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field.

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Curiosity about nature doesn't directly correlate but isn't a deterrent.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, which is a strong positive indicator.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
   - Empathy and love for animals are not typical but not exclusive traits for CS.

   We'll assume:
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \) (Adam fits well but not perfectly)
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \) (assuming equal distribution initially)

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Curiosity about nature doesn't correlate strongly.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles is beneficial but less central than in CS.
   - High intelligence is positive but not specifically an indicator.
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well.
   - Love for animals doesn't correlate strongly.

   We'll assume:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \) (Adam fits moderately well)
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.5 \) (assuming equal distribution initially)

For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant that doesn't significantly alter proportional differences.

Now, applying Bayes' rule proportionally:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Normalizing these to equivalent proportions (just focusing on their relative strengths):

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.5"
}

Please note, these are not exact probabilities but rather proportional indications based on the personality traits described. The exact probabilities would require detailed prior and likelihood data.
