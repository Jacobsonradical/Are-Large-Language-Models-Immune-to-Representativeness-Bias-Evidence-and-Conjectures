To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since we do not have specific numbers for these values, we will have to make some educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch and his alignment with each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \) as the given personality sketch of Adam.

We will estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's traits match each field and also use some guessed prior probabilities for each field to compute the posterior probabilities:

### Business Administration

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciates hard work. These traits are not typically highlighted for a business administration student.
- However, empathy and understanding abstract concepts might be somewhat relevant.

Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \):
- Let's assume a lower likelihood because the traits fit less well with typical business administration skills.
- Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)

Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \):
- Assume the probability of any graduate student being enrolled in business administration isn't extremely high.
- Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Computer Science

- Traits like enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts strongly align with computer science.
- High intelligence is also a match for the field.

Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):
- Let's assume a higher likelihood because the traits fit well with typical computer science skills.
- Estimate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.8 \)

Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \):
- Generally, computer science is a popular graduate field.
- Estimate: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Computation

Using these estimates, we compute:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24}{P(E)} \]

Since \( \frac{P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)} = \frac{0.04}{0.24} = \frac{1}{6} \):
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.04 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.24 \]

Providing rough values that do not need to add up to 1:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.24
}
```

This estimation assumes equal weighting of the prior probabilities and likelihood ratios without knowing the true values of \( P(E) \).
