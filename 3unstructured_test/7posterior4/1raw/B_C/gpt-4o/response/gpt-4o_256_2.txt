To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the likelihood of the hypothesis given the evidence, along with any prior probabilities and normalizing constants. 

Bayesâ€™ rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which acts as a normalizing constant.

Since I don't have specific statistical priors or the exact calculations for the likelihood of these hypotheses in real-world scenarios, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the given evidence (E):

1. Adam's traits that might influence the likelihoods for computer science:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science requirements.
   - Puzzle-solving ability is also positively related to skills needed in computer science.
   
2. Adam's traits that might influence the likelihoods for business administration:
   - Strong empathy and warm heart are valued in human-oriented fields including business administration.
   - An appreciation for hard work and dedication can be aligned with the rigors of a business program.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign the posterior probabilities based on how well Adam's characteristics match each field. Without numerical priors, we rely on judgment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This qualitative judgment places a higher likelihood on computer science because Adam's high intelligence, abstract conceptual understanding, and puzzle-solving skills align more strongly with the typical profile of a computer science graduate student. Conversely, while empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business administration, they do not outweigh the alignment with computer science in this scenario.
