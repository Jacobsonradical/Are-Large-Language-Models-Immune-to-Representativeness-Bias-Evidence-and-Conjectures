To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods, which are not provided in the prompt. However, since we do not have these exact values, I will make educated estimates based on the given personality traits and the likelihoods that those traits align with the fields mentioned.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without exact values, we can qualitatively assess the alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field.

1. Business Administration (BA):
   - Typical traits for a BA student might include leadership, communication, and interest in economics and management.
   - Although high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are useful in BA, Adam's strong empathy, love for nature, and animals, and preference for puzzles suggest a possible misalignment.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be lower because Adam's characteristics align better with fields related to nature or analytical problem solving.

2. Computer Science (CS):
   - Typical traits for a CS student include problem-solving ability, understanding abstract concepts, and often an appreciation for puzzles and analytical thinking.
   - Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts highly align with CS.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be higher because these traits are commonly seen in students pursuing CS.

Given these qualitative assessments, we assign higher posterior probabilities to fields that more closely match Adam's traits:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits with the necessary skills and interests typical in these fields. Actual Bayesian computation would require detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods.
