To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field, and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)â€”the probabilities of observing Adam's personality sketch given his enrollment in each field. Since these values are not provided, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch and general knowledge of the fields.

Here's Bayes' rule for context:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:
1. General prior probabilities \( P(H) \) may be somewhat uniform initially because we don't have specific data to influence priors. For simplicity, let's assume they are equal.
2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) can be estimated based on the characteristics typically associated with students in each field.

**Business Administration:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Business administration students may possess qualities such as high intelligence and an understanding of hard work and dedication. However, a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles may be less common.
  
  Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \).

**Computer Science:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles. A quiet demeanor, curiosity about abstract concepts, and empathy are also fairly compatible with the field.

  Estimate: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

### Posterior Probability Estimates:
Since exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the overall probability \( P(E) \) do not change proportionally for these estimates (and for simplicity, given our assumptions that they are initially equal):

\[
\text{Normalized posterior} \approx P(E|H) \, \text{for comparison purposes}
\]

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These approximate values suggest that, based on the personality sketch, it's more likely Adam was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration.
