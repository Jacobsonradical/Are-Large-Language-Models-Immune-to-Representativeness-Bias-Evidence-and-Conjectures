To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, without specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we can't compute the exact probabilities. Instead, we'll qualitatively assess the fit of each hypothesis to the given personality sketch \( E \). 

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior probability \( P(H) \):** Generally, this field has many students and is quite popular.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Subjects studying business administration might have intelligence and good abstract thinking, but the specific traits like strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are less strongly associated with this field.
   
2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior probability \( P(H) \):** This is also a popular field with a significant number of graduate students.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant. Enjoyment of solving puzzles fits well with problem-solving in computer science. Curiosity about nature could translate to interest in fields like AI, bioinformatics, or computational biology, but empathy and love for animals are less directly related.

Based on qualitative reasoning, it appears that the personality traits of Adam align more closely with computer science than business administration.

Given that we don't have exact values, we can assign rough estimates based on the qualitative fit:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

These values indicate that, while both probabilities are uncertain, Adam's personality sketch fits better with computer science than with business administration based on the given traits.
