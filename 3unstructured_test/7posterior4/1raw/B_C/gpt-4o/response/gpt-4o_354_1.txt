To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field of enrollment. However, without specific priors or detailed likelihood functions, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
- **Prior Probability:** Based on general statistics, we can assume that the number of students in computer science and business administration programs are somewhat comparable.
- **Likelihood Functions:** Adam's attributes such as empathy, love for animals, solving puzzles, and appreciating hard work may influence the likelihood in differing ways.

Given these assumptions, let's estimate the likelihoods for each field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking are strong indicators for a fit in computer science.
   - Solving puzzles, enjoying challenges, and curiosity about nature can also align well with computer science research and work.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work can be relevant in business.
   - However, attributes like a deep love for animals seem less directly relevant.
   - The quiet and introspective nature may not be as typical for business administration compared to fields that require high interaction and extroversion.

### Computation using Bayes' Rule:
Without specific prior probabilities or precise likelihood values, we will make educated guesses based on the descriptions given.

For simplicity, let's assign the following normalized likelihoods:
- **Computer Science:** \( Likelihood(E | H_{CS}) = 0.7 \)
- **Business Administration:** \( Likelihood(E | H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

Given these assumptions, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field can be estimated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This estimation suggests that based on the personality sketch, Adam has a higher probability of being enrolled in computer science over business administration.
