To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \)

Given that specific numerical data for the priors and likelihoods are not provided, I will use logical reasoning to estimate the probabilities. Please note that these values are only illustrative:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)) might be relatively lower for someone with Adam's personality sketch focused on nature, animals, and puzzles.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)) might be low, as Adam's qualities fit less with typical business administration traits.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)) might be higher given Adam's qualities like high intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)) might be high, as these traits are well-aligned with typical computer science characteristics.

Using this qualitative reasoning, let's assign illustrative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Explanation:
- Business Administration: Given Adam's traits, it's less likely he's studying business, thus a low probability (0.1).
- Computer Science: Traits like intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science, hence a higher probability (0.6).
