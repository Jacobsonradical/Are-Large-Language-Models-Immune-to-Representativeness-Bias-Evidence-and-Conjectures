To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we do not have specific data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we will qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) based on the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and abstract concepts might make computer science a plausible field.
   - The problem-solving characteristic aligns well with computer science.
   - However, strong empathy and dedication are not uniquely indicative of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication are strong fits for business administration.
   - Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less directly relevant to this field.

Given these qualitative observations, we can infer the following relative likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- **Computer Science**: High relevance due to problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- **Business Administration**: Moderate relevance due to empathy and dedication but lower fit for puzzles and nature curiosity.

In the absence of specific prior probabilities, let's assume the prior \( P(H) \) for both fields is approximately equal. Therefore, the posterior probabilities will be primarily influenced by the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

### Qualitative Posterior Probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}

These values suggest a stronger likelihood for computer science given Adam's personality sketch, while business administration is also plausible but less strongly indicated. Note that these are qualitative estimates.
