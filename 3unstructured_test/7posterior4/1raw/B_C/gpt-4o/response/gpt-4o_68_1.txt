To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \(P(E)\): The total probability of observing the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Since we do not have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration:
- Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance to business administration.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Could be somewhat relevant in strategic planning but not strongly so.
  - Warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals: Less relevant as these traits are not typically emphasized in business admin.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant, but more generally than specifically.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant, but generally applicable.

Overall, \(P(E|H)\) for Business Administration seems to be quite low to moderate.

### Computer Science:
- Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Not directly relevant, but curiosity is a good trait for research.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant, as computer science often involves complex problem-solving.
  - Warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals: Neutral to slightly positive if he is interested in fields like bioinformatics or AI for good.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant, computer science often involves dealing with abstract problems.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Highly relevant, as the field requires these traits.

Overall, \(P(E|H)\) for Computer Science appears to be high.

Without precise numerical values, let's infer relative probabilities based on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

This assessment suggests that it is significantly more likely for Adam to be enrolled in a computer science program compared to a business administration program, given his personality sketch.
