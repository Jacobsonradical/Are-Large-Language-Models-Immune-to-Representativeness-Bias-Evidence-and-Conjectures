To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration and computer science) given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Unfortunately, the exact numerical values for these probabilities are not given, so we need to make subjective estimates based on Adam's personality sketch. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given the field of study.
2. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of enrolling in each respective field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which can be seen as a normalizing constant but is the same for all hypotheses.

Given Adam's traits, let's qualitatively estimate:

### For Business Administration:
- **P(E|H):** Adam is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work. While some of these traits can be relevant in business administration, they are not core to the typical business admin focus.
- **P(H):** The prior probability might be relatively average compared to other fields.

### For Computer Science:
- **P(E|H):** Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts aligns strongly with computer science.
- **P(H):** The prior probability might be higher because many students enroll in computer science due to its popularity and demand.

Taking these qualitative assessments and applying them to the Bayes' rule framework, we can make an educated guess for the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.7
\]

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality traits, it is more likely he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration. 

So the answer can be formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these are subjective estimates and the actual probabilities can vary based on more detailed information or statistical data.
