To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express it in the following way:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute the actual values of \( P(H|E) \), we would need the following pieces of information:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) overall.

Since we lack specific numerical data and can only infer based on the traits described, we can make reasoned estimates based on qualitative understanding.

### For Computer Science:

- Adam's traits such as "high intelligence," "good at understanding abstract concepts," and "enjoying solving puzzles" align well with qualities beneficial in computer science. Given these attributes:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is likely high.
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) can be considered moderate to high given the popularity and enrollment in computer science.

### For Business Administration:

- Adam's "warm heart," "strong empathy," and "deep love for animals" are not typical traits strongly associated with business administration standard profiles, which usually emphasize skills in leadership, finance, strategic thinking, etc. However, understanding and appreciation for "hard work and dedication" may still align well.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) would be lower compared to computer science due to less direct alignment.
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) may be considered moderate due to the wide range of individuals who might enroll in business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can suggest that:

- For Computer Science: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) would be higher than for Business Administration considering the strong alignment of personal traits.
- For Business Administration: \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \) would be lower, reflecting weaker alignment.

Expressing these in estimated probabilities, where values are between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are illustrative estimates based on the qualitative assessment of the described traits and likely alignment with the fields. For precise probabilities, detailed statistical data and more rigorous computational analysis would be required.
