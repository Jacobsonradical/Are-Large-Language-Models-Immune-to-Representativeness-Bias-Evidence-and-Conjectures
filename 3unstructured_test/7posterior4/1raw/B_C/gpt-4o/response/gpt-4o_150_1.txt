To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the probability of each hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E), which is the personality sketch of Adam. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide qualitative assessments based on the information given. Below is a reasonable estimation based on the personality traits described and the typical characteristics associated with each field.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys puzzles: These traits align well with a computer science background.
   - Curiosity about nature can be linked to interests in algorithms, artificial intelligence, or bioinformatics.
   - Posterior probability should be relatively high, but we don't have concrete numbers to work with.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is certainly a fit for business administration.
   - However, there is less emphasis on abstract concepts or solving puzzles directly tied to business administration in the personality sketch, making this hypothesis a bit less likely than computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide the following reasonable estimations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are chosen to reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personal traits with the field of computer science compared to business administration, according to the given personality sketch.
