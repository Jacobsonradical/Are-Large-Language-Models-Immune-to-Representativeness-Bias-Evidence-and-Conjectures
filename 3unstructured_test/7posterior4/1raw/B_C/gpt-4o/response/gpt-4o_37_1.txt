To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field, and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule can be formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the precise numerical values of \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in each field.

**Qualitative Assessment:**

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H):** Adam's high intelligence and good ability to understand abstract concepts are indicative qualities for a student in computer science. His curiosity and puzzle-solving skills also align well with the field.
   - **P(H):** Computer science is a popular field among graduate students in the U.S.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H):** While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and empathy (useful in business administration), his qualities such as love for animals and nature curiosity might be less vital for this field. Business administration often involves skills in leadership, finance, and management.
   - **P(H):** Business administration is also a widely chosen field among graduate students in the U.S.

Given this qualitative assessment, we might hypothesize the likelihood of Adam being in computer science is higher than in business administration, based on his personality sketch.

A rough estimation for posterior probabilities, given the qualitative nature, might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

This assessment shows a higher likelihood for Adam to be in computer science compared to business administration based on his personality traits and the nature of the fields. Note that these probabilities are illustrative and based on typical tendencies that might not strictly conform to numerical computation.
