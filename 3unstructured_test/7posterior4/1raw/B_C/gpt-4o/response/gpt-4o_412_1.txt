To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for whether Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific quantitative data on prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field or the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch. 

Let's consider the sketch in detail to assess how well it aligns with each field:

### Personality Traits
- **Curiosity about nature and plants** - This trait is not particularly aligned with business administration but could be interesting in some branches of computer science, such as AI applications in biology.
- **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles** - This is more likely to be associated with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and analytical thinking.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals** - These traits don't strongly align with either field based on typical stereotypes but less relevant to business administration.
- **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts** - This is a strong fit for computer science, which involves abstract thinking and complex problem-solving.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication** - This is a general trait and could apply to both fields.

### Graduate Fields
- **Business Administration** - Typically involves leadership, management, finance, marketing, and interpersonal skills. Likelihood of strong empathy and warm heart, but less emphasis on abstract problem-solving.
- **Computer Science** - Typically involves programming, algorithms, computational theories, and solving complex puzzles. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles make this more likely.

Based on this qualitative assessment:

### Computed Probabilities
Let's theoretically assign values based on alignment.

- **For Business Administration (H1)**
  - \( P(E|H1) \) is low to moderate because the traits emphasize empathy and appreciation, but lack direct alignment with business skills.
- **For Computer Science (H2)**
  - \( P(E|H2) \) is moderate to high due to strong match with abstract problem-solving, intelligence, and enjoying puzzles.

Assigning values based on this qualitative alignment (arbitrary but reflective of qualitative fit):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These probabilities do not consider baseline enrollment probabilities in graduate fields (prior probabilities) which would refine these estimations further if available.
