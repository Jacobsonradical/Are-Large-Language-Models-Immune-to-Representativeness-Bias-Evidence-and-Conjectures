To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide specific numerical values for the probabilities, we would need detailed data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the proportion of students in each field), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each field), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing such a personality sketch). These data points are not provided in the question.

Given the descriptions and making some reasonable assumptions, we can conceptualize the relative likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively. Here is a qualitative assessment:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with common attributes found in computer science students. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science may be relatively high.
2. **Business Administration**: While empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial in business administration, the specific traits mentioned (love for animals, deep appreciation for nature, interest in abstract concepts) do not strongly align with typical attributes expected in business administration students. So, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration may be relatively lower.

Assuming we are giving relative likelihoods without precise statistical data, we might provide qualitative probabilities with the following values for illustration purposes:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Note that these values are illustrative and based on qualitative assessment rather than precise calculations.
