Bayes' Rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute accurate posterior probabilities for specific fields like business administration or computer science, we would need more context-specific information including prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). In practice, these values are often estimated based on relevant datasets, expert opinions, or domain-specific knowledge.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can qualitatively estimate how likely it is that he was enrolled in each field based on his traits and interests. Adam appears to have interests that align more with fields involving analytical thinking and a curiosity about natural phenomena.

### Considerations:
1. **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals with strong leadership aspirations, interest in corporate structures, and preference for strategic and managerial roles. Adamâ€™s traits such as a love for nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work could align to some extent, but his strong empathy and deep love for animals might make this less likely.
2. **Computer Science**: This field suits highly analytical individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence. Additionally, understanding abstract concepts is critical in computer science. Given Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence, this field seems like a plausible fit.

Given the qualitative nature of this information, we might reasonably assign the following probabilities:

\[ P(business\ administration | E) \]
\[ P(computer\ science | E) \]

Given the qualitative information, I will provide rough estimates, acknowledging we lack exact quantitative data:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

These estimates infer a greater likelihood that Adam's personal characteristics and interests align with computer science more than business administration, but they are not definitive probabilities and should be interpreted cautiously.
