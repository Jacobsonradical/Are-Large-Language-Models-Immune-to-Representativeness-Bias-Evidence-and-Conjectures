To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given fields, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numeric values for these probabilities, we have to make reasoned estimations. Let's consider the traits described in the personality sketch \( E \) and how they map to the fields of study. We'll then qualitatively assess the likelihoods and priors.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong matches.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is a relevant indicator.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is also relevant.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly related but not exclusive.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking are desirable but not specific.
   - Empathy and a warm heart can be relevant in aspects like leadership and ethics.
   - Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less directly related.

Based on this qualitative matching, we can infer the relative likelihoods:

\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) > P(E|\text{business administration}) \]

Given these directional assessments and typical proportions of students in these fields, we can make reasonable approximations for the priors, though specific numeric values for priors are usually institution-specific.

Providing plausible qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These probabilities reflect that, based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a higher likelihood of being enrolled in computer science compared to business administration. The probabilities do not sum to 1 because they do not cover all potential fields of study.
