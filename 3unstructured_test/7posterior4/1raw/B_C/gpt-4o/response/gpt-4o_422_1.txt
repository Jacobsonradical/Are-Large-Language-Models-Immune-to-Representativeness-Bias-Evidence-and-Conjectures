To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to understand Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and specific likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only make qualitative inferences based on the provided sketch of Adam’s personality and his specialization fields. Here’s a qualitative assessment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration may not heavily align with Adam's specified traits, such as a deep curiosity about nature, empathy, a love for animals, and abstract thinking associated with puzzles.
   - We might assign a low \( P(E|H) \) for this field based on personality traits.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science aligns more closely with attributes like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - The interest in puzzles and abstract thinking increase the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are not calculated precisely using Bayes' rule but are reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality sketch. For exact values, domain-specific data and prior distributions would be required.
