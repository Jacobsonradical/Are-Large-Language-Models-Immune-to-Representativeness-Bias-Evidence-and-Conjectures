To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. Unfortunately, we lack specific numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we can make qualitative assessments.

Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability. 

Given the information in the personality sketch E about Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is intelligent and understands abstract concepts well.
- He has an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's qualitatively assess the fit of this profile with the fields of computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This is a strong match, as computer science often involves problem-solving and logic.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: This aligns well with the requirements of computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals: These traits are less directly related to computer science but do not contradict it.

### Business Administration
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Vital for business administration.
- Empathy and a warm heart: Useful in roles involving management and human resources.
- Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts: These attributes are less typically associated with business administration but might be relevant in fields like sustainable business, agribusiness, or any role that involves data analysis and strategic thinking.

Based on these qualitative assessments, Adam's profile seems to align more naturally with computer science due to the specific mention of enjoying puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. 

We cannot compute exact probabilities without numerical data, but we can qualitatively suggest that Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in computer science is higher, compared to business administration.

Here's the answer in the required format:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative assessments and should be interpreted as such rather than precise probabilities.
