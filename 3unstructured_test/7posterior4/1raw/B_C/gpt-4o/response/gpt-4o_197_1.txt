To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, you need to consider the following: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the terms:
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having his personality traits, given that he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The normalizing constant ensuring that the sum of posterior probabilities equals 1 (can be omitted when comparing probabilities directly).

Given the personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about \( P(E|H) \) and use common sense for \( P(H) \). However, without actual data, we can only provide estimated heuristics:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): People in Business Administration may have diverse personality traits. While empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial, the consistent high intelligence and curiosity about abstract concepts might not be as highly aligned with typical Business Administration, but it's not impossible. Let's estimate this as 0.2.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Business Administration is a common graduate field. Let's assume a prior of approximately 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): His personality traits such as high intelligence, curiosity about nature, abstract thinking, and problem-solving align well with Computer Science. Estimated likelihood: 0.7.
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Computer Science is also a common field for graduates. Let's assume a similar prior of approximately 0.2.

Given these heuristics, we don't know \( P(E) \) explicitly, but since we are only comparing two fields, it can be ignored for comparative purposes:

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
\]

Since we are working without direct prior or likelihood values from data, these are rough estimates meant to approximate potential plausibility based on given traits. However, proper Bayesian inference would require actual dataset and prior probability distributions.

Thus, the conditional probabilities in simplified comparative format are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
