To apply Bayes' theorem in this context, we need to construct the following:

1. Prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in Business Administration (H_BA) and Computer Science (H_CS).
2. Likelihoods for the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in Business Administration (P(E|H_BA)) and Computer Science (P(E|H_CS)).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical data for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll use qualitative reasoning to approximate them.

### Prior Probabilities:

1. \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assume a moderate prior probability for business administration, reflecting common enrollment rates.
2. \( P(H_{CS}) \): Assume a moderate prior probability for computer science, reflecting common enrollment rates.
  
For simplicity, let's assume both are equally likely due to lack of specific information:

\[ P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

### Likelihoods:

1. \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Business administration students are typically interested in management, leadership, and economics rather than puzzles, abstract concepts, and nature. Thus, the likelihood seems lower.
  
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students often exhibit high intelligence, an interest in abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and possibly a quiet nature. Thus, the likelihood seems higher.

Let's assign approximate qualitative likelihoods:

1. \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \)

### Posterior Probabilities:

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Given that:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) \]

Let's compute it:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.5) + (0.7 \times 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.35 = 0.4 \]

Now, the posterior probabilities:

1. For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.05}{0.4} = 0.125 \]

2. For Computer Science:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.35}{0.4} = 0.875 \]

So, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.875
}
```
