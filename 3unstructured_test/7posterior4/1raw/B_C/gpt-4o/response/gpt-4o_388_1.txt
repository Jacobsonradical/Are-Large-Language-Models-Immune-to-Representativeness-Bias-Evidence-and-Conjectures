To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities P(H) for each field and the likelihoods P(E|H) of observing the personality traits given enrollment in each field. Since exact values for priors and likelihoods are not provided, I will make a reasoned estimate based on the information given.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit priors and likelihoods, we can only provide an informed estimate of the posterior probabilities. We'll assume the likelihoods based on the match between Adam's personality traits and the typical traits for students in these fields.

### Estimate:
- **Priors**: In the absence of specific information, we assume equal priors for simplicity, i.e., P(business administration) = P(computer science) = 0.5.
  
- **Likelihoods**:
  - **Business Administration**: Traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are less characteristic of business administration students. The likelihood P(E|Business Administration) is therefore relatively low.
  - **Computer Science**: Traits like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are commonly found in computer science students. The likelihood P(E|Computer Science) is thus relatively high.

### Reasoned Estimates:
- **P(E|Business Administration)**: 0.2 (low likelihood)
- **P(E|Computer Science)**: 0.8 (high likelihood)

Using these estimates, let's calculate the posterior probabilities. Because values for the priors and the overall probability of the evidence P(E) are not given, we'll factor them equally for simplicity, leading to the relationships among the two hypotheses.

Normalized, the posterior probability can be roughly:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ \approx 0.8 \]

Similarly:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.1}{0.5} \]
\[ \approx 0.2 \]

Based on these estimates, the posterior probabilities are:
