To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we have to consider Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have exact numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \), we can provide qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

We will make reasonable assumptions about how likely Adam's personality traits and interests align with each field.

**Business Administration:**
- Adam is warm-hearted with strong empathy, which can be important in leadership roles found in business.
- However, his deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles might not align as strongly with a typical business administration program if we contrast it with more fitting fields like biology or environmental sciences.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work can be found in business students, but the nature aspects and preference for abstract concepts may be less prevalent.

Thus, we might assume that \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is moderate.

**Computer Science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which is a strong fit for computer science.
- His appreciation for abstract concepts and nature-related curiosity could indicate interests in areas such as algorithms, bioinformatics, or environmental computing.
- Empathy and a love for animals may not be directly related but can influence his choice of projects or areas within computer science.

Thus, we might assume that \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is relatively high.

We normalize the probabilities based on qualitative fit rather than exact calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These qualitative estimates suggest that given Adam's personality, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
