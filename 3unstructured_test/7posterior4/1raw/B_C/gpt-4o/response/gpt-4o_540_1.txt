To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since exact prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, these values will be estimated based on common knowledge and assumptions about the fields and the personality sketch provided.

First, let's establish some assumed values:
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) and \( P(H_{ba}) \) are the prior probabilities that a graduate student is studying computer science or business administration. We will assume these both to be relatively common fields.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is the probability that someone in computer science has Adam's characteristics.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) is the probability that someone in business administration has Adam's characteristics.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing a personality sketch like Adam's generally across all fields.

Estimating likelihoods based on Adam's personality:
- Computer Science (CS): Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science.
- Business Administration (BA): While high intelligence and dedication are important, the traits like empathy and love for animals are less directly aligned with business administration.

We will assume a relatively higher likelihood for computer science and a lower one for business administration.

Estimated values:
- Prior probabilities (assumed to be equal for simplicity):
  \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.5 \)
  \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.5 \)

- Likelihoods based on personality sketch:
  \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7 \) (because of strong alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking)
  \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3 \) (less alignment with business-related skills)

- Evidence normalization term \( P(E) \):
Since it's common to both, let's assume \( P(E) = 1 \) for simplicity.

Combining these to find posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \times P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{1} = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \times P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{1} = 0.15 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:
```
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```
