To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), it is impossible to calculate the exact posterior probabilities. Instead, we can make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch.

Adam's qualities include:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these attributes, we can infer that certain fields might be more or less likely for Adam, giving us a subjective probability estimate.

### Subjective Probability Estimation:

**Computer Science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a strong understanding of abstract concepts, which are qualities that align well with computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals are not necessarily indicative of this field.
- Therefore, the probability might be moderate.

**Business Administration:**
- While business administration requires intelligence and dedication, there is no strong indication from Adam's personality sketch that he has a particular interest in this field. His empathy and warm heart may be useful but do not specifically point towards business administration.
- Therefore, the probability might be lower.

Given this qualitative assessment, here are the subjective estimates for P(H|E):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates are derived from an intuition-based assessment rather than a strict statistical calculation. The actual probabilities would depend on more detailed information and context about the base rates of students in these fields and more specific alignment of Adam's characteristics to these fields.
