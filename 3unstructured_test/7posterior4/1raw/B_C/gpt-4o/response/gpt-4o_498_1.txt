To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to provide accurate answers, we would need specific numerical values or strong assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). Without this data, I can offer a reasoned estimation based on qualitative analysis of the personality sketch of Adam and typical profiles associated with the fields.

Let's assume certain reasoned estimations to qualitatively rate the probabilities.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Business administration is a relatively common field.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical business administration traits (e.g., interest in nature, puzzles, empathy, love for animals).
   
   Reasoned guess: Low probability.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits (curiosity, puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align well with common characteristics of successful computer science students.
   
   Reasoned guess: Moderate to high probability.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are indicative and based on a reasoned qualitative assessment rather than exact numerical calculations.
