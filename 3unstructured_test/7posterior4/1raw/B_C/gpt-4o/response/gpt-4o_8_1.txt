To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality traits \( E \) given he is in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality traits \( E \) across all fields.

In the absence of specific numeric values, we can still reason qualitatively and estimate the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Business administration students might have curiosity and intelligence, but the traits described (appreciation for nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are less typical. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) could be relatively low.
   - \( P(H) \): The base rate of students in business administration could be moderate.
   - Overall: Combining these, 

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Computer Science students often have high intelligence, are good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoy problem-solving (puzzles). Thus, \( P(E|H) \) would be relatively high here.
   - \( P(H) \): The base rate of students in computer science could be high, particularly in graduate studies.
   - Overall: Combining these,

Based on these qualitative considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are hypothetical estimates derived from a qualitative understanding given the description of Adamâ€™s personality traits and their commonality with the fields of study. For precise probabilistic values, specific statistics and data would be required.
