To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities and likelihoods. Here’s the framework of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Without explicit numerical values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll make educated guesses based on the personality sketch.

### Assumptions

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**: This depends on general enrollment statistics for these fields in 2021, which we assume to be relatively equal for simplicity.
2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: This depends on how well Adam's characteristics fit typical students in these fields.

**For Computer Science (CS):**
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: High, because CS students often need high intelligence, puzzle-solving abilities, and an understanding of abstract concepts. Less aligned with business administration traits.
  
**For Business Administration (BA):**
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Moderate to low, because while intelligence and appreciation for hard work align, the traits such as strong empathy and deep love for animals are less indicative of a typical BA student.

Now, let’s provide hypothetical values based on our assumptions:
- Prior probabilities \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assume both are roughly equal, let's say 0.5 for simplicity.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Let's assume 0.7 (high fit).
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Let's assume 0.3 (moderate to low fit).

Finally, we can approximate the posterior probabilities:

\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
\]

Here, \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, and thus it normalizes the probabilities across all hypotheses.

Computations:
1. \( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.35/P(E) \)
2. \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.15/P(E) \)

Since the exact value of \( P(E) \) is unknown but it acts as a normalization constant, we can report the ratios:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```
