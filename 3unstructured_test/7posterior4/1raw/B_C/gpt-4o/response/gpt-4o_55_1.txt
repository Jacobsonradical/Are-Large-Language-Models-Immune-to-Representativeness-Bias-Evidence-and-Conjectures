To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), the prior \(P(H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only give qualitative estimates.

Given the personality sketch, we will qualitatively evaluate how likely it is for Adam to be enrolled in business administration or computer science.

### Business Administration
Consider the likelihood of each characteristic:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants - This is typically less associated with business administration.
2. Warm heart, strong empathy - These traits can be relevant to business roles that involve leadership or human resources.
3. Solving puzzles and high intelligence, abstract concepts - These traits can be useful in strategic aspects of business.
4. Deep love for animals and appreciation for hard work - Less directly relevant to business administration.

The overall likelihood is somewhat lower.

### Computer Science
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants - Less directly relevant, though the analytical mindset is useful.
2. Warm heart, strong empathy - These traits are less stereotypical but increasingly valued in team-based projects.
3. Solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts - These traits are highly relevant to computer science.
4. Deep love for animals and appreciation for hard work - Not directly relevant but indicative of a conscientious and dedicated nature.

The overall likelihood is higher for computer science based on the abstract thinking and problem-solving component.

Thus, based on qualitative analysis, here is the estimated probability using appropriate but unspecified priors and likelihoods:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these values are estimated based on qualitative reasoning and should ideally be backed by actual data for precision.
