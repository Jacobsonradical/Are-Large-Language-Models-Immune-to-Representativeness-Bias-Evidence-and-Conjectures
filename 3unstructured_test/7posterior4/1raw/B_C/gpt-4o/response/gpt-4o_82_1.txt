Given the details provided in Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses \( H \) being computer science and business administration.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific empirical data (prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or evidence probabilities \( P(E) \)). Therefore, we'll need to make informed assumptions based on Adam's characteristics and relevance to each field.

### Assumptions:

#### Computer Science:
1. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
2. Solving puzzles suggests logical and computational thinking skills.
3. Quiet and enjoys solitary, thoughtful work—matches the common stereotype of a computer scientist.

#### Business Administration:
1. Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could be aligned with understanding and managing people.
2. However, less explicit alignment with interests in nature, solving puzzles, and deep love for animals.

### Informal Estimation of Likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): High, since many characteristics (problem-solving, intelligence, appreciation for hard work, etc.) match.
    - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Assumed moderate as a common field.
    - Hence, \( P(H_{CS}|E) \): Relatively high.

2. **Business Administration:**
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Lower because the specific interests and personality traits (nature, puzzles, animals) don’t strongly align.
    - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assumed moderate as another common field.
    - Hence, \( P(H_{BA}|E) \): Lower.

### Estimations:
These are rough estimates based on the alignment of characteristics.
