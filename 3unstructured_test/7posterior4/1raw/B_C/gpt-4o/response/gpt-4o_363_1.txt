To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis given the evidence.
3. The overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' Rule is stated as: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only attempt to qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities based on our understanding of the field requirements and Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics, he seems more inclined towards fields that require a high degree of curiosity, empathy, intelligence, and abstract thinking. Now let's qualitatively estimate the likelihood of Adam being in each field:

- **Business Administration (MBA)**:
  - Empathy and understanding people are beneficial in business.
  - Abstract thinking and intelligence are useful for strategic planning.
  - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are not directly relevant.
  - Good understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication align well with business.

  Overall, there is some relevance, but elements like curiosity about nature and love for animals don't strongly align with typical MBA characteristics.

- **Computer Science**:
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are critical in computer science.
  - Solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving in programming.
  - Curiosity about nature can be aligned with scientific curiosity in computing.
  - Strong empathy is less directly relevant, but can benefit in collaborative projects and ethical considerations.

  Overall, significant aspects of Adam's personality fit well with computer science, especially his problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.

Given these qualitative analyses, we can propose:

\[ P(E| \text{computer science}) > P(E| \text{business administration}) \]

While exact numerical probabilities are challenging to specify, we can estimate relatively.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values suggest a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science than in business administration, based on his personality sketch.
