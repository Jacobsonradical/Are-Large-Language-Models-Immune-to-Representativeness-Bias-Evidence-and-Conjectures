To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{cs}) \): Prior probability that a student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{ba}) \): Prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that the student is in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

To proceed, we need to evaluate these probabilities. Since exact values are not provided, we can make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam. Let's make some educated guesses:

1. **Probability of the personality traits given the field ( \( P(E|H) \))**:
   - For computer science:
     - Computer science students may be curious about abstract concepts and enjoy solving puzzles.
     - However, specific interest in nature and plants might be less common.
   - For business administration:
     - Business administration students may value empathy and appreciate hard work.
     - Deep interest in nature and animals might be less directly relevant.

Thus, \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) may be slightly higher than \( P(E|H_{ba}) \), given that solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are more aligned with computer science.

2. **Prior probabilities ( \( P(H_{cs}) \) and \( P(H_{ba}) \))**:
   - Let's assume a roughly equal distribution of students in the U.S. among various fields of study. However, computer science might have a more people due to the tech industry demand.
   - For the sake of simplicity, let's assume \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \) and \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.1 \). These are just illustrative assumptions and can vary.

Let's qualitatively estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) = 0.08, higher affinity due to abstract concepts and puzzles.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) = 0.04, lower affinity due to less relevance to business traits.

Finally, we need \( P(E) \). Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + \text{probabilities for other fields} \), and given the sum would average out due to many fields, let's assume \( P(E) \) as a constant normalizing factor.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.04 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

However, we're interested in relative values. Normalize using these as weights (not absolute posteriors).

{
  "computer science": 0.08 * 0.2 = 0.016,
  "business administration": 0.04 * 0.1 = 0.004
}

To convenience in showing full perspective:

{
  "computer science": ~0.8,
  "business administration": ~0.2
}
