To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidenceâ€™s overall probability.

Without specific values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods (i.e., \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \)), we can't compute the exact probabilities. However, we can reason qualitatively about how likely Adam might be in each field based on his personality sketch.

Based on the given personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Interest in solving puzzles aligns with the problem-solving skills required in computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also crucial for success in this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work can align with leadership and management skills.
   - However, there is no direct mention of interest in business practices, economics, or management strategies.

Given these considerations, we qualitatively estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood that Adam's traits align more closely with computer science than with business administration based on the provided personality sketch. Note that these values are qualitative estimates rather than computed exact probabilities.
