To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's fields of study, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \), which normalizes the probabilities. Even though this is required for exact values, we can focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for the purposes of this question.

Let's outline plausible assumptions for \( P(E|H) \) (how well Adam's personality matches a student in these fields) and \( P(H) \) (based on typical enrollment rates):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Given Adam's traits (high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles), there's a strong fit for computer science.
   - Therefore, we could assign \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) a high value.
   - Assuming moderate enrollment rates, let's set \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) to a middling value.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in Business Administration, but it is less closely related to some of his other traits (like problem-solving and love for animals).
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) would be lower than for Computer Science.
   - Assuming enrollment rates are similar in both fields, let's also set \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) to a middling value.

Given these assessments, let's assign values to the conditional probabilities. Although we won't have exact numbers for normalization, we can focus on the relative likelihoods:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8, \quad P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5, \quad P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \]

Without normalizing, the relative probabilities \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \) are proportional to:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.4 = 0.32 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.20 \]

Normalizing over these fields is not done since it's stated that total does not need to add up to 1. The exact posterior values are difficult to determine without \( P(E) \), but the ratios can be informative.

Thus, based on the rough proportional values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.32,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

This suggests Adam is relatively more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science than in Business Administration given his personality sketch.
