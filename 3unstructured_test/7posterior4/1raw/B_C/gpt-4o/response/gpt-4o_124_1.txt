To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to rely on both the prior probabilities of being enrolled in each field (based on general statistics or assumptions about graduate enrollments) and the likelihood of observing the given personality traits (E) in someone enrolled in these fields. 

However, exact numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided here, so I'll present how such values might be conceptualized qualitatively.

Assuming:
- P(computer science) and P(business administration) denote the prior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in these fields.
- P(E|computer science) and P(E|business administration) denote the likelihoods of observing Adam's personality traits given enrollment in these respective fields.

Given that we don't have actual numbers, we'll use educated guesses based on Adam's personality traits and typical profiles for these fields.

1. Adam's interest in nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals suggests less alignment with typical profiles for business administration.
2. Adam's intelligence, capability with abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills might align well with a computer science profile, although his specific interests in nature and animals don't directly indicate such a field.

Here is the subjective assessment:

- "computer science": Adam's traits in puzzle-solving and abstract concepts suggest some alignment, though not perfect.
- "business administration": Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical profiles in business administration.

Given these qualitative insights:

P(computer science) and P(business administration) might be set based on general field population assumptions (e.g., more students in business than in computer science).

P(E|computer science) > P(E|business administration)

For simplicity:
Assume P(computer science) = 0.3 
Assume P(business administration) = 0.4

Then use the above qualitative likelihood assessments to adjust these priors slightly:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",  // suggesting an increased likelihood based on Adam's traits
  "business administration": "0.2"  // suggesting a decreased likelihood based on Adam's traits
}
