To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \), we can only make an educated qualitative assessment based on the information from the personality sketch, E.

Let's intuitively evaluate how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field and use this qualitative information to provide a rough estimate of the posterior probabilities.

For Business Administration:
1. Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is relevant to business.
2. However, his interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles may not strongly align with the typical focus areas of business administration.

For Computer Science:
1. Adam is noted to have high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which is a strong fit for computer science.
2. His quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align well with the typical work in computer science, which often involves problem-solving and dealing with abstract models.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can reason that Adam's interests and skills are more aligned with computer science than with business administration.

Thus, we can provide rough qualitative estimates as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These values are reflective of a greater likelihood that Adam's personality and interests align with computer science compared to business administration, but they are not exact probabilities and are meant for illustrative purposes. The remaining probability would be distributed among other possible graduate fields of specialization that might also fit Adam's profile.
