To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem, which is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, such as business administration or computer science.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Without specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we will make subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H) \): Generally, business administration is a common graduate field of study, but might not perfectly align with Adamâ€™s characteristics.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): Business administration might not typically attract students who have a strong curiosity about nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts, suggesting a lower likelihood given the sketch.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H) \): Computer science is also a common field, especially given the increasing demand for tech skills.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, abstract concepts, and his quiet nature, computer science appears to be a more likely field for him.

Given these estimations:
- We might consider that \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) > \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).
- For \( P(H) \), both fields could be assumed to have roughly similar general popularity.

Let's denote subjective values for illustrative purposes:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (assuming equal popularity)

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + \text{others} \]

Given \( \text{others} \) field probabilities normalize the factors, we will ignore them for simplicity here.

\[ P(E) = (0.2)(0.3) + (0.7)(0.3) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.21 = 0.27 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{(0.2)(0.3)}{0.27} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{(0.7)(0.3)}{0.27} \approx 0.778 \]

Thus, the estimated posteriors are:
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.78
}

This illustrates a higher posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the evidence from his personality sketch.
