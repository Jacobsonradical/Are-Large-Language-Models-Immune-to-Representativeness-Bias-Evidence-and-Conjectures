To apply Bayes' Rule for computing the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use the information given in the personality sketch E and our knowledge about the likelihood of those characteristics occurring in students of the two respective fields.

Bayes’ Rule can be formulated as follows:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of drawing the personality sketch given a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch.

Since we are comparing between business administration and computer science, we assume identical priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity, as specific data isn't given to adjust them meaningfully. Thus, what primarily matters here is \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality traits given those fields.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Characteristics like a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication could align well with business.
   - However, traits like a deep love for nature and animals, strong empathy, and quiet personality less typically characterize business students.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with CS.
   - A quiet personality and interest in puzzles also align well with the typical profile of students.
   - Love for nature and animals might not directly relate but doesn't contradict it either.

Plausible likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) for each:

- **Business Administration** might have those traits, but they are less compelling.
- **Computer Science** has a stronger alignment with Adam’s sketch.

Given these qualitative evaluations, let’s estimate \( P(E|H) \) in a rough, heuristic manner:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.7
\]

Assuming equal priors for simplicity:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5
\]

\( P(E) \) essentially cancels out here since it's a common denominator.

Thus, the estimate for posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]

Normalizing to compare:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.2}{0.9} \approx 0.22 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.7}{0.9} \approx 0.78 \)
}

So, in formatted output:

{
  "business administration": "0.22",
  "computer science": "0.78"
}
