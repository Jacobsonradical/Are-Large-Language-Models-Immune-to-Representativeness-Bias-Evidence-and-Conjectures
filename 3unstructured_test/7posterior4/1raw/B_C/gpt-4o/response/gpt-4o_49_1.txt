To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and business administration, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, in this scenario, we are not given explicit values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \). Instead, we will make reasoned estimates based on the information provided.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Evidence**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are characteristics beneficial in computer science.
   - **Hypothesis**: Enrolled in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Evidence**: Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These attributes are not directly related to business administration but could contribute to a people-oriented leadership style.
   - **Hypothesis**: Enrolled in business administration.

Given the abstract nature of the problem and without specific priors, we make educated guesses. Let's take reasonable educated guesses for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- **Computer Science**: 
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively higher because the traits such as high intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and abstract thinking align well with computer science.

- **Business Administration**: 
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be lower, as the traits of empathy and care for animals do not directly align with the typical skills emphasized in business administration programs.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.30
}
```

These values indicate that it is more probable for Adam to have been enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch provided. Note that the values do not sum to 1, reflecting the possibility of other fields in which Adam might have been enrolled.
