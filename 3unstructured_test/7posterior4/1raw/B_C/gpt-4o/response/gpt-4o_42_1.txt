To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we would use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to find, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \), and \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

In the absence of specific numerical values, we can instead provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and our understanding of the fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H) \): The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are less directly aligned with business administration, which generally emphasizes skills like leadership, economics, and management.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, but given Adam's specific interests, it seems less probable that he would choose this field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H) \): The traits described (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are more closely aligned with computer science. The field often requires a strong aptitude for logical thinking and problem-solving.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a relatively common field for graduate students, particularly those interested in abstract thinking and problem-solving.

Given this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimates based on the given information and are intended to reflect the likelihood of Adam's personality aligning with these fields. In a real-world scenario, numerical data and additional context would be required for precise calculations.
