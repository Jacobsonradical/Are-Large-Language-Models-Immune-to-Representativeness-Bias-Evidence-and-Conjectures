To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and how well the personality sketch \( E \) fits each field. Here's the structure of Bayes' rule as it pertains to this situation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior probabilities (which represent our initial beliefs before seeing Adam's personality sketch), I'll make a reasonable assumption:

1. **Business Administration**: Often attracts individuals with strong leadership skills, interpersonal skills, an interest in organizational functions, and possibly an affinity for empirical data and economics. 

2. **Computer Science**: Often attracts individuals with a strong analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, curiosity about technology, and an interest in abstract thinking and puzzles.

Given Adam’s characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- A quiet demeanor 
- Warm heart and empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem more aligned with the profile of a computer science-oriented student, given his interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.

Let's denote our assumed priors and likelihoods:

- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \)

These are arbitrary priors based on the broader context, assuming computer science might have a higher enrollment rate among students with Adam’s traits.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \)

Again, these likelihoods indicate how well Adam's traits fit each field.

Normalizing constant \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.3 = 0.36 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.36} = \frac{0.06}{0.36} = 0.167 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.36} = \frac{0.3}{0.36} = 0.833 \]

Final probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.833
}
```
