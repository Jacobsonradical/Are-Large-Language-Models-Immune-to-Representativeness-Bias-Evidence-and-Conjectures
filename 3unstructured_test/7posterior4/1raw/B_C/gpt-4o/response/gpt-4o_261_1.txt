To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence, which is a normalizing constant.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and common characteristics in each field.

### Qualitative Analysis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. However, curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less commonly associated with computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): There are a significant number of graduate students in computer science.
   - Overall, the probability \( P(H|E) \) will be moderated by these factors; given the evidence, it’s plausible but not the most likely.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Business administration typically requires strong people skills, strategic thinking, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, it’s less associated with high intelligence related to abstract concepts, curiosity about nature, and empathy for animals.
   - \( P(H) \): Graduate students are also commonly found in business administration programs.
   - Overall, the probability \( P(H|E) \) might be lower because the personality sketch aligns less with typical business administration traits.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Given these analyses, let's assign reasonable values between 0 and 1 for \( P(H|E) \) without exact numerical calculations, reflecting the qualitative judgment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are based on the notion that Adam's personality sketch aligns somewhat more with the typical traits of a computer science student than a business administration student, but recognizes that Adam's interests in nature and animals are not highly indicative of either field.
