To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

To make an estimation, we'd usually require specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Since we don't have precise data, we'll qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): The evidence suggests someone who is curious about nature, empathetic, and loves solving puzzles. These traits do not strongly align with a typical business administration background, which often values leadership, charisma, and decision-making over curiosity about nature and empathy. Let's assume a moderate to low likelihood, say 0.2.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Business administration is a common field among graduate students. We'll assume a moderate prior probability, say 0.3.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): The evidence strongly aligns with traits such as high intelligence, quiet nature, love for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts. These are common traits for a computer science student. Let's assume a high likelihood, say 0.7.
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Computer science is also a prevalent field among graduate students. We'll assume a moderate to high prior probability, say 0.3.

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both scenarios, it can be normalized later so we'll just focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Let's plug in these assumed values:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

To make the \( P(E) \) consistent across the comparisons, we normalize the values:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.06 \text{ (unnormalized)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx 0.21 \text{ (unnormalized)} \]

Summing them up to normalize:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.06 + 0.21 = 0.27 \]

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.22 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.27} \approx 0.78 \]

Hence, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.78
}
