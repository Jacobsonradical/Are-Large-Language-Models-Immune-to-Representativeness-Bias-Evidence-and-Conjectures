To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields given Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field (H) given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, irrespective of his field. 

Because we're focusing on the relative probabilities, we can work with the unnormalized posteriors and then rank them.

Making assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns well with computer science.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is important in computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - A strong appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well with business administration.
   - However, the personality traits such as a love for animals and nature, and empathy are not as directly related to the core of business administration compared to computer science.

Given these observations, letâ€™s qualitatively assign probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \), the likelihood of observing the sketch if Adam is in computer science, is relatively high.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \), the likelihood of the sketch if Adam is in business administration, is lower compared to computer science.

We don't have exact prior probabilities \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \), so we assume them to be equal for simplicity, and focus on the likelihoods.

Therefore, if we denote the conditional probabilities qualitatively based on these assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam fitting the profile of a computer science student compared to a business administration student given his described personality.
