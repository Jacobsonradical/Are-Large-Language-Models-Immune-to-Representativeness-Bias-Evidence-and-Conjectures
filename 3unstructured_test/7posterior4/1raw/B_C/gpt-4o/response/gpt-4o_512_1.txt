To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant (the total probability of the evidence).

Since we donâ€™t have explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we need to reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics and skills required in each field. 

### Estimation of Likelihoods and Priors

**Computer Science:**
- Evidence \( E \) indicates high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and empathy. These traits align well with a computer science student, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are crucial skills.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) would be relatively high.

**Business Administration:**
- Evidence \( E \) indicates empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication, which are relevant for business administration. However, the deep love for nature, puzzles, and animals might not closely align with the typical traits of business administration students.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be lower than that for computer science, but still significant.

### Estimation of Priors

**Prior Probability:**
- Without specific data, we assume that all fields have a uniform prior probability, i.e., they are equally likely before considering the evidence.

### Normalizing Constant:

**\( P(E) \):**
- This is a common factor across all fields and ensures that the probabilities sum to 1, but since we do not need the total to add up to 1, this can be treated as a normalizing factor within each individual calculation.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign rough estimates to the posterior probabilities. Note that these numbers are heuristic and illustrative rather than exact.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.7):** High alignment with abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and intelligence as reflected in the personality sketch.
- **Business Administration (0.3):** Some alignment with empathy and appreciation for hard work, but less so with abstract concepts and puzzles. 

We emphasize that without numerical priors and likelihoods, these values are simplified qualitative estimates.
