To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we first need to understand Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's total probability, which is often a normalizing constant.

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only provide qualitative estimates based on the description of Adam and the typical profiles of students in these fields.

### Analysis:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration students typically have an interest in organizational leadership, economics, finance, and management. While these students can have a variety of interests, the traits described in E (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence, love for animals) might not align directly with common traits associated with business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is likely low.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) depends on the general popularity of business administration among students.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer science students often have strengths in problem-solving, logical reasoning, and abstract thinking, which align closely with Adam's traits such as solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is likely high as the skills and interests described are common among computer science students.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) also depends on the general popularity of computer science among students.

Given these qualitative estimates:

### Conditional Probability Estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** The provided traits do not strongly match the typical profile of a business administration student. Thus, the posterior probability is relatively low.
- **Computer Science (0.7):** The traits described in Adam's profile—math skills, problem-solving, abstract thinking—align well with characteristics commonly found in computer science students, making this probability relatively high.

These values are qualitative estimates meant to reflect the alignment between the personality traits described and the typical skills and interests of students in these fields. In a more rigorous analysis, actual data on the distribution of these traits among students in these fields would be required.
