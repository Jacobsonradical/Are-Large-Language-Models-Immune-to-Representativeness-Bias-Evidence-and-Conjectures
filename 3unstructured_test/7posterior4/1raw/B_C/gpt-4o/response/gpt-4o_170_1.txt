To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of his personality sketch given each field (\( P(E|H) \)), and then normalize these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which normalizes the posterior distribution and can be expressed as: \( P(E) = \sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \) over all possible hypotheses \( H_i \).

For simplicity, assuming that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are equal for all graduate fields, we can ignore the normalization factor in the absence of specific data about graduate field distributions. 

Let's estimate the likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam has high intelligence, a genuine curiosity for nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts. These traits are generally favorable for computer science students.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{cs}) \)): High

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit well in business administration, especially in fields related to sustainability, non-profits, or human resources.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{ba}) \)): Moderate

Given hypothetical prior probabilities of \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.5 \), and our qualitative assessment of likelihoods, we can compute rough estimates of the posterior probabilities. 

Assuming:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.6 \)

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \approx 0.8 \) (ignoring normalization for illustrative purposes),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.6 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \approx 0.6 \) (ignoring normalization for illustrative purposes)
}

Normalization would adjust these values to ensure they sum up appropriately over all potential graduate fields. However, since we are looking for a qualitative comparison here and ignoring normalization, these rough estimates suggest Adam is more likely to be in computer science given his personality sketch.

So, the answer in the requested format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.6
}
