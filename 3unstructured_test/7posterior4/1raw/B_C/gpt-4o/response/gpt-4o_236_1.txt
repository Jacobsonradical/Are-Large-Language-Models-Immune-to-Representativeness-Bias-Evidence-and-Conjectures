To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we rely on the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for each of these probabilities, we have to proceed with qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \) and the fields in question.

1. **Computer Science:**

Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with what is typically required in the field of computer science. Someone with genuine curiosity and high cognitive abilities is well-suited for complex problem-solving and abstract thinking needed in this field.

2. **Business Administration:**

Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills, leadership, and a strategic mindset. Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, which are useful in any field but do not directly indicate a preference or compatibility with business administration over other fields.

With these considerations in mind, we would assign higher posterior probability to Adam being in computer science than business administration, but it is not an absolute conclusion due to the lack of precise numerical probabilities.

Using a qualitative assignment within the range (0, 1):

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Note: These values are hypothetical and based on qualitative assessment. Precision would require more specific data on the likelihoods and priors.
