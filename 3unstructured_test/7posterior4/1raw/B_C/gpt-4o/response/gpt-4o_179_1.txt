To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to formulate the problem correctly based on the given personality sketch of Adam (E) and the plausible hypotheses (H). Bayes' rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) directly given in the prompt. Instead, we'll make informed estimations based on the provided details:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability that the description of Adam's personality E matches someone in the specific graduate field H.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is the base rate probability of Adam being in each respective field without considering the personality description.
3. **Marginal \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall likelihood of the personality sketch E, considering all possible fields.

Given that Adam's personality sketch suggests a preference for natural curiosity, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work, we can qualitatively assess the fit to each field:

### Business Administration:
- **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: This field doesn't strongly align with Adam's noted empathy, love for animals, or natural curiosity. Some aspects like intelligence and appreciation for hard work could align. Thus, we might estimate this as lower.
- **P(H) for Business Administration**: Many students pursue this field, suggesting a non-negligible prior.

### Computer Science:
- **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: This field might align more closely with puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and the appreciation of solving abstract problems. The curiosity about nature can align with the emerging fields like bioinformatics.
- **P(H) for Computer Science**: Given its popularity, this field likely has a significant prior probability.

We'll qualitatively assess these probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

This output suggests a higher posterior conditional probability for Adam being enrolled in Computer Science over Business Administration, aligned with his described preferences and skills. 

Keep in mind that these probabilities are approximations based on qualitative reasoning. A more precise answer would require actual data regarding enrollment rates and personality fit measures for these fields.
