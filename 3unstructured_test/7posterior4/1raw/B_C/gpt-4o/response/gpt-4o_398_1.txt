To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Given this, we will make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch to derive qualitative estimates for the probabilities. 

We can outline our considerations as follows:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Adamâ€™s high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles correlate strongly with the skills typically required in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - While Adam has a strong work ethic and empathy, which are important in business administration, his strong affinity for nature, animals, and puzzles does not align as strongly with typical interests in business administration.

Let's assume reasonable values based on these considerations:

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
    - For simplicity, let's assume graduate students are uniformly distributed across different fields, so priors are approximately equal.

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)**:
    - The likelihood that a student with Adam's personality profile is in computer science is reasonably high because of his skills in abstract thinking and enjoyment of puzzles.
    - The likelihood that a student with Adam's personality profile is in business administration is reasonably lower because his profile does not strongly match typical interests and skills required in that field.

### Estimates:
Given these qualitative evaluations, our probabilities could be roughly:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

***Note***: These values are estimates based on reasonable assumptions and not derived from specific prior data. For accurate calculations, actual data on student distribution and likelihoods would be necessary.
