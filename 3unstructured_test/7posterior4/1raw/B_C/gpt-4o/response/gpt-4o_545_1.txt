Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to rely on the provided personality sketch (E) and use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in a specific field before considering the personality sketch) or \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the given personality sketch given enrollment in a specific field), we cannot calculate exact numerical values. Instead, we will use qualitative reasoning based on the supplied information to provide approximate estimates.

Considering Adam's personality sketch and its alignment with typical characteristics of students in various fields:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - **Relevant Traits**: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - **Less Relevant Traits**: Strong empathy, deep love for animals (though not irrelevant, they are less emphasized in this field).
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Relevant Traits**: High intelligence, strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **Less Relevant Traits**: Genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals (these traits are less emphasized in this field).

Given this qualitative assessment, we can approximate the probabilities, acknowledging that this is not a precise calculation but an educated guess based on the alignment of personality traits with typical traits of students in these fields.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

The reasoning is that computer science aligns more closely with Adam's strong affinity for solving puzzles and abstract thinking, while business administration places slightly less emphasis on those traits but still values intelligence and dedication. These estimates reflect the likelihood of these fields based on the given personality sketch, within a simplified qualitative framework.
