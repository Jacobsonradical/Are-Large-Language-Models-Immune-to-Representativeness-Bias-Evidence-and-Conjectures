To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis (enrollment in computer science and business administration), as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) â€” the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \). Since we don't have those exact figures, we will make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics that align with each field. 

Given that Adam has a penchant for curiosity, puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, these traits generally align more with fields like Computer Science. Whereas fields like Business Administration might require different traits, such as a focus on leadership, strategy, and interpersonal communication skills, which are not mentioned in Adam's personality sketch.

Let's make the following rough estimates:

1. \( P(H|E) \):
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's characteristics, let's estimate a high likelihood that he fits the profile for a computer science student. Say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).
   - Business Administration: The personality traits provided don't strongly align with a typical business administration student profile. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \).

2. \( P(H) \) (prior probability):
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science might be \( 0.2 \) (20%).
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration might also be \( 0.2 \) (20%).

3. \( P(E) \) (normalizing constant):
   - This is more complex and would involve summing up all possible \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for every possible field of study. But for the sake of simplicity and since we are only given two fields to consider, we can approximate that \( P(E) \) is sufficient to normalize our final results.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

So, for Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

And for Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

To normalize, they should sum up with others to 1 overall in a complete model, but given just these two fields:

For Computer Science:
\( P(\text{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \)

For Business Administration:
\( P(\text{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \)

So, the approximate posterior probabilities (before normalizing) are as follows:

{
  "computer science": "0.14",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}

This shows a higher probability that Adam might be enrolled in Computer Science based on the provided personality sketch. Note that in a more detailed analysis, the probabilities would be normalized considering all possible fields.
