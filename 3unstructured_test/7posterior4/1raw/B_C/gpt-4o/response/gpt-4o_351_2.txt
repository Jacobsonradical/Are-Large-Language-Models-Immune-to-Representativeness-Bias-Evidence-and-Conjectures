To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we would need various pieces of information:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration (BA) or computer science (CS).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each respective field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which normalizes the results but isn't strictly necessary as we are calculating relative probabilities.

Without concrete data, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge of typical scenarios. 

### Assumptions:

- **Priors**: Let's assume equal priors for simplicity:
  - \( P(\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \) = \( P(\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.5

- **Likelihoods**: 
  - Given Adam's strong attributes like genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy, and talent for understanding abstract concepts, he is less likely to be in a business administration field and more likely to be in a field like computer science, which often requires understanding abstract concepts and solving problems.

So, let's assume:
  - \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{BA}}) \): lower, say 0.2
  - \( P(E|\text{H}_{\text{CS}}) \): higher, say 0.7

### Applying Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For business administration (\( H_{\text{BA}} \)):
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For computer science (\( H_{\text{CS}} \)):
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only looking for relative probabilities:
\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{BA}}|E)} = \frac{\frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}}{\frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}} = \frac{0.35}{0.1} = 3.5 \]

### Normalizing:

We know \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) + P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) will not sum to 1, so instead, we represent them in relative terms:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.1} = 0.777 \]
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.35 + 0.1} = 0.223 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.223,
  "computer science": 0.777
}
```

So, based on the given personality sketch and assumptions, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
