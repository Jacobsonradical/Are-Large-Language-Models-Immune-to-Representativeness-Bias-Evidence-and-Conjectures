To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not only the likelihood P(E|H) but also the prior probabilities P(H) of Adam being enrolled in each field. However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities or the exact likelihood values from data, this will be a qualitative reasoning rather than a precise numerical calculation. 

Given Adam's personality traits, we can make educated guesses about the fields that might suit his interests:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits well with a field that requires logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. He also understands and appreciates the hard work and dedication, which are essential in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**: This field generally requires strong skills in leadership, management, and communication. While Adam has empathy and a warm heart, which could be valuable, his personality sketch does not strongly indicate a predisposition towards business activities such as analyzing markets, managing people, or strategic planning.

By qualitatively evaluating P(E|H) based on the given personality sketch (E), we can make an educated guess about the relative posterior probabilities.

Hereâ€™s the Bayesian estimation based on the qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

This suggests that, given Adam's personality traits and interests, the field of computer science is more likely, but there's still a reasonable chance he could be in business administration. The actual numerical values might vary with more precise data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
