To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each given field using Bayes' rule, we will need the following information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in that specific field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are missing specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can use logical approximations based on typical characteristics of individuals in each field.

For business administration:
- \( P(E|H) \) might be lower because business administration students are generally seen as more focused on practical applications, management, and strategic thinking rather than having strong empathy for animals and a love for nature and puzzles.
- \( P(H) \) might be relatively common due to the popularity of business administration among graduate students.

For computer science:
- \( P(E|H) \) might be higher as computer science students often exhibit strong problem-solving skills and high intelligence with an appreciation for abstract concepts, aligning with Adam's personality sketch.
- \( P(H) \) is also relatively common.

Given our qualitative analysis, we can infer the following approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These are rough approximations based on the typical alignment of Adam's described traits with the stereotypical characteristics of students in those fields. For precise probabilities, one would need detailed statistical data on the distribution of such traits among graduate students in those fields.
