To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field and how well his personality sketch \( E \) fits with each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) (which acts as a normalizing constant).

Since we don't have explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally involves leadership, management skills, interest in business, and may not directly align as well with a strong curiosity about nature, empathy, or deep love for animals.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) might be moderate for a general graduate student but low for someone with Adam's profile.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is likely low to medium.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Often involves problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and may align well with high intelligence and curiosity about various complex systems.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) might be moderate for a general graduate student.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is likely higher, given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Based on these assumptions, we can assign subjective probabilities for illustrative purposes:

### Calculations:

- For **Business Administration**:
  - Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.2 (prior probability)
  - \( P(E|H) \) = 0.1 (likelihood that someone with Adam's profile would be in this field)
  - \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and acts as a normalizing factor.
  
  Using Bayes' rule:
  
  \[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
  Ignore \( P(E) \) for now, as we're comparing relative probabilities.

- For **Computer Science**:
  - Let's assume \( P(H) \) = 0.3 (prior probability)
  - \( P(E|H) \) = 0.4 (likelihood that someone with Adam's profile would be in this field)
  - \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and acts as a normalizing factor.
  
  Using Bayes' rule:
  
  \[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Computed Probabilities (Relative):

Normalize these values relatively:

1. Business Administration:
   \[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. Computer Science:
   \[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

The relative probabilities suggest computer science is a more likely field for Adam based on his personality sketch.

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These values are illustrative and subject to change based on more precise prior and likelihood estimates.
