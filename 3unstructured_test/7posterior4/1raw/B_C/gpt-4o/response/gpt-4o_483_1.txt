To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either business administration or computer science based on his personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since we do not have specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we'll need to make reasoned assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - The personality sketch indicates a love for nature, animals, solving puzzles, empathy, and intelligence. These traits seem less directly related to business administration.
   - It is less typical for a business administration student to have a strong focus on nature and animals.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - The traits of enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align more closely with the typical personality of a computer science student.
   - Empathy and love for nature and animals are not commonly highlighted traits for computer science but do not strictly oppose it.

Based on these qualitative evaluations, we can make the following inferences:

- \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is likely lower because the personality sketch is less typical for business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{comp\_sci}) \) is likely higher because the personality traits partially align with computer science students.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{comp\_sci}) = 0.4 \]

Without specific information on \( P(H) \), let's assume a neutral prior probability distribution for simplicity:
\[ P(H_{business}) \approx P(H_{comp\_sci}) \approx 0.5 \]

Now, we compute the relative posterior probabilities.

\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{comp\_sci}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{comp\_sci}) \cdot P(H_{comp\_sci})}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have a value for \( P(E) \), we are only interested in the relative probabilities. Thus:
\[
P(H_{business}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05
\]
\[
P(H_{comp\_sci}|E) \propto P(E|H_{comp\_sci}) \cdot P(H_{comp\_sci}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.2
\]

Normalizing these relative values, we get:
\[
P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.2} = \frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2
\]
\[
P(H_{comp\_sci}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.05 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{0.25} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, our qualitative Bayesian inference yields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
