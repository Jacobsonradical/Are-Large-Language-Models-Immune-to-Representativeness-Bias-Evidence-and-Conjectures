Bayes' rule allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. Mathematically, Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for business administration and computer science respectively, we need to make some reasonable assumptions regarding the prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Nature and Plants**: This suggests possible interest in fields such as biology, environmental science, or botany.
2. **Solving Puzzles**: This could be relevant for fields like mathematics, computer science, or engineering.
3. **Empathy and Love for Animals**: Could suggest fields like veterinary science, psychology, or any helping profession.
4. **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts**: Relevant for computer science, mathematics, physics, and other analytic fields.
5. **Appreciation for Hard Work and Dedication**: This attribute is quite general and could apply to any field.

Given these attributes, let's estimate the likelihoods for business administration and computer science.

### Business Administration

- Nature and plants: Likelihood is low.
- Solving puzzles: Not particularly characteristic.
- Empathy and love for animals: Not especially relevant.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts: Some relevance through analytics and strategy.
- Appreciation for hard work: Relevant but general.

### Computer Science

- Nature and plants: Neutral or low relevance.
- Solving puzzles: Very relevant.
- Empathy and love for animals: Low relevance, but not contradicting.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts: Very relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work: Relevant but general.

Given these considerations, let's assign some rough likelihoods and priors:

- Prior probability prior likelihood \( P(H) \):
  - Business Administration: 0.20 (general but not overly relevant based on personality traits)
  - Computer Science: 0.30 (higher likelihood given puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills)

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - Business Administration: 0.1 (traits align weakly)
  - Computer Science: 0.4 (traits align strongly)

The overall marginal probability \( P(E) \) can be ignored for relative comparison if we are comparing only between these fields. So, the comparison relies primarily on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Calculation:

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.20 = 0.02
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.30 = 0.12
\]

Here is the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

These numerical results provide a sense of relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch. For more accurate results, additional data on the distribution of personalities in these fields would be required.
