To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of evidence \(E\).

We lack specific numerical values for the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), the priors \(P(H)\), and the marginal \(P(E)\) explicitly. However, we can make educated guesses based on the description of Adam's personality and interests. 

Without precise data, I will qualitatively estimate these values:

1. **Computer science** might fit well given Adam's high intelligence, his propensity for understanding abstract concepts, and his enjoyment of solving puzzles. These traits are often seen in computer science students. 

2. **Business administration** is less likely because while it can involve a high level of intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, the description doesnâ€™t highlight a particular interest in business-oriented subjects but rather focuses on nature, animals, and problem-solving.

Here is an estimated assessment:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
\]
