To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate several components: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Since we don't have detailed information about the priors or likelihoods, I will estimate the probabilities based on the given personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality traits given that Adam is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits across all fields.

Given Adam's personality traits, we can infer the following likely fits for the fields of computer science and business administration:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, and has high intelligence.
   - Understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciates hard work and dedication.
   - Strong empathy might also be a contributing factor, but the traits seem less aligned compared to computer science.

Therefore, we assign higher \( P(E|H) \) values where the traits align well and estimate the prior \( P(H) \) based on typical personality fits for the fields. Without exact data, we'll make some educated guesses:

### Estimates:
- Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.3 (assumption: reasonable fit)
- Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.2 (assumption: less fit)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.6 (good fit)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) = 0.3 (less aligned)
- Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) = Weighted average of all possible fields, assume 0.25 for simplicity in this simplified scenario.

Now, let's calculate:

### Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.25} = \frac{0.18}{0.25} = 0.72 \]

### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.25} = \frac{0.06}{0.25} = 0.24 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.72,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```

These values are educated estimates based on the provided personality traits and reasonable assumptions about the fit for each field.
