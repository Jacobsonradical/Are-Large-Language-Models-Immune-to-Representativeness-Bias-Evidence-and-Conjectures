To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more detailed information about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field. However, given the personality sketch provided for Adam, we can make some reasonable qualitative assessments.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior and likelihood values, we can only provide rough estimates based on qualitative reasoning. 

1. **Business Administration**

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

It seems less likely, though not impossible, that Adam would choose a field like Business Administration, which typically attracts individuals with strong interests in leadership, management, and business operations rather than nature, puzzles, and animals.

2. **Computer Science**

Adam's traits also suggest:
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles (which is often a significant part of computer science)
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (critical in fields like algorithms, artificial intelligence, and theoretical computer science)

These characteristics align more closely with what one might expect from a student in computer science.

Considering these points, our rough estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are speculative and would vary significantly with real, empirical priors and likelihoods. They are based on the subjective assessment of Adam's alignment with the typical student profiles in these fields.
