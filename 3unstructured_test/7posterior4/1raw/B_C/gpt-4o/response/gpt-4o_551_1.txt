To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and business administration given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Given Adam's high intelligence, appreciation for abstract concepts, and love for puzzles, it's plausible that he might be involved in a field like computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals might not align perfectly with the typical perception of a computer science graduate student.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Although Adam's understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are important traits in business administration, his deep love for nature, animals, and quiet personality might make business administration less likely.
   - Business administration is often associated with leadership, communication, and extroversion, which are not strongly indicated in Adam's personality sketch.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here are the reasonable estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the provided personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam is enrolled in a computer science program rather than a business administration program, but neither field perfectly aligns with his profile.
