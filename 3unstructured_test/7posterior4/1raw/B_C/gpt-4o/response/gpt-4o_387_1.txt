To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and considering the hypotheses:
1. \( H_1 \) = Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( H_2 \) = Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We'll need to qualitatively assess the likelihoods \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \), the prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

For simplicity, let's assume equal prior probabilities for both fields, \( P(H_1) = P(H_2) = 0.5 \).

### Assessment of Likelihoods

- **Business Administration (H1):**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: less relevant.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: low relevance.
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: somewhat relevant due to human-centered skills.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: somewhat relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant in a general sense but not specific to business.
  
  Based on these characteristics, we might give \( P(E|H1) \) a lower value.

- **Computer Science (H2):**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: low relevance.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: highly relevant.
  - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: lower relevance, but not excluded.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: highly relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant and applicable.

  Thus, \( P(E|H2) \) gets a higher value.

### Qualitative Likelihoods:
Based on the personality traits, a rough qualitative estimate might be:
- \( P(E|H1) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H2) = 0.7 \)

### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule for both fields:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} \]

### Denominator (Normalization constant):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.35 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.45 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.222 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.45} \approx 0.778 \]

### Final Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.222,
  "computer science": 0.778
}
```

These values are based on subjective assessments of the likelihoods based on the given personality traits. In a real-world scenario, additional contextual or statistical information might adjust these probabilities.
