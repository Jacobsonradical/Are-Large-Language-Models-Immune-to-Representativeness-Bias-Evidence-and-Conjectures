To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need certain pieces of information, including the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihoods of observing the personality characteristics given each field (\( P(E|H) \)). Without concrete data on these probabilities, we must make reasoned estimates.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor that is constant across both hypotheses (fields of study) for a given personality sketch, we can focus on the numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuinely curious about nature and plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted and empathetic.
- Strong love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let’s make reasoned qualitative estimates:

1. **Business Administration**: This field may attract individuals with analytical skills and an understanding of hard work and dedication, but it may not strongly correlate with characteristics like curiosity about nature or a love for animals.

2. **Computer Science**: This field is more likely to attract individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and understand abstract concepts. 

Given these considerations, we hypothesize higher likelihood for computer science than business administration.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(H = \text{business administration}) \) = 0.25 (a reasonable prior probability)
- \( P(H = \text{computer science}) \) = 0.25 (a reasonable prior probability)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) (since the personality traits align less with typical business administration interests)
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \) (since the personality traits align well with typical computer science interests)

We use these to find unnormalized posterior probabilities:
- \( P(H = \text{business administration} | E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \)
- \( P(H = \text{computer science} | E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.1 \)

Normalizing these values across our assumed fields (not exhaustively since no need to equal 1):
- Adjust values, ensuring our qualitative understanding is respected, without perfectly normalizing. 

# Final Estimates:
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}

These values offer qualitative assessment aligned to traits and domain knowledge. Quantitative precision needs real prior and likelihood data.
