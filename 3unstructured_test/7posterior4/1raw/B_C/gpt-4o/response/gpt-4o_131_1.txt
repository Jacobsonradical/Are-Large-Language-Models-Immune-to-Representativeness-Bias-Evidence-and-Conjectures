To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to make educated assumptions about \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).

### Assumptions and Reasonings:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam is noted for high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which align well with skills required in computer science. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \).
   - \( P(H) \): Graduate students in computer science are fairly common. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25 \) (25%).
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Key traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work could help in business administration, though specific interests like nature and abstract thought are less directly aligned. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(H) \): Graduate students in business administration are also common. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \) (30%).

### Calculating \( P(E) \):
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we don't need its exact value to compare \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) and \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \).

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

For comparative purposes, we'll simplify:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.175 / P(E)
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.09 / P(E)
\]

Comparing the relative probabilities:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.09} \approx 0.66
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.175 + 0.09} \approx 0.34
\]
