To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the actual prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in a particular field) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of exhibiting the personality sketch given a particular field), we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Let's break down the characteristics provided to assess the likelihood for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Neutral/not specifically indicative.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Positive indicator for computer science, as it involves problem-solving.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Neutral/not typically correlated with the field.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Strong positive indicator for computer science.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Positive indicator.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: Neutral/not specifically indicative.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Somewhat relevant, especially if problem-solving relates to business challenges.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: Positive indicator as it relates to interpersonal skills and corporate social responsibility.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Positive indicator.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Strong positive indicator.

Given the qualitative analysis of the personality sketch, we can posit that both computer science and business administration have some relevant traits. However, problem-solving and abstract thinking are more critical to computer science and business administration also matches well due to the emphasis on empathy and hard work in leadership and management.

Thus, if we were to assign approximate weights based on the qualitative assessment, they might look something like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are not calculated through precise statistical methods but are suggested based on the given characteristics and their relevance to the respective fields.
