To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know certain values, including the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field of study. Without specific numerical data, we will have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
- While specific prior probabilities aren't provided, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of graduate students in computer science and business administration might be significant but not uniformly distributed.
- For simplicity, assume:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25
  \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
- The likelihood is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in a particular field. Considering Adam's attributes:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Puzzle-solving ability, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are strongly aligned with what is required in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for animals might not be a common trait for computer science students but doesn't necessarily exclude it.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy, understanding hard work, and dedication might fit well with business administration.
   - However, the deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might be less relevant.

Given these qualitative assessments:
- For **Computer Science**: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) might be relatively high, say 0.7.
- For **Business Administration**: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) might be lower, say 0.3.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can be omitted for relative comparison.

### Calculation:
- Computer Science:
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175
  \]

- Business Administration:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075
  \]

We now normalize these to provide relative probabilities:

- Sum of both proportions: \( 0.175 + 0.075 = 0.25 \)

### Normalized probabilities (for relative comparison):
\[ 
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.25} = 0.7
\]
\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
