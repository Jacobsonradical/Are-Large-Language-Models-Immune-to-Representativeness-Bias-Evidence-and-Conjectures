To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don’t have concrete data or specific priors, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the given information. We can rank the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) fits the common traits of students in each field.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align with computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles fits computer science well.
   - Inferred \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication can fit business administration.
   - Strong empathy and interaction with people could be seen in business fields.
   - Inferred \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is moderate to low as not all traits align perfectly.

Without specific numerical priors, we are somewhat limited. Still, based on our assumptions:

### Estimating Likelihoods:
- We assume \( P(E) \) is constant across both fields for simplicity.
- Assume \( P(H) \) (prior) is equal for both fields if we don't have specific data suggesting otherwise.

### Calculation:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{\text{High}}{\text{Constant}} \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{\text{Moderate to Low}}{\text{Constant}} \)

Given the alignment, let’s suppose the qualitative assessments result in:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.6 \) (reasonable high fit)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate fit)

### Final Posterior Probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This suggests Adam is more likely to be a graduate student in computer science compared to business administration, given his personality traits.
