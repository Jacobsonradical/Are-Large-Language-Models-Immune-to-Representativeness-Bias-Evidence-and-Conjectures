To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can make educated assumptions about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in different fields based on his characteristics. We don't have exact prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), but we can make qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities.

**Computer Science**:
- Given the information that Adam is of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a love for nature (although not directly related, potential application in areas like environmental data analysis), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science could be relatively high.

**Business Administration**:
- Given the information, there's less direct alignment with Adamâ€™s strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication which might be more generalized and not strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration would be lower compared to computer science.

We will assume some relative prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the personality characteristics provided.

So, based on the qualitative assessments, let's provide estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the characteristics typically associated with students in the specified fields. Adjustments could be made if more detailed statistical data were available.
