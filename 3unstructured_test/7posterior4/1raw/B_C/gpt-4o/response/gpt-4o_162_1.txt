To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in that field, regardless of any personality sketch.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality traits \( E \), given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field \( H \).
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which can be expressed as \( P(E) = \sum_{H} P(E|H)P(H) \).

Given we do not have specific prior probabilities, we will make assumptions for simplicity. We'll assume reasonable estimates for \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch \( E \) aligns with each field of study.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities

Let's assume for simplicity:
- \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H = \text{business administration}) = 0.15 \)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)

Given the personality sketch, the subject has traits like curiosity about nature, love for solving puzzles, empathy, and a deep appreciation for hard work.

#### Computer Science

- High intelligence and abstract thinking are strongly aligned with computer science.
- Solving puzzles is also very much related to computer science.
- Empathy, while beneficial in any field, is less directly related to the core domain knowledge but can be useful in areas like user experience or human-computer interaction.

We'll assign a high probability but not perfect for \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \):

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

#### Business Administration

- Empathy and a warm heart are very relevant for business, particularly in management, HR, and customer relations.
- Abstract thinking and high intelligence are useful but may be used differently than in computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals doesn't directly align but can manifest in certain niches like environmental business or sustainable development.

We'll assign a moderate probability for \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \):

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration})P(\text{business administration}) + \ldots \)

### Estimating \( P(E) \)

Let's sum over the two fields:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration})P(\text{business administration})
\]

\[
P(E) \approx (0.6 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.15)
\]

\[
P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.165
\]

### Final Posterior Probabilities

#### Computer Science

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{0.165} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.165} \approx 0.727
\]

#### Business Administration

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration})P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.165} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.165} \approx 0.273
\]

The resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
```
