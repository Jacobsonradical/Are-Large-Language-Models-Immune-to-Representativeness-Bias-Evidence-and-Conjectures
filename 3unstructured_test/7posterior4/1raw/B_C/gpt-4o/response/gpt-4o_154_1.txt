To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam's potential enrollment fields, we need to take into account both the personality sketch \( E \) and prior probabilities associated with each field. However, because specific prior probabilities are not provided, I will base my estimations on the logical fit between Adam's personality sketch and characteristics typically favorable for success in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the qualitative nature of the available information, I will estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with traits typically associated with success in each field, and \( P(H) \) will be informed by general knowledge about the popularity and accessibility of these fields. I will assume \( P(E) \) is the same for each hypothesis and thus it can be ignored as a normalizing constant when comparing probabilities.

I'll now make educated assumptions regarding \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

### Computer Science
- Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant.
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work may align with collaborative and long-term project aspects in computer science.

### Business Administration
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are relevant.
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work align with leadership and team management skills important in business.

However, the alignment seems slightly stronger for Computer Science due to specific mentions of puzzle-solving and abstract understanding.

Letâ€™s denote \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \) based on the alignment of his traits, and assume prior probabilities \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \) simply as rough estimates for common fields of graduate studies.

Using these assumptions, we qualitatively estimate:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Normalize relative strengths (just between these two) gives us:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.12} \approx 0.6 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.12}{0.18 + 0.12} \approx 0.4 \)
}

Thus, the qualitative probabilities are approximations and do not account for the fact that the totals should sum to less than 1 due to other fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
