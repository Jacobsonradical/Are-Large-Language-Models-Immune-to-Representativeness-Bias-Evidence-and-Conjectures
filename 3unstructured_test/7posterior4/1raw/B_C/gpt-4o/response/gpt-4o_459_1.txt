Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we must make reasoned estimates based on the descriptions provided.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, intelligence, problem-solving skills, and aptitude for abstract thinking align relatively well with characteristics often found in computer science students, although his strong empathy and love for animals might be less directly related.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam's warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could be advantageous in business administration, the sketches lack references to elements commonly tied to business studies, such as leadership aspirations, an interest in economics, or organizational dynamics.

With these considerations, we can infer the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively. Letâ€™s assign somewhat higher posterior probability to computer science because of the alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking.

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are qualitative estimates based on the given information and are subject to more accurate revision with specific numerical data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
