To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) which is the probability of the evidence given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- The evidence \( P(E) \) which is the total probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Estimating prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for different graduate fields can be challenging without specific data, but let's assume some reasonable approximations based on the popularity of these fields:

- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Next, we'll estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- For computer science:
  - Curiosity about nature and abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
  - High intelligence and problem-solving skills are also a good fit.
  - Empathy and love for animals are neutral (neither strongly for nor against).
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)

- For business administration:
  - Curiosity about nature and animals is less relevant.
  - Empathy and warmth may fit well in business roles focused on people management.
  - Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are definitely valuable.
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)

Total evidence \( P(E) \) can be tricky without knowing the likelihoods for all possible fields. For simplicity, let's assume the total evidence is normalized such that the likelihoods we've computed dominate the other unspecified fields.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

- For computer science:
  \[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.06} = \frac{0.21}{0.27} \approx 0.78 \]

- For business administration:
  \[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.21 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.27} \approx 0.22 \]

So the posterior probabilities using the rule are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.22
}
```
