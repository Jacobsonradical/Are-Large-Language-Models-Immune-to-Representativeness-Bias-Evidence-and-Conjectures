To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each of these fields and how well the characteristics in the personality sketch \( E \) fit each field. For simplicity, let’s assume that:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \) for computer science and business administration, respectively, are equally likely among many possible fields; hence, \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \). (Note: These priors are illustrative; actual priors would depend on various factors such as general popularity of the fields among graduate students.)

2. We analytically estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) based on the fit between Adam’s personality sketch and the characteristics typical of students in these fields.

Given Adam's traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: More likely aligned with fields like biology or environmental science, but could fit computer science (e.g., bioinformatics) less so for business administration.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts: Strongly indicative of computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Can lean towards biology or environmental sciences; slightly less relevant but not exclusive to computer science or business administration.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: Universally applicable but traditionally emphasized in business administration.

To operationalize this, let's assign subjective likelihood values:

\( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \) — Adam's traits significantly align with characteristics valued in computer science.
\( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) — Some traits are relevant, but others less so for business administration.

Bayes' rule calculation:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same denominator for both probabilities, we can simply compare the numerators for a relative measure.

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

Relative probabilities (normalized):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.02} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.06 + 0.02} = 0.25 \]

Thus, given Adam's personality traits, here's a simplified posterior conditional probability calculation based on the assumed priors and likelihoods:

{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
