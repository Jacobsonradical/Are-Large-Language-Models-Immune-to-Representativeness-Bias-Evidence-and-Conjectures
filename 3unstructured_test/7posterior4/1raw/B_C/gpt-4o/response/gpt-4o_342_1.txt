To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we must consider the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the elements involved:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam showing the personality traits described if enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of Adam showing these personality traits, regardless of the field of enrollment.

For simplicity, because we do not have actual statistics, we'll make educated guesses based on the general characteristics associated with graduate students in each field.

**Hypotheses:**

- \( H_{CS} \) = Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \) = Adam was enrolled in business administration.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** 
   Given the vast number of fields, the prior distribution could be challenging to estimate accurately. We assume an equal prior probability for simplicity:
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{N} \]

   Assuming \( N \) is the total number of possible graduate fields, but we don't need to know \( N \) as it will cancel out when comparing the fields.

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** 
   Based on Adam's personality traits:
   - **Computer Science (CS):** Generally, CS students are characterized by high intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, interest in nature and plants is less common in this field.
     \[ P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \]
   
   - **Business Administration (BA):** Business students might have empathy and appreciation for hard work, but their interest in nature and abstract thinking might be less pronounced.
     \[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Marginal Likelihood (\( P(E) \)):** 
   This is the same for both fields and thus can be disregarded for comparative purposes.

Using these assumptions, applying Bayes' Rule for each field:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{N} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{N} \]

Normalizing these to make them conditional probabilities (not exceeding 1 and comparing proportionally):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.2} = \frac{0.4}{0.6} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.2}{0.4 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{0.6} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33 \]

Thus, the rough posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}

These values indicate that based on the provided traits, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
