To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, let's assume a uniform prior distribution \( P(H) \), which means that without any specific evidence favoring one field over the other, Adam had an equal chance of being in any field. This means \( P(H) \) is equal for business administration and computer science.

Since we do not have a detailed breakdown of the probabilities, we can make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and the typical traits and interests of students in these fields.

For evidence \( E \), let's evaluate the fit for each field based on Adam's traits:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not strongly aligned with business administration.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Could be relevant for business problem-solving, but not a primary trait.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Can be relevant but not a primary trait in business administration.
   - High intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant for strategic thinking but more so in fields like computer science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Universal trait, not specific to business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Not directly relevant but curiosity itself is a good trait for research and development.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly aligned with computer science, which often involves problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Not specific to the field but can reflect well on teamwork and collaboration.
   - High intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts: Highly relevant to computer science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Highly relevant for any rigorous academic field, including computer science.

Given this qualitative assessment, we intuitively infer:
- \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \): Low to moderate probability.
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \): Higher probability as multiple traits align well with the typical profile.

Without exact numerical values, we can estimate:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = 0.8 \]

So the answer would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```
