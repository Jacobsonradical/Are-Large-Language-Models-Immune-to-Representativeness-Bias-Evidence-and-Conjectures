To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, the overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics across all fields.

Without specific numeric data for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, I'll make informed estimates and discuss the reasoning. Note that these values are hypothetical and based on general observations about graduate fields and Adam's personality traits.

### Reasoning:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Relevant Traits**: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - **Estimate**:
     - \( P(E|H) \): Quite high, as many computer science students display these traits.
     - \( P(H) \): The prior might be moderate to high, as computer science is a common graduate field.
     - \( P(E) \): Broad enough to encapsulate multiple fields but relatively rare traits compared to some other fields.

   Given these considerations, I'd estimate:

   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.6 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Relevant Traits**: Appreciation for hard work and dedication, possibly high intelligence, but fewer direct links to other traits like solving puzzles or empathy towards nature/animals.
   - **Estimate**:
     - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to low, as business administration students might not often demonstrate Adam's specific combination of traits.
     - \( P(H) \): The prior might be moderate, as business administration is a prevalent field.
     - \( P(E) \): Again, relatively rare traits across all fields.

   Given these considerations, I'd estimate:

   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \]

Thus, the resulting estimates would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are hypothetical and should be taken as rough estimates based on common characteristics associated with each field and Adam's described traits. Actual probabilities would require empirical data.
