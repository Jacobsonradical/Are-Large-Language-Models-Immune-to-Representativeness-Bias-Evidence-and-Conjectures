To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information to define both the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis. Since specific values for these probabilities are not provided, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and the given information in Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Prior probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - These are the general probabilities that a randomly chosen graduate student is enrolled in computer science or business administration. Exact values can vary, but let's assume:
     - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.30 \) (30%)
     - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.20 \) (20%)

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - These are the probabilities that a person with Adam's observed characteristics would be found in each field.

Assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:
   - For **computer science**:
     - Adam's high intelligence, curious nature about abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well.
     - Many computer science students have strong problem-solving skills and enjoy abstract thinking.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.50 \).

   - For **business administration**:
     - Adam's empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial in business administration, especially in roles focusing on corporate social responsibility or leadership.
     - However, these traits are not as strongly aligned with the specific technical and analytical focus often emphasized in business administration programs.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and we don't need the exact value to compare the two probabilities, we can use the numerator for comparison:

- For **computer science**:
  \[ P(\text{computer science}|\text{E}) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.50 \times 0.30 = 0.15 \]

- For **business administration**:
  \[ P(\text{business administration}|\text{E}) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.20 \times 0.20 = 0.04 \]

Next, we normalize these values to find the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.15}{0.19} \approx 0.789 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.19} \approx 0.211 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.789,
  "business administration": 0.211
}
