To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence E given that H is true.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence E, which can be computed as the sum of the likelihoods times the priors for all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule in the context of this problem can be written as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact numerical values for the priors (\(P(H)\)) and the likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)), we have to make educated guesses based on the sketch provided. 

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:
- \(P(H_{cs})\) and \(P(H_{ba})\) represent the prior probabilities for Adam enrolling in computer science and business administration, respectively.
- \(P(E|H_{cs})\) and \(P(E|H_{ba})\) represent the likelihoods of Adam's personality sketch given these fields.

### Assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:
- **Computer Science**:
  - Curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, strong appreciation for hard work (High match with computer science characteristics).
  - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Relatively high because logical thinking, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work are important traits in this field.

- **Business Administration**:
  - Strong empathy, warm heart, understanding and appreciation for hard work (Potentially beneficial but lower match compared to the abstract and logical traits).
  - \(P(E|H_{ba})\): Lower likelihood because traits such as puzzle-solving and interest in abstract concepts are less directly tied to what is traditionally expected in business administration.

Given these qualitative insights, we can make relative assumptions about the probabilities. Let's assume:

- \(P(H_{cs}) = 0.3\) (30% chance that a random graduate student is enrolled in CS)
- \(P(H_{ba}) = 0.2\) (20% chance that a random graduate student is enrolled in Business Admin)
- \(P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.7\) (High likelihood of personality traits matching CS)
- \(P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.3\) (Lower likelihood of personality traits matching BA)
- \(P(E)\): Normalizing constant which ensures probabilities sum up to 1, considered over all hypotheses.

### Computation:
Let's compute:

1. **For Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

2. **For Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + \text{other fields} \]
Given that there are other fields and for simplicity, we will consider the proportions that explain portions described:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.3) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) + \text{other components} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.21 + 0.06 + \text{other components} \]

It's approximative, but to simplify:
Assume \(P(E)\) as a normalizing constant which will not affect our specific ratios greatly.

Now we can finalize the relative posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.21}{0.21 + 0.06 + \text{other components}} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.21 + 0.06 + \text{other components}} \]

Since exact calculations can't be finalized without a full list of fields, we'll give ratios:
Assuming "other components" not overly skewing it.

### Result:
- Computer Science is roughly more likely than Business Admin, calculated approximate higher:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

Hence providing the values:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
