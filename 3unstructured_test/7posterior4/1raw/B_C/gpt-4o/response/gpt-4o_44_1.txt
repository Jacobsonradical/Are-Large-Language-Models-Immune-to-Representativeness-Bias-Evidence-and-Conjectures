To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that field. However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these, we will make educated guesses based on the description provided.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given:
- Hypotheses \( H \) are the specific fields of study: computer science and business administration.
- Evidence \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.

### Reasoning of Probabilities:
1. **Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skills required for computer science. His interest in puzzles and curiosity about nature (which includes computational biology, AI, etc.) can also make this field relevant. So, we can assume a moderately high likelihood here.
   - **Business Administration**: While empathy and appreciation for hard work may align with some aspects of business administration (like HR or leadership), his strong inclination towards nature and animals is less directly related. Thus, the likelihood might be lower.

2. **Priors, \( P(H) \):**
   - We should assume equal priors for simplicity due to lack of specific data, such as \( P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E) \):**
   - This is a normalizing factor across all hypotheses and doesn't need to be explicitly calculated for this qualitative comparison.

### Qualitative Calculation:
Assigning qualitative probabilities based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

Here, we have:
- \( P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.3 \)

Note: These are subjective estimates based on the provided information and assumptions. Exact calculations would require more precise numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
