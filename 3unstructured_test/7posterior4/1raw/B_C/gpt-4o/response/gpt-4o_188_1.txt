To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), i.e., the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given \( H \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), let's assume that these fields have equal prior probabilities. This assumption is only for illustrative purposes and may not reflect actual enrollment statistics. 

If we assume equal prior probabilities, the analysis hinges largely on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Given the details in the personality sketch of Adam (E),
- His genuine curiosity about nature and plants,
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles,
- Warm heart and empathy,
- Deep love for animals,
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts,

We need to assess how well these traits correspond to each field.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoy solving puzzles: High relevance.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts: High relevance.
- Curiosity: Medium relevance (depending on the area; AI, bioinformatics might be highly relevant).

**Business Administration:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance.
- Empathy: Medium relevance (useful in management, HR).
- Understanding abstract concepts: Medium relevance.
- Dedication: Medium relevance.

Given that Computer Science seems to align more closely with Adam's skills and interests, we assign a higher likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science than for Business Administration. 

Assuming prior probabilities are equal, Bayes' rule simplifies to comparing relative likelihoods.

**Likelihood Assignment (assumed for illustration)**
- \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) = 0.75 \) (75%)
- \( P(E|H_{business\_administration}) = 0.25 \) (25%)

Given these likelihoods:
\[
P(H_{computer\_science}|E) \propto P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \cdot P(H_{computer\_science})
\]
\[
P(H_{business\_administration}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business\_administration}) \cdot P(H_{business\_administration})
\]

As prior probabilities are equal:
\[
P(H_{computer\_science}|E) = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H_{business\_administration}|E) = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

This is a simplified calculation and assumes equal priors. For a more accurate computation, we'd need actual enrollment data (priors) and more detailed likelihood assessments.
