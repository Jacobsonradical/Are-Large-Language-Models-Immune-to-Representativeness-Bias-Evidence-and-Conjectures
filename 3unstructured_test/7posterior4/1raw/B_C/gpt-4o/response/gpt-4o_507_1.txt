To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we employ Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities for each field. Since we are not given specific priors, we'll assign equal priors initially:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{N} \]

where \( N \) is the total number of possible fields.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration

We don't have the exact likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \), but we can make reasonable guesses based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts
   - Enjoys solving puzzles

These characteristics align well with traits commonly associated with computer science students. Therefore, we can estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) to be relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Warm heart, strong empathy
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits also align somewhat with attributes useful in business administration, but they are less directly related than those for computer science. Therefore, we can estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) to be lower than \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \).

To summarize, given the information, letâ€™s make heuristic assignments:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \]

We assume equal priors:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{N} \]

Given \( N \approx 10 \) plausible fields for a graduate study, we get:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]

Finally, we normalize these probabilities, but since we are not asked to ensure they sum to 1, our primary interest is in their relative magnitudes:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Here is the final output with these proportions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
