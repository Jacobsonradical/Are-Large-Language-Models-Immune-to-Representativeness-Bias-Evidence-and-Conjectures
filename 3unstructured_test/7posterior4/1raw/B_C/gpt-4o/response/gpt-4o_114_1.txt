Sure, I can help guide you through the process of calculating posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule. However, please note that to accurately compute \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need prior probabilities and likelihoods that are not provided in the sketch. We'll have to make some reasonable assumptions to proceed.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume that the prior probabilities for being enrolled in each field are equal, as we don't have any specific information suggesting otherwise.
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   We need to assess how likely Adam's personality sketch is given that he is enrolled in each field.

From the sketch:
- "High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts" would fit well with both computer science and business administration.
- "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals" fits better with fields that align more closely with nature and social sciences, but we can also stretch some of these qualities to fit other fields less directly.

Let's assign some reasonable likelihoods:
- \( P(E | \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E | \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   \( P(E) \) can be computed, but it is not necessary for comparing hypotheses because it remains constant for all fields we consider.

Using Bayes' rule, we get:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

We could normalize these probabilities to ensure they sum to 1 within the comparison context.

\[ P(E) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.2}{0.25} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the approximations are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This result suggests Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, given the provided personality sketch.
