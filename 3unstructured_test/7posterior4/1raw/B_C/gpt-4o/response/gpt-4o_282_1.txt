To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and how likely his personality traits are given each hypothesis. Since we don't have specific numerical priors or likelihoods, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, we can qualitatively assess the fit for the fields of business administration and computer science.

First, let's state Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

Now, let's make some qualitative assessments and assumptions:

**Business Administration:**
- Prior Probability \(P(H)\): Graduate programs in business administration are popular fields, but they may not align perfectly with Adam's described personality traits.
- Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy may have a lower likelihood in business administration.

**Computer Science:**
- Prior Probability \(P(H)\): Computer science is another popular field, and high intelligence and solving puzzles are strong indicators.
- Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Traits such as understanding abstract concepts and enjoying solving puzzles have a higher likelihood here.

Let's assign some qualitative probabilities and use these in our calculations. Note that these are just illustrative:

- \(P(H_{\text{business}})\) = 0.2 (somewhat less likely based on traits)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{business}})\) = 0.1 
- \(P(H_{\text{cs}})\) = 0.4 (more likely based on traits)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{cs}})\) = 0.5 

We assume \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} \\
                         &= \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \\
                         &= \frac{0.02}{P(E)}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \\
                   &= \frac{0.5 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \\
                   &= \frac{0.20}{P(E)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both, we're comparing relative values:

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = 0.02
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = 0.20
\]

Now, let's express the results:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.20
}

Remember, these values are illustrative and based on qualitative assessments and assumptions. In practice, actual probability values would require more specific data.
