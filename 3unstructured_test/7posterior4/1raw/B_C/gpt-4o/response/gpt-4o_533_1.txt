Bayes' rule can be used to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), which is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \). Bayes' rule is described by the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Weâ€™ll need to make several assumptions for the components of Bayes' rule, such as \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(H) \), the prior probability of the hypothesis, and \( P(E) \), the probability of the evidence across all hypotheses. Because we do not have exact numbers, I will make some logical assumptions about \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \), and focus primarily on the relative magnitudes.

1. **business administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that a graduate student in business administration fits Adam's personality sketch is relatively low. Business programs often lean towards social skills, management, finance, and less towards nature and animal empathy.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability of a student enrolling in business administration is moderate as it's a common field of study.

2. **computer science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood that a graduate student in computer science fits Adam's personality sketch is higher. Interests in solving puzzles and high intelligence suit a computer science background.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of a student enrolling in computer science is high due to the field's popularity.

Considering these factors, we can assign rough estimates to these probabilities.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is a common normalization factor and will be proportional.

Using Bayes' rule qualitatively:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

Thus,

\[
\text{Posterior Probabilities:}

  "business administration": 0.02,

Keep in mind these values are qualitative estimations and actual probabilities would depend on the precise statistical data available for the respective fields and the likelihoods of the personality traits described.
