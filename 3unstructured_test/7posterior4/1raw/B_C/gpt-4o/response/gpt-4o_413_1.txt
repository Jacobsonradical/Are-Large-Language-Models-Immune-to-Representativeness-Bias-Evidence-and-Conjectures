To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a specific numerical value, we need prior probabilities, which represent the baseline likelihood of a graduate student being in a particular field, as well as the likelihood of a graduate student having Adam's personality sketch given that they are in a certain field (\( P(E|H) \)). Without access to specific prior probabilities, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood based on the given description. 

Based on Adam’s traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature,
- Enjoying puzzles,
- Warm heart and empathy,
- Deep love for animals,
- High intelligence and good abstract thinking,
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication,

Here is a qualitative estimation of the conditional probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**: 

    While business administration students can be intelligent and appreciate hard work and dedication, Adam’s pronounced love for nature, animals, and puzzles, along with strong empathy, seem less directly aligned with the typical traits and motivations related to business administration.

    Therefore, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) seems lower.

2. **Computer Science**: 

    Adam’s enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts are well-aligned with the field of computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals might not be strongly correlated with a typical computer science student.

    Therefore, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) could be somewhat moderate.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities would roughly be:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Again, these are approximate values based on qualitative assessment rather than precise calculations with specific data inputs.
