To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, calculating the exact values of these probabilities requires specific information about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the overall probabilities of being enrolled in each field), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probabilities of exhibiting the personality sketch given enrollment in each field), and the evidence \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch itself). Since precise numerical values for these are not provided, we will make informed estimates based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge about these fields.

For each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - People working in computer science often have high intelligence and an aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's characteristics. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is likely to be relatively high.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) should also be reasonable because computer science has a high enrollment rate among graduate students in recent years.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - While problem-solving and intelligence are valuable in business administration, the emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy is less typical. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be lower.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) should be substantial since business administration also attracts many graduate students.

Depending on the above qualitative assessments, we can estimate the probabilities. Let's assign relative estimates:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \text{high likelihood given strong alignment with traits relevant to computer science} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \text{moderate likelihood as some traits less aligned with typical business administration roles} \]

Let's quantify this with a plausible but not precise numerical estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adamâ€™s personality sketch aligns more strongly with traits commonly associated with computer science than with business administration, but without exact numeric priors and likelihoods, these values are best interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.
