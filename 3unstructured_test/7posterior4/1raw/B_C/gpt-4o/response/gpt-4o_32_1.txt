To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \)

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, then adjust it by the prior \( P(H) \) for each field. Since we do not have specific priors or exact likelihoods given explicitly, we will use reasonable qualitative assessments based on the provided information. These assessments are subjective estimates and are meant to reflect the likelihood that a person with Adam's personality traits would enroll in a particular field.

Let's break it down:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \)**: Lower, as Adam's described interests don't align strongly with common traits seen in business administration.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \)**: Also likely lower, as business administration generally requires some extroversion, leadership ambition, and interest in economics, which aren't highlighted in Adam's traits.
   
   Combining these, we get a lower posterior probability for business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \)**: Higher, as students in computer science often show high intelligence, curiosity about nature, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of abstract concepts.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)**: Higher, matching well with Adam's traits of enjoying puzzles, having a quiet nature, and being high in abstract reasoning.

   Combining these, we get a higher posterior probability for computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimates meant to reflect the relative likelihoods based on the qualitative information provided and should not be taken as precise calculations.
