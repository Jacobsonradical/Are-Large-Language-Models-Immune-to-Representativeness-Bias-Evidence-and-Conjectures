To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being in each field, \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of Adam having his described traits given that he is in each field, \( P(E|H) \). However, since the priors \( P(H) \) are not provided, I'll assume them to be equal for simplicity. Please note that these are educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the probability of having the given traits) is the same for both cases and we assume equal priors, \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to \( P(E|H) \).

Let's evaluate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Commonly attracts individuals with strong leadership, management, and communication skills.
   - Empathy and understanding are relevant but curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less directly related.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is probably low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Attracts people with high intelligence, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
   - Curiosity and solving puzzles align well with this field.
   - Empathy and love for animals might be less directly related but don't contradict typical traits.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is quite high.

Given the qualitative assessment:
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is low.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is high.

To put this into the requested format without actual numerical values for prior probabilities and exact likelihoods:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Please note these values are illustrative estimates based on the qualitative analysis provided. For precise calculation, actual statistical data or more detailed context would be needed.
