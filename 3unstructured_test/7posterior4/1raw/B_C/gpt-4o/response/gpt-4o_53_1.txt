To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we should use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the information provided, we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch and the likely compatibility with each field of study.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer Science requires strong abstract thinking, puzzle-solving skills, and high intelligenceâ€”traits that Adam has.
   - Adam's empathy and love for animals might not directly connect to typical computer science fields unless he is involved in developing technology related to wildlife or environmental science.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - Business Administration often involves working with people, leadership, and understanding business frameworks. While Adam has a warm heart and strong empathy, these traits might be more ancillary rather than central to this field.
   - The abstract thinking and intelligence required for solving business problems could align, but his passion for nature and animals is less directly related to Business Administration.
  
Based on this qualitative assessment, Adam seems more likely to pursue a field where his love for abstraction, puzzles, and possibly nature or animal-related technology could be pertinent. Thus, we could lean slightly more towards computer science.

Here is a representation in the required JSON format based on qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Again, these values are not derived from precise computations but rather from a qualitative assessment of the information provided. The actual probabilities would require detailed data and prior probabilities, which are not provided in this scenario.
