Bayes' rule allows us to compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) of a hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \(P(H|E)\) for the given fields, we would need the following:
1. \(P(H)\) - The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
2. \(P(E|H)\) - The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. \(P(E)\) - The overall probability of the evidence.

We don't have specific statistical data to precisely calculate these values, so we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch. Let's consider the fields mentioned and how they align with Adam's interests and characteristics. Given Adam's traits, we can make educated guesses about \(P(E|H)\) for each field.

### Computer Science
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Assume a neutral prior, as we don't have specific comparative enrollment data. Let's assume a prior probability of 0.2 (20%) for being in computer science.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work. These are strong indicators for computer science, so let's assign a high probability, say 0.8 (80%).
   
### Business Administration
1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Assume a prior probability of 0.1 (10%) for being in business administration.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's empathy and warm heart fit some aspects of business administration, like managing and understanding people, but they are not as aligned with the analytical and abstract interests described in E. Therefore, let's assign a moderate likelihood, say 0.3 (30%).

Since \(P(E)\) is the same across fields and primarily used for normalization, and we are comparing relative probabilities, we do not need to compute it explicitly for this comparison.

Using Bayes' rule without the normalization factor \(P(E)\):

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Thus, the computed posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
