To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can make educated assumptions to compare the relative likelihoods.

First, let's consider the evidence \( E \):
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Business Administration
- Curiosity about nature and plants is not directly related to business administration.
- Enjoying solving puzzles can be a beneficial trait in business but is not specific to it.
- Warm heart and strong empathy might be useful but are not primary traits sought in business administration.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are valuable but not decisively indicative of business administration.
- Appreciation for hard work is relevant but common across many fields.

Overall, based on these points, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) seems low to moderate.

### Computer Science
- Curiosity about nature and plants is not particularly indicative of computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles is highly relevant to computer science.
- Warm heart and empathy are valuable but secondary traits for computer scientists.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are crucial in computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant and necessary in computer science.

Overall, based on these points, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) seems moderate to high.

Given these observations, here's a rough estimation of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates take into account the strengths of the evidence in relation to the fields. Note that these values are not exact but provide a comparison of the likelihoods given the personality traits described.
