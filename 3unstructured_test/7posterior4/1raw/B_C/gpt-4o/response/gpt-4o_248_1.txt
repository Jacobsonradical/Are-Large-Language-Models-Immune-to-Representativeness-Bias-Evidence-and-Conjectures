To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

We don't have actual numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make informed qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch and common attributes of students in different fields. 

Let's break this down for each field:

### Business Administration
1. **P(E|H)**: Business administration generally emphasizes leadership, communication, and strategic thinking. While someone in business administration can have curiosity about nature, empathy, and intelligence, these traits might be less emphasized compared to leadership and strategic decision-making. So, the match might be moderate to low.
  
2. **P(H)**: This reflects how common it is for someone to enroll in business administration. Business administration programs are fairly common, so this prior might be moderate to high.

Considering these factors:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for business administration} \approx 0.2 \]

### Computer Science
1. **P(E|H)**: Traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts align very well with computer science. Additionally, a quiet demeanor fits the stereotype of someone in computer science more naturally than business administration.
  
2. **P(H)**: Computer science is also a popular field of study, especially among those with analytical minds.

Given the strong alignment with Adam's traits:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for computer science} \approx 0.7 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
