To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we lack specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can nonetheless use qualitative reasoning about how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical profiles in different fields. We'll make some assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally, this field attracts individuals who are more interested in commerce, management, and organizational leadership.
   - The emphasis is often on practical and social skills rather than solving abstract concepts or having a deep empathy for nature and animals.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(E|H_{business}) \) might be relatively low, as Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, abstract reasoning) do not align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration student.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - This field attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have strong analytical and abstract thinking skills.
   - Empathy and a love for nature are not primary indicators but do not conflict with being in computer science.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be relatively high, as Adam's traits (solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align well with the profile of a computer science student.

By using these assumptions, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities:

Based on the qualitative analysis alone, we can approximate:

\( P(H_{business}|E) \approx 0.1 \) – This reflects a lower fit between Adam's personality and business administration.

\( P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.6 \) – This reflects a higher fit between Adam's personality and computer science.

These values do not sum to 1 because we are not considering all possible fields, and this is a qualitative estimate based on alignment rather than precise calculations.

So, the answer in the requested format is:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These are approximations based on reasoning about the fit between Adam's personality and the typical expectations in each field. The actual values could vary with more precise data.
