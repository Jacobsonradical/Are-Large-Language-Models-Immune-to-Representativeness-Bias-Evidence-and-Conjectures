To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we utilize Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \). \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing his personality traits given he is in a specific field \( H \). \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which can be interpreted as the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all possible fields.

Since we don't have precise numerical values for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on characteristics and general knowledge:

1. **Computer Science**: The traits such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and strong understanding of hard work align well with fields that require analytical thinking and problem-solving, such as computer science.

2. **Business Administration**: While some traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work can fit, business administration typically also emphasizes skills less highlighted in Adam's sketch, such as leadership and public speaking. 

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to make qualitative assessments of (a) how well Adam's profile fits each field \( P(E|H) \) and (b) how common each field is among graduate students \( P(H) \). Let's assign some qualitative likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) for Computer Science might be high (around 0.7 - 0.8).
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) for Business Administration might be moderate (around 0.3 - 0.4).

Assume equal prior probabilities \( P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{ba}) = 0.5 \) for simplicity and given no other context:

- For Computer Science: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.75 \times 0.5 = 0.375 \)
- For Business Administration: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.35 \times 0.5 = 0.175 \)

Given these qualitative sums, the total evidence \( P(E) = 0.375 + 0.175 = 0.55 \).

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.375}{0.55} \approx 0.68 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.55} \approx 0.32 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities could be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.68,
  "business administration": 0.32
}
```

Keep in mind that these values are based on qualitative assumptions, as precise numerical data is absent.
