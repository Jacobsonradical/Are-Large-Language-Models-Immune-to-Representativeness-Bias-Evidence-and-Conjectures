To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing the given personality traits given enrollment in each field. However, as the problem does not provide specific numerical values for the priors or likelihoods, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on our understanding.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given the nature of Adam's personality sketch, we can hypothesize which field is more likely:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Higher likelihood given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts.
   - Lower likelihood given his strong empathy and warm-heartedness, which are not necessarily associated with a typical computer science profile but still possible.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Lesser likelihood given Adam's quiet nature and strong empathy, which are not typical of business administration students who often engage in networking and have leadership qualities.
   - Higher likelihood of an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these considerations and absent specific numerical values, we can provide qualitative estimates based on these reasoning steps. 

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}

These values reflect that Adam is somewhat more likely to be enrolled in computer science given his problem-solving abilities and interest in abstract concepts, although his empathy and appreciation for hard work also make business administration a non-negligible possibility.
