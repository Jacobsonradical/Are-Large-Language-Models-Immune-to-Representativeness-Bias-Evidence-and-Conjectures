To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior conditional probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which is the same for all hypotheses \( H \) being compared and can be treated as a normalization factor.

Assuming:
- \( E \) indicates strong traits such as love for nature, animals, puzzles, high intelligence, and empathy.
- \( H_1 \) = Business Administration.
- \( H_2 \) = Computer Science.

Let's make logical assumptions about the likelihoods and priors based on the typical graduate student demographics and Adam's personality traits.

1. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability for Business Administration.
   - Typically, Business Administration students might not need to exhibit a deep love for nature, animals, and empathy to the extent described.

2. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - \( P(H_2) \) is the prior probability for Computer Science.
   - Computer Science students often exhibit traits like enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, which align more closely with Adam's personality.

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(H_1) \approx 0.15 \) (based on the overall proportion of graduate students in Business Administration).
- \( P(H_2) \approx 0.25 \) (based on the overall proportion of graduate students in Computer Science).

For the likelihoods:
- Let \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.05 \) (since traits like empathy and a strong love for nature/animals are less correlated with Business Administration).
- Let \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.30 \) (since liking puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align closely with Computer Science).

Using Bayes' Rule:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, since \( P(E) \) is common and acts as a normalizing factor, we are looking at the numerators:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.30 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \]

We'll normalize these to get the posterior conditional probabilities:

Sum of numerators:
\[ 0.0075 + 0.075 = 0.0825 \]

Normalized posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.0075}{0.0825} \approx 0.0909 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.0825} \approx 0.9091 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0909,
  "computer science": 0.9091
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood, given Adam's personality sketch, that he was enrolled in either Business Administration or Computer Science as a graduate student in 2021.
