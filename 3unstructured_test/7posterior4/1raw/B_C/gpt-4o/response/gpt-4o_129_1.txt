To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to recognize that Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis (e.g., Adam was enrolled in a given field).
- \( E \) is the evidence (the personality sketch of Adam).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given the context of the problem, we'll qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: This is less relevant to business administration.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: While beneficial in any field, it is not a primary trait for business administration.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Applicable but not unique to business administration.

Given Adam's strong love for nature and animals, and his interest in solving puzzles, these characteristics core to the sketch don't strongly align with typical traits emphasized in business administration.

Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively lower.

### Computer Science
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Strongly relevant to computer science, which often involves problem-solving.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Highly pertinent to computer science where computational thinking and abstract reasoning are key.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: While beneficial anywhere, empathy can be particularly relevant for human-centric fields in computer science like human-computer interaction or software development.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Less directly relevant but could manifest in fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling within computer science.

Given these aspects, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be relatively higher.

**Priors:**
Without specific priors provided, we might assume equal initial probabilities for simplicity, though demographic enrollment data could adjust this.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \), the posterior probabilities will be proportional to the likelihoods.

Therefore, we can qualitatively conclude:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:
The number values are estimated based on a qualitative reasoning that aligns the personality sketch more strongly with computer science (high relevance of problem-solving and abstract reasoning) compared to business administration, where the core personality traits described are less directly applicable. Adjustments could be made if actual prior probabilities or additional information were provided.
