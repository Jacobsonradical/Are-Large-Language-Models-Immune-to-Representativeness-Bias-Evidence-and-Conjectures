Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in different graduate fields using Bayes' rule. However, to compute these probabilities precisely, we would need detailed information on the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each hypothesis. I’ll make some assumptions based on the provided information to offer plausible values.

Let:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) be the likelihood of Adam having these characteristics given he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) be the likelihood of Adam having these characteristics given he is in business administration.
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) be the prior probability of someone being in computer science.
- \( P(H_{ba}) \) be the prior probability of someone being in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) be the overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics.

With limited detailed data, I’ll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H_{cs}) \) and \( P(H_{ba}) \) are equal for simplification, although in reality, they could be different based on graduate enrollment statistics.

Given Adam's characteristics:

1. High intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts might be a good fit for computer science (which often deals with problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and abstract computations).
2. His love for nature and animals might make him more inclined to fields like biology, environmental science, etc., but this specific sketch doesn't strongly lean towards business administration.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For computer science, let’s assume:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is relatively high because his skills and interests align well with this field.

For business administration, let’s assume:
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) is relatively low because the personality sketch provided does not strongly correlate with typical business administration traits (which might include leadership, management, and finance-oriented skills).

Without exact values, we can arbitrarily assign some plausible values while noting these assumptions:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values represent educated guesses rather than precise calculations and are based on the perceived alignment of Adam's characteristics with each field. The actual values could vary with more data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
