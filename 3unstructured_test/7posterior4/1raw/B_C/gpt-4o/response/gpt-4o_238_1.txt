To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field. However, since we are not given specific numerical values for these probabilities, I can provide qualitative reasoning to suggest which field is more likely for Adam based on his personality sketch.

### Reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are traits commonly associated with computer science.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of the field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy and understanding/appreciation for hard work can be beneficial, but these traits are more general and less directly tied to the specific skills typically required for business administration.
   - A deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature might be less aligned with the business-focused curriculum.

Given the qualitative assessment, Adam seems more aligned with computer science. Quantifying this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values represent a higher likelihood for Adam to have been enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
