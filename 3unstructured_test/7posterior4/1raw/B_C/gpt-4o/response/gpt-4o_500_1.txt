To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack specific numerical values for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), priors \( P(H) \), and evidence \( P(E) \). Instead, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on how well Adam's characteristics fit the typical profiles of each field.

### Qualitative Analysis

1. **Business Administration**:
    - While intelligence and problem-solving are useful in business administration, Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't heavily align with typical traits necessary for business administration. The field tends to value leadership, strategic thinking, and social networking more.
    - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Adamâ€™s attributes like high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are very well matched with the common traits found in computer science students or professionals.
    - While his empathy and love for animals might not be directly related to computer science, they do not negate the likelihood. His curiosity about nature could extend to a curiosity about systems and algorithms, which are important in computer science.
    - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be relatively high.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can make a qualitative comparison:

- The fit for computer science is much higher than for business administration.

This leads us to qualitatively estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's personality fits the field of computer science compared to business administration, considering his described characteristics.
