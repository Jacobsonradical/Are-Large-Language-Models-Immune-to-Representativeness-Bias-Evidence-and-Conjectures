To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field as well as the likelihood of having the given personality traits given that he is in each field. However, without specific priors and likelihoods, only an approximate interpretation can be derived based on qualitative reasoning. 

Given Adam's personality traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, empathy, appreciation for hard work—and the fact that he was a graduate student in 2021, we can qualitatively assess which fields might be more likely.

### Computer Science
A graduate student in computer science typically needs strong problem-solving skills, high intelligence to understand abstract concepts, and an appreciation for hard work. While Adam's interest in nature and animals isn't directly relevant, his intelligence and problem-solving abilities do align well.

### Business Administration
Business administration students are often driven by leadership, management skills, and an understanding of organizational behavior. Empathy and appreciation for dedication might fit, but the specific interests in nature, animals, and puzzling-solving don’t align as closely with typical business administration profiles.

Given this qualitative reasoning:

- Adam’s personality traits align moderately well with computer science due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
- They align less well with business administration.

As a result, we'll assign higher but not definitive probabilities to computer science and lower probabilities to business administration. Mathematically:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the subjective belief based on the qualitative matching of the personality traits to typical profiles within the given fields. More precise probabilities would require actual data on the prevalence of these traits among students in these fields.
