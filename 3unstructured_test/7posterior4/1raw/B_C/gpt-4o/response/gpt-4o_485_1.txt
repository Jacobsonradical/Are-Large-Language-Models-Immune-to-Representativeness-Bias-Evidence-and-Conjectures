To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have the actual numerical data for the priors or likelihoods, I will provide a qualitative estimation based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical attributes of students in each field.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability (P(CS))**: Let's assume the prior probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science is relatively high given the popularity of the field.

**Likelihood (P(E|CS))**:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with Computer Science.
- Enjoying puzzles is often a sign of problem-solving skills, which is crucial in CS.
 
Considering these points, the likelihood is moderate to high, but it's less aligned with his strong empathy and love for animals unless he's working on something like AI for animal welfare or environmental tech.

**Posterior Probability (P(CS|E))**:
Given the alignment in some aspects, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior probability as moderate.

### Business Administration

**Prior Probability (P(BA))**: The prior probability of a graduate student studying Business Administration is also reasonable, given the ubiquity of the field.

**Likelihood (P(E|BA))**:
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well.
- However, strong empathy and a deep love for animals are not primary characteristics typically associated with a business administration curriculum.
- Understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence are good fits.

**Posterior Probability (P(BA|E))**:
Given that Adam's empathy and love for nature don't strongly align with Business Administration, the posterior probability should be lower than that of Computer Science.

Here are the qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values represent a qualitative approach to estimating the probabilities. Actual numerical values would require specific data on priors and likelihoods.
