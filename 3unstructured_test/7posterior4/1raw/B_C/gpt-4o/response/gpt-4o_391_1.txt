To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (H) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the expression:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without precise values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we need to make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch. 

Given the description in the personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, which suggests a possible interest in fields like biology, ecology, environmental science, or similar.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, which align with fields requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, like computer science.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, which suggest fields focused on helping or studying living beings, like medicine, veterinary sciences, psychology, or related fields.
4. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be relevant in any graduate field, but does not particularly hint towards business administration.

Given this data, we can infer approximate likelihoods \( P(E|H_x) \):

### Computer Science
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): High, due to puzzle-solving, abstract concepts, and high intelligence.
- Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assumed to be moderate, as computer science is a common graduate field.

### Business Administration
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Lower, given there's no specific behavior or trait in E suggesting a strong inclination toward business administration.
- Prior probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Also moderate, as it's a common graduate field, but not particularly inferred from Adam's personality.

Letâ€™s estimate:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \]

We will not calculate the denominator \( P(E) \), as it is the same for all fields and we are not required to normalize.

Therefore, the approximate values (non-normalized) for \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

In summary, based on the personality sketch, it seems more likely that Adam was enrolled in a field like computer science rather than business administration.
