To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch, we will use Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are not given. Instead, I will provide an educated estimate based on Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics of fields of study.

### Estimations

#### Business Administration:
- **Empathy and love for animals** are not primary skills in business administration.
- **Curiosity about nature and plants** is also not particularly indicative of a business focus.
- **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** is relevant, but not distinctive to business administration.
- **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles** may not strongly align with the general perception of dynamic and social environments in business administration.
Estimated likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \)

#### Computer Science:
- **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts** are highly relevant.
- **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles** is a good fit.
- Empathy and love for animals don't strongly align but don't contradict it either.
- **Curiosity about nature** Can be related to data science or computational biology within computer science.
Estimated likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \)

Since we don't have actual prior probabilities and \( P(E) \) (the marginal likelihood of E across all fields), we'll assume these fields are equally likely as a rough baseline.

### Calculation:

Given equal priors and our rough estimates:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) \]

Using equal priors for simplification:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \]

### Estimations of Posterior Probabilities:
- Normalization factor doesn't impact individual comparisons directly due to equal priors assumptions.

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3
\]

To maintain individual comparability without normalization, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
