To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to know or reasonably estimate the following probabilities:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in a given field (before considering the personality sketch).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the personality sketch, regardless of field.

Bayes’ rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we have no prior information about the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each specific field, we can treat the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) as being roughly equal across fields (though in reality, these would vary based on various factors). Let's focus on estimating the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

### Estimating Likelihoods:
- **Business Administration:**
  - It is less likely that someone with a strong love for nature, empathy for animals, and high interest in abstract concepts would enroll in Business Administration. We might estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) to be quite low.

- **Computer Science:**
  - It is more plausible that someone who enjoys solving puzzles, understands abstract concepts, and has a high intelligence might enroll in Computer Science. We might estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) to be higher.

Given these considerations, let's assign some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \)

### Prior Probabilities:
Assuming equal priors for simplicity:
- \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)

### Evidence Calculation:
Since we’re focusing only on “business administration” and “computer science,” we'll treat the evidence as proportional to these two fields:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.5) + (0.7 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 + 0.35 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.4 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.125 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.875 \]

### Final Results:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.875
}
