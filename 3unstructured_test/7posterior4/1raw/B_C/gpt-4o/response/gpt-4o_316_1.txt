To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a simplified step-by-step process for estimating \( P(H|E) \), leveraging reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities and evidence likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in each field before we know anything about his personality.
  
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing his personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: This is the normalization factor, ensuring that the probabilities sum up to 1 across all hypotheses. Since you don't need your total to add up to 1, we can ignore this for relative comparison.

We can assume:
- The prior probability of a student being in business administration is lower compared to other fields like computer science, given the range of possible grad fields in 2021.
- The nature of Adamâ€™s personality might be more aligned with computer science due to his affinity for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.

Given these reasonable assumptions, here are our rough estimates for the conditional probabilities:

\[
\text{Prior (P(H)) for Business Administration} = 0.1 \quad \text{(lower priority)}
\]
\[
\text{Prior (P(H)) for Computer Science} = 0.2 \quad \text{(higher priority due to nature alignment)}
\]

\[
\text{Likelihood (P(E|H)) for Business Administration} \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(less likely for nature and puzzles)}
\]
\[
\text{Likelihood (P(E|H)) for Computer Science} \approx 0.8 \quad \text{(more likely due to nature and puzzles)}
\]

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.16}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and we are comparing relative values:

\[
\text{{Relative Probability for Business}} \approx 0.01
\]
\[
\text{{Relative Probability for Computer Science}} \approx 0.16
\]

So accordingly, we can normalize these relative probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx 0.01 \quad (\text{normalized assumption})
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.16 \quad (\text{normalized surprising weighting})
\]

Given the values:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}
```

(Note: The values provided are approximations and for conceptual purposes. Actual computations would necessitate more precise priors and data-specific likelihoods.)
