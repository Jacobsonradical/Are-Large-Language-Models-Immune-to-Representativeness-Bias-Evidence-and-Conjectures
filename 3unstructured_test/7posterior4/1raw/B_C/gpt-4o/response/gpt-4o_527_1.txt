To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some background probabilities and likelihoods. Here is how Bayes' rule is applied:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Without exact values for the priors and likelihoods, I'll provide qualitative estimations based on Adam's personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch \( E \):

1. **Computer Science** - Adam has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. He has a quiet disposition and enjoys solving puzzles. Considering these traits align well with a computer science field, we can assume a reasonably high likelihood.

2. **Business Administration** - While Adam has warm heartedness, a strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, which can be relevant to business administration, these traits are less specifically matched with common expectations for a business administration graduate where soft skills, leadership, and people management might be more emphasized.

That said, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values are approximations reflecting that Adam's personality and interests seem more aligned with a field that involves intellectual challenge and abstract thinking, such as computer science, while less strongly aligned with business administration.
