To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first recognize that direct numerical computation requires prior probabilities and likelihoods that are not provided in the problem. However, we can give a qualitative assessment based on how well Adam's personality sketch fits with typical characteristics one might expect from graduate students in each field.

Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants might suggest a leaning towards fields like biology, environmental science, or botany, rather than computer science or business administration.
- Quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, and good at understanding abstract concepts could align well with computer science.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might be more indicative of fields related to animal science, veterinary studies, or even psychology, rather than business administration.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is a quality that is fairly general and can apply to many fields, including both computer science and business administration.

Given this qualitative assessment and the general characteristics typically associated with each field, here is a reasoned estimation:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are not precise but meant to reflect a reasoned judgment based on how well Adam's characteristics align with typical profiles in these fields.
