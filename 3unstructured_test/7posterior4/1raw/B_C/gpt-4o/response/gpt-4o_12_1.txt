To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand all the components. 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given that we have no explicit numerical values for the priors or likelihoods, we can rely on qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch to assign rough estimations:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Less likely on the basis that business administration might not directly align well with Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts. 
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Low because the personality traits don't strongly match what you might stereotype as common for business administration students, who may often prioritize leadership, networking, and applied business strategies over abstract thinking and strong empathy for nature.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Reasonably likely. Computer science would fit well with Adam’s interest in solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence. 
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** High due to the alignment with the strong analytical and problem-solving skills often seen in computer science students.

Therefore, using these qualitative assessments, we can reasonably assign the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** The fit with Adam’s personality sketch is not strong; thus, the probability is low.
- **Computer Science (0.7):** Adam's characteristics highly align with those required in the field of computer science, making it a stronger candidate.
