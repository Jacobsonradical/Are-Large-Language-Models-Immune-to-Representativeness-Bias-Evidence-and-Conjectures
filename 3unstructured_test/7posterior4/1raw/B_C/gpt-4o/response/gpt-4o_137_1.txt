To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider a few components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field before considering the personality sketch. For simplicity, we can assume equal priors for business administration and computer science unless specified otherwise.
   
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each specified field.

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \). However, since we are comparing relative probabilities, we don't need this exact value; it will be the same for both fields and thus cancels out when comparing.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Now let's estimate the values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    Assuming equal priors:
    \[ P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - For **business administration**:
      The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are not typical strong indicators for business administration. Therefore, let's estimate a low likelihood:
      \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \]

    - For **computer science**:
      The personality traits such as intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align more with computer science. Therefore, we can estimate a higher likelihood:
      \[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.6 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) cancels out for comparison, we get
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) cancels out for comparison, we get
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Note that these values are relative and assume equal priors. If the actual prior probabilities differ, the calculations would need to adjust accordingly.
