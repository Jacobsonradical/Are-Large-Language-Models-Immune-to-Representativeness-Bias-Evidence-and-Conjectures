To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field, as well as the prior probabilities of students enrolling in each field. However, since prior probabilities and specific likelihoods might not be readily available, I will provide a qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics of each field.

Here's how we can tackle it:

1. **Likelihoods**: We look at the traits and estimate how likely these traits are for someone in each of the given fields.
2. **Priors**: The general popularity and enrollment rates in each of these fields would typically form our priors. 

For simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities are equally likely since we do not have specific data on enrollment distributions.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for dedication, let's qualitatively determine estimates.

### Business Administration
- Traits like empathy and understanding hard work might tangent to business administration.
- However, his love for animals and nature seems less aligned with typical business administration curricula.
Let's assign a lower qualitative probability here.

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
- Solving puzzles also aligns with common interests in computer science.
- His curiosity and love for animals/nature might be less directly relevant but do not conflict strongly.

Given these qualitative observations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These are rough estimations based on the given personality traits. Specific data about enrollment and trait distribution would yield more precise calculations.
