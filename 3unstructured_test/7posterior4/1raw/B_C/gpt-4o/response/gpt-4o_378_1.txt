To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since the priors and likelihoods for each graduate field are not provided in the question, I'll assume reasonable values based on typical attributes and characteristics associated with students in those fields. 

Let:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \) and \( P(\text{business administration}) \) be the prior probabilities of a graduate student being in each respective field. 
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) and \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) be the probabilities of the personality sketch \( E \) given each respective field.

For computer science:
- Computer science students often enjoy solving puzzles, and are of high intelligence with good understanding of abstract concepts. Therefore, we'll assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) is relatively high.

For business administration:
- Business administration students may also value understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, but not necessarily align strongly with the specific interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts as described for Adam. Thus, we'll assign \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) a lower value in comparison to computer science.

Based on these assumptions, let’s estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)

Assume the prior probabilities (without detailed data, assume equal priors for simplicity):
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

According to Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant to ensure probabilities add up to 1.

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now compute the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
