To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, I would need detailed prior probabilities and likelihoods for Adam enrolling in each specific field based on his personality sketch. Since those specific numerical values are not provided, I will offer a qualitative assessment instead.

Here’s how Bayes' rule works:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, representing the overall probability of observing Adam's personality across all fields.

Based on Adam's described profile:
- **Business Administration**: This field typically requires a strong interest in management, leadership, money flow, and decision-making processes in business environments. While Adam's empathy and understanding of hard work could be attributes benefiting this field, his strong curiosity in nature, deep love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles are not particularly emphasized in business.
  - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Generally common but Adam's profile fits less directly to this field.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Lower compared to fields involving nature, animals, or puzzles.
  
- **Computer Science**: This field requires analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to understand abstract concepts—all of which align strongly with Adam's intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work. Curiosity about nature and empathy can also fit into fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and bioinformatics.
  - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Common among students with Adam's traits.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Higher than for business administration, given the match in problem-solving and abstract thinking.

Given these qualitative insights and without specific numerical data, here's an estimated qualitative ranking:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality seems more strongly aligned with the attributes beneficial for a computer science field over business administration, although he could still potentially be in either field.
