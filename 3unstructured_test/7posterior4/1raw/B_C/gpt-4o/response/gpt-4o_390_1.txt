Explanation:

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it's likely he would be attracted to a field like computer science, which requires these skills.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's traits such as empathy, love for nature, and animals might not align as strongly with the typical requirements and nature of a business administration program, which generally focuses more on organizational, financial, and leadership skills.

Given these qualitative assessments, the calculated probabilities are:

- **Computer Science**: 0.65
- **Business Administration**: 0.05
