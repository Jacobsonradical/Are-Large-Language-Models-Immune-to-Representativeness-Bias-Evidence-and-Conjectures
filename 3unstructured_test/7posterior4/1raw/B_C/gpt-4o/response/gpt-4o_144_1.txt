To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), we can only make a qualitative assessment.

Let's consider the personalities typical for each field and how well Adam's personality sketch (E) fits into those fields.

### Computer Science

- Graduate students in computer science often have a strong aptitude for abstract thinking and problem-solving, which aligns with Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Curiosity about nature and enjoying solving puzzles fit well because a lot of computer science involves solving complex problems and algorithms.

### Business Administration

- Business administration students tend to have strong interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and often an interest in markets and economics.
- While Adam's strong empathy and warm heart can be valuable in business settings, his love for animals and nature, puzzle-solving preference, and reserved demeanor might not align as directly with typical characteristics of those who pursue business administration degrees.

Given these qualitative assessments, it's likely that Adam's interests and personality traits align more closely with computer science than business administration.

Using this qualitative analysis, we can conclude:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values are illustrative and reflect that Adam's personality is more consistent with what is typically expected of computer science students compared to business administration students. For precise quantitative probabilities, actual data on the base rates (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) would be necessary.
