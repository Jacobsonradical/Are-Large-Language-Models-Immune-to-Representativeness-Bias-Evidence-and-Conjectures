To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \(P(E|H)\), the prior probability of the hypothesis \(P(H)\), and the overall probability of the evidence \(P(E)\). 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will need to reason qualitatively based on the personality sketch provided for Adam.

**Computer Science:**
- Adam has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science.
- His interest in solving puzzles also fits with the problem-solving skills required in computer science.
- However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals might have a weaker connection to this field unless he is applying computer science to domains like artificial intelligence in animal behavior or bioinformatics.

**Business Administration:**
- His genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration.
- Business administration generally requires strong interpersonal skills and leadership qualities. While Adam has a warm heart and strong empathy, there is no mention of the extroverted or persuasive nature often associated with business leadership roles.

Given these qualitative assessments, the likelihood of Adam being in computer science seems higher compared to business administration due to the alignment of his traits with the skills required in computer science, particularly the appreciation of abstract concepts and problem-solving.

Therefore, let us estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect higher posterior probability for computer science based on the given personality sketch of Adam, acknowledging there could be other fields of specialization as well.
