To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)) and the prior probability of the hypothesis (\( P(H) \)). However, without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will have to make reasonable qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields.

### Computer Science
Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are strongly associated with computer science. Additionally, curiosity about nature and understanding abstract concepts could translate to algorithmic thinking.

### Business Administration
While Adam has a warm heart and strong empathy, traits which can be beneficial in business administration, other key characteristics like curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typically associated with this field. Additionally, his appreciation for hard work and dedication is a neutral factor, as it applies broadly.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to approximate the conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}

Note: The values generated are based on qualitative reasoning rather than specific statistical data. For more precise probabilities, detailed prior distributions and likelihood functions would be essential.
