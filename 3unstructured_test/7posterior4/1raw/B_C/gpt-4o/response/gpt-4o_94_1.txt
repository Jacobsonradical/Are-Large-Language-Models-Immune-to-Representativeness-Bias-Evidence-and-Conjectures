To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration" using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. \( P(H) \): the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): the marginal likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only qualitatively reason through them based on the provided sketch and the general knowledge of these fields.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- Enjoys nature and plants (likely associated with fields like environmental science or biology but not ruled out in others)
- Solves puzzles (possibly aligns with computer science)
- Warm heart and empathy (potentially a good fit for fields involving interaction with people or animals, such as psychology, social work, or veterinary sciences, but not business administration inherently)
- Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (commendable in computer science)
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication (applies broadly)

Assuming that:
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for "computer science" may be higher because solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for "business administration" may be somewhat lower as the empathy and animals aspects are not directly linked.

Let's assume some hypothetical prior probabilities for demonstration:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

And subjective assessments of likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

To compute:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we don't have \( P(E) \), we will assume it normalizes correctly. For practical purposes, the relative values are the focus.

So:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Thus, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities, based on the given personality sketch, would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.04
}
```
