To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to utilize the relation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch.

Here, we assume the prior probabilities and likelihoods are based on general knowledge about the alignment of personality traits with fields of study, as we do not have specific data. 

Letâ€™s consider generic values for the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability that a computer science student has Adam's characteristics (quiet, enjoys puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts). Given that computer science often attracts individuals with these traits, this value might be relatively high.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability that a business administration student has Adam's characteristics (warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, strong appreciation for hard work). While empathy and appreciation might be found among business students, the alignment with solving puzzles and nature is less strong.

For prior probabilities:
- Without specific data, we'll use a rough assumption based on the prevalence of graduate fields. If we base the priors evenly across many possible fields, they might be quite similar.

Thus:
- For computer science: \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be relatively high, and the prior \( P(H_{CS}) \) is moderate.
- For business administration: \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be moderate or low, and the prior \( P(H_{BA}) \) is also moderate.

To implement these intuitions into approximate values:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are educated guesses, reflecting how strongly we believe Adam's personality aligns with each field, given the attributes specified in the sketch.
