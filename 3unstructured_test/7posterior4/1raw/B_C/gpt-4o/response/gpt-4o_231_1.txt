To determine the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in Business Administration or Computer Science given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \). Therefore, we have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch provided. 

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The traits mentioned in the sketch do not strongly align with a typical Business Administration student profile, as Business Administration often attracts individuals who are more outwardly focused, communicative, and possibly more interested in human systems and organizational behavior rather than nature, puzzles, or abstract concepts.
   - **P(H)**: Given the number and nature of business programs, it is common.
   - Combining the above factors, the likelihood that Adam fits into Business Administration is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The sketch fits well with traits typically seen in Computer Science students. These include intelligence, abstract reasoning, puzzle-solving, empathy (important in collaborative and ethical tech work), and a quiet disposition which is often seen in tech fields.
   - **P(H)**: Given the high number of graduates in Computer Science with a range of interests and personality types, the probability that Adam fits into this category is relatively higher.
   
Without exact numeric values, we can make a qualitative estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimations based purely on qualitative judgments tied to the personality sketch. In a real-world scenario, precise calculations would require empirical data on the likelihood of the personality traits given each field and the overall probability of students enrolling in each field.
