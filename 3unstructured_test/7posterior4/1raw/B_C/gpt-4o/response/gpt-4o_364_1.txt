To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make some assumptions based on the description provided.

The evidence \( E \) includes:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Being a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
6. Being a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Given the evidence, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods for each field:

- **Computer Science:**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low alignment.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High alignment.
  - Warm heart and empathy: Neutral.
  - Love for animals: Low alignment.
  - High intelligence and abstract concepts: High alignment.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Generally applicable.

- **Business Administration:**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low alignment.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Medium alignment (could relate to strategic thinking).
  - Warm heart and empathy: Useful in leadership, medium alignment.
  - Love for animals: Low alignment.
  - High intelligence and abstract concepts: Medium alignment.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Generally applicable.

Without specific numerical values, we'll qualitatively estimate the probabilities based on the alignment between the evidence and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \), \( P(H_{BA}) \), and \( P(E) \) are approximately equal for simplicity, but with prior knowledge that Computer Science and Business Administration are common areas of graduate study, maybe equally likely. We will use a qualitative approach:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.7):** Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts align strongly with the typical profile of a computer science student.
- **Business Administration (0.3):** While Adam's empathy and appreciation of hard work align somewhat with business administration, other aspects (like curiosity about nature and love for animals) are less aligned with this field.

The values given are not exact and are subject to further refinement with more specific information about the base rates (prior probabilities \( P(H) \)) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).
