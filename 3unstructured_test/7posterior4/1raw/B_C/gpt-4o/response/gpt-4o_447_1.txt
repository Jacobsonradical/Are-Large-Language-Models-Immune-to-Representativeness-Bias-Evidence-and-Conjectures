To compute the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need not only the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) but also the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). However, since we do not have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each graduate field, we will have to make assumptions based on general knowledge of graduate fields and Adam's personality.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
For the simplification, we assume \( P(E) \) to be a normalizing constant which ensures the probabilities across all considered hypotheses sum up to 1.

Given Adam's personality sketch, consider the following likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication which could be relevant.
   - He has a high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which could be helpful in business administration.
   - However, curiosity about nature, empathy, and a deep love for animals are less typical of a business administration background.

   Given these points, \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) might be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which are strong indicators for a computer science background.
   - His understanding of abstract concepts is highly relevant to computer science.
   - Empathy and a love for animals are not directly relevant but do not contradict the traits valuable in computer science.

   Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be higher compared to business administration.

Considering the above, and assuming prior probabilities to be roughly equal across different graduate fields (for simplicity), the posterior probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are estimates based on qualitative matching of Adamâ€™s characteristics with typical traits relevant to each field.
