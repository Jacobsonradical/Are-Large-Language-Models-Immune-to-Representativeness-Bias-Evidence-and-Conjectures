To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the information provided, we don't have enough specific data for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) to calculate precise probabilities. Instead, we can make an educated guess based on the personality sketch.

Adam's qualities are:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles 
- Warm heart, strong empathy, loves animals 
- High intelligence, understands abstract concepts 
- Values hard work and dedication

Using these traits, let's evaluate how likely Adam would be enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (highly relevant to CS)
   - High intelligence and understands abstract concepts (relevant to CS)
   - Quiet (often a trait found in computer science professionals)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy and warm heart (can be relevant to MBA but less critical compared to CS spectrum)
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication (quite relevant but not unique to MBA)

Considering the relevance of Adam's traits to each field, we can hypothesize the following rough estimates:

For computer science:
- High likelihood given Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.

For business administration:
- Lower likelihood compared to computer science given his quiet demeanor and primary interest in nature and animals.

Thus, the estimates for the posterior conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are educated guesses based on the personality sketch and not exact calculations.
