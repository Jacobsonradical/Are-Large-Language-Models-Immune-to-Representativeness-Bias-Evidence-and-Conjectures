To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), or the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (H) given the personality sketch (E), we use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \): Marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \)

Without specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can reason qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in the fields of computer science and business administration.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits someone in computer science is relatively high because:
     - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are common traits.
     - Solving puzzles and a curiosity about nature align with analytical and problem-solving skills typical in this field.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science is reasonably high given the popularity of the field among students with similar traits.
  
2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality fits someone in business administration is lower because:
     - Business students often require strong social skills and a focus on people and management, traits less emphasized in Adam's description.
     - While empathy and an understanding of hard work could fit, attributes such as a love for puzzles and abstract concepts are less directly relevant.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability could be lower compared to computer science because Adam's traits align more with empirical and analytical fields.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability that Adam is in computer science over business administration based on the alignment of his personality traits with common characteristics in those fields.
