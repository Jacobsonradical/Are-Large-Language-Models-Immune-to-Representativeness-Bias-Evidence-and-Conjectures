To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the challenge: we don't have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \), nor do we have the exact likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, we can make some qualitative assessments based on the given sketch of Adam's personality.

Let's define the variables:
- \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is a business administration student.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality given he is a computer science student.

Because we lack specific numerical priors and likelihoods, let's consider qualitative factors:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Personality traits such as empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work could make sense for someone in business administration. However, a deep curiosity about nature and animals might not be a strong indicator for this field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Moderate.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Generally, business administration is a popular graduate degree.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence, enjoyment of puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts, and curiosity align well with common traits in computer science students.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): High.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Computer science is also a popular graduate field with increasing enrollment.

Given these considerations, while not exact, we can estimate that the probability that Adam is in computer science might be higher given his personality traits.

To provide some numerical estimates, let's assume:
- Prior probability for business administration and computer science might be roughly similar (let's assume 0.2 for illustration purposes).
- Likelihood for business administration: \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.4 \)
- Likelihood for computer science: \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.8 \)

We simplify the conditional probability estimates as follows:
- Business Administration \( P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \): \( \approx 0.4 \times 0.2 / P(E) \)
- Computer Science \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \): \( \approx 0.8 \times 0.2 / P(E) \)

The ratio of these probabilities is \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) / P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = 0.8 / 0.4 = 2 \).

To normalize, the posterior for business administration should be about half that of computer science:

{
  "business administration": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}
