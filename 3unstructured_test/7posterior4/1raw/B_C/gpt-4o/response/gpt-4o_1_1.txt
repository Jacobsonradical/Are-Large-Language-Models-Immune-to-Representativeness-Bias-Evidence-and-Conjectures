Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), to compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field (computer science and business administration) and their base rates.

1. **P(E|H) - Likelihood of Evidence given Hypothesis:**
   - For **computer science**, Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles might suggest a high likelihood. Let's denote this as \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.8 \).
   - For **business administration**, traits like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable, but the fit might be less direct compared to computer science. Let's denote this as \( P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.4 \).

2. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - For **computer science**, given it is a common and growing field, we might say \( P(H_{cs}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - For **business administration**, also a common field, \( P(H_{ba}) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming similar base rates).

3. **P(E) - Marginal Likelihood of Evidence:**
   - This is challenging to estimate without specific data. Let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for normalization purposes.

Now, we calculate:

1. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.16 / P(E) \]

2. **Business Administration:**

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.08 / P(E) \]

We disregard normalization (P(E)) as desired.

The approximate posterior probabilities are:

  "computer science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.08
