To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field (business administration and computer science), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the probability of the evidence.

Given the information provided, we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge of the fields.

**Business Administration:**
Given Adam's personality traits (genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, warm heart, empathy, deep love for animals), it seems less likely that he would be in a field like business administration, which typically doesn't align as closely with these traits. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) might be relatively low.

**Computer Science:**
Computer science aligns well with Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts. It is also a field where animals and nature-related computational studies (like bioinformatics, environmental modeling) may be pursued, aligning more closely with his interests. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) might be relatively high.

Given these qualitative assessments:

1. **P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})**: Low
2. **P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})**: High

Assuming prior probabilities \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) are roughly equal, the posterior probabilities will be more influenced by the likelihoods.

Thus, we might qualitatively estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These are qualitative estimates and should not be taken as precise numerical values since actual computation would require more specific data.
