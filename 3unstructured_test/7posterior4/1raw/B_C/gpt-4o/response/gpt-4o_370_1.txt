To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis, the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the overall probability \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{ba} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{cs} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

### Approach
1. **Estimate Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - Prior probabilities can vary, but for simplicity, assume there's an equal chance for any given field among the numerous graduate fields possible.
   - Let's assume a wide range of graduate fields, so each field might initially have a low prior. 

2. **Estimate Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - **Business Administration:** Given Adam’s characteristics, especially his interest in nature and animals, and his quiet, empathetic demeanor, it seems less likely he would choose a high-energy, people-centric field like business administration.
     - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) might be low.
   - **Computer Science:** Given Adam’s love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, computer science seems more likely.
     - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) would be higher than business administration.

3. **Posterior Calculation:**
   - Compute \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and then use normalization if needed.

### Computation:

For simplicity, let’s assume:
- \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{other}) = 0.90 \)

Now, estimating \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.01 \) (low likelihood of Adam having chosen business administration)
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.3 \) (higher likelihood due to Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking)

Then, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{other}) \cdot P(H_{other}) \]
Given that we don't have a precise \( P(E|H_{other}) \), assume an arbitrary small value due to the prior summary's hint at other fields not perfectly aligning with Adam's personality traits.

With these assumptions:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.01 \cdot 0.05) + (0.3 \cdot 0.05) + \text{small value for other} \approx 0.01 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.05}{0.01} \approx 0.005 \] (this adjusts the previously low estimate for simplicity)
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.01} \approx 1.5 \]

Since the sum of probabilities needs readjustment:
We normalize,

\[ \text{Total Sum} = 1 \]

\[
P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.015 + \text{small}} = \frac{0.005}{0.02} \approx 0.25
\]
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.75}{0.005 + 0.015 + \text{small}} \approx 0.75
\]

### Final Answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
