To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, because we don't have specific numerical values for priors or likelihoods, we can only qualitatively evaluate them based on the provided information.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can reason about the fields as follows:

### Computer Science

**P(E|H)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits are highly relevant for computer science.

**P(H)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate studies in the U.S., so a reasonable prior probability exists.

### Business Administration

**P(E|H)**: While strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit business administration, his strong inclination towards nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles doesn't directly align with typical business administration characteristics.

**P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field for graduate studies in the U.S.

Taking these qualitative assessments, we can make an informed guess about the relative probabilities.

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

While these values are not precise, they reflect the qualitative likelihood given Adam's personality traits and their alignment with the typical demands and characteristics of the fields. Consequently, it appears more probable that Adam was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration based on his personality sketch.
