To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in each field. 

Bayes' Rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Let's make an educated estimation:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, but does it fit Adam's interests and personality? Perhaps not strongly.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, because business administration is generally more associated with interests in management, finance, etc., rather than nature, animals, and abstract concepts.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a very popular field, so statistically, it is quite likely.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, because computing often involves solving puzzles and dealing with abstract concepts, which aligns well with Adam's interests.

Given these considerations, the rough estimations are:

\[
P(H = \text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H = \text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]

For normalization, since we won't compute \( P(E) \), we directly compare the likelihood and prior of each field.

Given:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \) (Assuming a lower likelihood due to Adam's traits)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \) (Assuming it's low, around 0.2)
  
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \) (Assuming higher likelihood due to popularity)
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.7 \) (Assuming it fits Adam's traits well)

Then,

\[
P(H = \text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{\text{normalization factor}} = \frac{0.04}{\text{normalization factor}}
\]

\[
P(H = \text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.3}{\text{normalization factor}} = \frac{0.21}{\text{normalization factor}}
\]

In a simplified comparison, \( P(H = \text{computer science}|E) \) is much higher than \( P(H = \text{business administration}|E) \).

Therefore, the approximate values might be:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.1,  \quad \text{(Low due to both prior and conditional likelihood)}
  "computer science": 0.5  \quad \text{(Higher due to better fit and commonality)}
\}
\]

Assuming these values are normalized appropriately within the context of other possible fields.
