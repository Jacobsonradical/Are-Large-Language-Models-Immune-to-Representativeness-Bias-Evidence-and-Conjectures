To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to incorporate both the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of the hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam (\(E\)), we need to estimate:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence (often difficult to compute exactly but can be considered as a normalizing constant).

Since we do not have specific quantitative data, we must rely on qualitative reasoning and common patterns in these fields of study.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})\):
     - Business administration students might have a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, but they might be less likely to have a deep love for animals, a quiet nature, high empathy, and an interest in nature and puzzles.
     - Therefore, the likelihood is relatively low.

   - Prior \(P(H_{\text{business administration}})\):
     - Business administration is a relatively common graduate field, so the prior might be moderate.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\):
     - Computer science students often have high intelligence and are good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, which fits well with Adam's profile.
     - While not all computer science students have a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, this doesn't strongly detract from the likelihood.
     - Therefore, the likelihood is relatively high.

   - Prior \(P(H_{\text{computer science}})\):
     - Computer science is a very common graduate field, so the prior might be high.

With these qualitative assessments, we can make the following estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are not exact but are meant to approximate the relative probabilities based on the qualitative fit of the evidence to the typical profiles of these fields.
