To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' rule. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for the priors \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in each field) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of having Adam's personality sketch given the field), as well as the marginal \( P(E) \) (the probability of the personality sketch regardless of the field), we can provide qualitative assessments rather than precise numerical probabilities.

Let's evaluate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively based on Adam's traits:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Curiosity about abstract concepts.
   - High intelligence.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Empathy and warm heart (potentially useful for leadership).

While Adamâ€™s traits fit the possibility for either field, they align more specifically with computer science given the emphasis on abstract thinking, puzzles, and high intelligence. Business administration is somewhat less likely due to the absence of typical traits like leadership and strategic interest, although empathy and an appreciation for hard work do provide some relevance.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are rough estimates reflecting that Adam's traits are more aligned with computer science but still somewhat applicable to business administration.
