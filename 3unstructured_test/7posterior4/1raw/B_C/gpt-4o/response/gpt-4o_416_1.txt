To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to determine:

- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., that Adam is enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which is a normalizing constant derived from the sum of the likelihood of \( E \) given all possible hypotheses. 

Since exact values for these probabilities are not provided, we will use a qualitative approach to estimate them based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**

   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood that Adam possesses the given traits if he is enrolled in business administration. His traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals seem less directly related to business administration. However, strong intelligence and understanding of hard work can be somewhat relevant.
   - He has warm-heartedness and empathy, which might not be the primary focus in business administration but can still be valuable.

2. **Computer Science**

   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood that Adam possesses the given traits if he is enrolled in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are very relevant to computer science. Abstract thought is also a significant part of computer science.
   - His curiosity about nature and empathy might not be directly related to computer science but can still be coherent in interdisciplinary applications.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can make an estimate of the posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.2, 
  "computer science": 0.7
}

The difference in values reflects the higher relevance of Adam's traits to computer science over business administration.
