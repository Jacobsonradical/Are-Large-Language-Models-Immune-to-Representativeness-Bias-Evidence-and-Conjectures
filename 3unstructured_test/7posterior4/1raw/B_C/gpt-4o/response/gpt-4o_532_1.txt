To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, it's essential to understand that Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because you have not provided the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), assuming the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) will be subjective based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with the fields of study. Therefore, we must rely on a qualitative assessment.

Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the key points to consider are his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, strong empathy, and warm heart. Here are my assessments:

1. **Business Administration**: Typically, students in this field are interested in leadership, economics, finance, and management. While empathy and understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial in business, Adam's other traits such as strong curiosity about nature and love for animals do not strongly align with this field.

2. **Computer Science**: This field typically attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and possess high intelligence. Adam's quiet demeanor, intelligence, and enjoyment of solving puzzles would fit into this field well.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can make an educated guess about the posterior probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "computer science": 0.70
}
```

The given probabilities are subjective and based on the sketch provided. In a real-world scenario, these probabilities would ideally be quantified with more concrete data.
