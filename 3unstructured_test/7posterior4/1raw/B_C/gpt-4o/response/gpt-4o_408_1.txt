To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probability of Adam being in each field (business administration or computer science) and the likelihood of his personality traits given each field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability (which is constant across both hypotheses for comparison purposes)

Assumptions:
1. Since we don't have specific data, let's assume an equal prior probability for any given field of study without any specific information about Adam’s academic interests. In other words, \( P(H) \) for both business administration and computer science is 0.5.
2. The likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \), depend on how well Adam's personality traits match those typically associated with students in those fields.

Considering Adam’s personality traits (nature curiosity, love for animals, puzzles, high intelligence, empathy):

- **Business Administration:** While some traits (high intelligence, appreciation for hard work) can fit, others (curiosity about nature, love for animals, enjoying puzzles) are less common. Graduate students in business administration are less likely to be characterized predominantly by these traits.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{Business}}) \) - Let's assign this a relatively lower probability, say 0.1.

- **Computer Science:** Traits such as enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are typically strong indicators for a field like computer science. The empathy and love for animals might be less indicative but do not contradict the field either.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) - This probability should be higher; let's say 0.4.

Now we can compute:
1. Denominator \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, but we don't need its exact value for comparison purposes.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{Business Admin}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Business Admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Admin}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common factor and we’re interested in relative values:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.2
}

These values suggest that, given his personality traits, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration.
