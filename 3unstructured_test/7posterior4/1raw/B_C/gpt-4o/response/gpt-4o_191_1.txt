To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some initial assumptions about the probabilities involved. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Because we're working with specific fields (business administration and computer science), we'll denote them as \( H_{BA} \) and \( H_{CS} \), respectively. For simplicity, I'll assume some reasonable prior probabilities and likelihoods, given the information provided in the personality sketch.

Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \): Let's assume that 10% of graduate students are in business administration.
    - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.15 \): Let's assume that 15% of graduate students are in computer science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on the personality sketch provided.
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.05 \): The traits described (e.g., quiet, curiosity about nature, strong empathy) are less common among business administration students.
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \): Traits like high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are more aligned with computer science students.

To find \( P(E) \), we sum over all possible hypotheses:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + \text{(contributions from other fields)} \]
Since we don't have information about other fields, we'll focus on the relative comparison:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \cdot 0.15 \approx 0.005 + 0.045 = 0.05 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

1. For business administration (\( H_{BA} \)):
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = 0.1 \]

2. For computer science (\( H_{CS} \)):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.05} = 0.9 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
```

Please note that these values are based on the assumptions provided and the simplicity of the model used. In a more detailed analysis, additional fields and more accurate priors and likelihoods would be necessary.
