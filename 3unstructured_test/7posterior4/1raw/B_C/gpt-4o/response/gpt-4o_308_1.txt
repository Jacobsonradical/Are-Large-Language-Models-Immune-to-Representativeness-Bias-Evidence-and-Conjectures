To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the necessary priors \( P(H) \) (the prior probabilities of choosing each field) and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the given evidence). We can only make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration (H = Business Administration):**
   - Traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence could be relevant in business administration.
   - Traits like genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and solving puzzles are less stereotypically associated with business administration.

2. **Computer Science (H = Computer Science):**
   - Traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles align well with computer science.
   - Traits like genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals are less specifically related but do not contradict a computer science profile.

Given these qualitative assessments, we might estimate the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H=\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.3 \) (lower due to less alignment with some traits).
- \( P(E|H=\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.7 \) (higher due to strong alignment with many traits).

Now, we need standardized priors \( P(H) \). Let's assume the prior probability of a student being in either field is equal:

\[ P(H=\text{Business Administration}) = P(H=\text{Computer Science}) = 0.5 \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) will act as a normalizing constant across different hypotheses.

Although we can't calculate exact numerical values due to the lack of specific data, we can suggest that the conditional likelihoods and uniform priors inform our final posterior probabilities to a relative degree.

So, the estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These estimates suggest that Adam is significantly more likely to be a computer science student than a business administration student, given the personality sketch provided.
