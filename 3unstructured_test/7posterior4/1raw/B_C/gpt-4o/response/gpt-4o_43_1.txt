To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for Adam's personality sketch given the field, we will have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrollment in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.

Given the personality sketch:

1. Curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet, puzzle-solving nature.
3. Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  
We can deduce the following likelihoods:

- **Computer Science:** Fields like computer science often value intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, but less emphasis is often placed on empathy, love for animals, and nature. So \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.
  
- **Business Administration:** Generally, this field values interpersonal skills and empathy to an extent. However, the strong inclination towards animals and plants is less relevant, so \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is probably lower than that for computer science but not negligible.

Without specific prior probabilities, let's assume:

- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E) \) is constant, and cancels out in the comparative analysis.

We'll base our estimates on how well the personality traits align with each field using qualitative judgment:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)

Given the qualitative analysis, we use Bayes' Rule for both fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these values is not necessary for comparative purposes, but it is usually done to create a probability distribution:

{
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "business administration": "0.06"
}
