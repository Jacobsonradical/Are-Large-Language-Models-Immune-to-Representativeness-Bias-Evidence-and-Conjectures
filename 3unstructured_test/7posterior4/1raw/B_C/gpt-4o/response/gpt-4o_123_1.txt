To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we start with Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given the nature of the information, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and prior probabilities.

### Assumptions:
1. For business administration:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The traits mentioned are somewhat less aligned with business administration as a field does not typically focus on nature, plants, or animals but rather on management, finance, and organizational skills. However, high intelligence and appreciation for hard work can still be relevant.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Graduate programs in business administration are fairly common.

2. For computer science:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): The traits described, including high intelligence, love for puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, align well with fields like computer science. Curiosity and empathy, while not directly related, do not rule it out.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Computer science is also a common and competitive field.

### Likelihood and Prior Estimations:
The exact calculation would require precise data, but we'll make rational estimations:

- Letâ€™s assume:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \)

- Suppose the priors are:
  - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)

### Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):
This can be computed as the sum over all hypotheses:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + \ldots \]

For simplicity, we can consider the provided fields for this computation:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.21 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.23 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

- For business administration:
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.087 \]

- For computer science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.23} \]
  \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx 0.913 \]

So, accordingly:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.087,
  "computer science": 0.913
}
```
