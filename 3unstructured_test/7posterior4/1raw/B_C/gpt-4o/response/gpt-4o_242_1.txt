To apply Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\), we need the following components:

1. Prior probability, \(P(H)\): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without any additional information.
2. Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. Evidence, \(P(E)\): The total probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for the priors, likelihoods, and evidence, we'll make educated guesses based on general assumptions and the personality sketch provided.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **As a prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume the proportion of graduate students in business administration is moderate, say 0.2.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam’s personality, it seems less likely that he is in business administration, as his traits do not heavily align with the typically assertive and people-oriented nature often associated with this field. Let’s assign a likelihood of 0.2.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **As a prior \(P(H)\)**: Suppose the proportion of graduate students in computer science is also moderate, say 0.2.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam’s personality sketch, his interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Thus, we'll assign a higher likelihood, say 0.7.

Using these assumptions, we proceed without calculating the evidence explicitly, knowing it will be the same for both fields (as we are looking comparatively):

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Now, representing these in the required format:

{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.14
}

These values are proportional to the posterior beliefs given the personality sketch, showing that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in computer science compared to business administration based on the provided information.
