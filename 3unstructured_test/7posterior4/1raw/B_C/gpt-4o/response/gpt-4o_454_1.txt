To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the following values:

1. The prior probability \(P(H)\) for each field, which is the general proportion of graduate students in each field.
2. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\), which is the probability of observing the personality characteristics given the individual is in that field.
3. The marginal probability \(P(E)\), which is the overall likelihood of observing the personality characteristics across all fields.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for the distributions, I'll need to make educated assumptions based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science**: The field often attracts individuals with high intelligence, appreciation for solving puzzles, and sometimes an interest in abstract concepts. However, an inherent curiosity about nature/plants and strong empathy may not be as strongly aligned.
   - Prior \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\): Approximate proportion of grad students in computer science, let's assume 0.20 (20%).
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): Given the blend of personality traits, I'd estimate this at around 0.40.

2. **Business Administration**: This field attracts individuals interested in leadership, management, and strategy. The personality traits described do not seem to closely align, except perhaps for the strong empathy.
   - Prior \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\): Approximate proportion of grad students in business administration, let's assume 0.15 (15%).
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): The match is relatively weak, so I'll estimate this at around 0.10.

The marginal probability \(P(E)\) is difficult to calculate without knowing the distribution of personality traits across all fields, but we'll assume it's factored evenly across many disciplines.

### Calculations:
Using approximate values and our assumptions:
1. \(P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)}\)
2. \(P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}\)

We will normalize these to make sure our estimates fall between 0 and 1.

**Step 1: Calculate numerator values**
- For Computer Science: \(0.40 \cdot 0.20 = 0.08\)
- For Business Administration: \(0.10 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015\)

**Step 2: Determine intermediate max value for normalization**
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.015 = 0.095 \]

**Step 3: Compute the normalized probabilities**

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.095} = 0.842 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.095} = 0.158 \]

### Answer in required format:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.842,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
```

These values are approximate and are based on the assumed prior and likelihood values due to the lack of precise data.
