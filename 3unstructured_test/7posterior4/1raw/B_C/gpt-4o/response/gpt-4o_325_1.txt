To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch (E) of Adam using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in field H given the personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in field H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch E.

However, without specific empirical data for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we need to provide estimates based on logical reasoning and available information about typical personality traits for these fields.

### Reasoning:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - Personality traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not typically associated with business administration.
   - Skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could be less indicative of this field compared to computer science.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is likely low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for problem-solving and abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - High intelligence and quiet demeanor might fit well with the solitary and analytical nature of computer science.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is likely high.

Given these considerations, let's assign some plausible probabilities:
- Letâ€™s assume a prior \( P(H_{BA}) \) is 0.1 and \( P(H_{CS}) \) is 0.2 (reflecting the higher likelihood of technical and analytical fields being chosen by someone with the observed traits).
- Assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) as 0.05 and \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as 0.6.
- \( P(E) \) can be approximated as a weighted sum considering many fields, but here we will use the relative likelihoods above.

For simplification, normalize: \[
P(H|E)_{BA} \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005
\]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12
\]

To find the normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.005}{0.005 + 0.12} \approx  0.040
\]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.005 + 0.12} \approx 0.96
\]

Hence, the probabilities are:
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.040,
  "computer science": 0.96
}
\]

These normalized values reflect our best estimates given the qualitative reasoning based on Adam's traits.
