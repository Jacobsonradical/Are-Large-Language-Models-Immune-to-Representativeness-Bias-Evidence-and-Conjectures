To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence itself \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have actual data to determine the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the exact likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can make reasoned assumptions based on the personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science**: High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts point towards a good fit for computer science. However, the personality traits of empathy, love for animals, and enjoyment of nature are not specifically related to this field.
2. **Business Administration**: Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit business administration. However, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles isn't specifically indicative of business administration.

Given these insights, we can reason that the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is somewhat higher than \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \).

### Estimated Values:
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): This is the prior probability that Adam is a computer science student. Let's assume this is a commonly chosen field in graduate studies, so we give it a moderate prior.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): This is the prior probability for business administration, also a commonly chosen field, but his traits don't align as strongly with business traits.

For simplicity, if we assume the prior probabilities for both hypotheses are roughly equal, the main factors will be the likelihoods.

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

Given our qualitative observations, let's assign some values (keeping them between 0 and 1):

- For **computer science**, due to the alignment with abstract concepts and intelligence, we give it a higher posterior probability, say 0.6.
- For **business administration**, given the less direct alignment with his personality traits, we give it a lower posterior probability, say 0.2.

Our final answers, keeping them reasonable and qualitative, would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are estimates based on the interpretation of the personality traits and their alignment with the fields of study. Real posterior probabilities would require precise data and priors.
