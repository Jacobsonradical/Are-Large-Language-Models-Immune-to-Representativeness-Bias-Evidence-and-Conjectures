To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, i.e., the probability that any randomly selected graduate student would be enrolled in that field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, for each field.

Since these priors and specific likelihoods are not provided, it is challenging to compute exact values. However, we can make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided (E) and general knowledge.

Given Adam's interests and traits, we can make qualitative assessments about which field he might fit into better, and as a result, we can provide a sensible estimate rather than an exact probability.

Let's consider the following:

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are strong fits for computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with the logic and problem-solving aspects of computer science.
  
### Business Administration
- A quiet boy with a warm heart and strong empathy may not align as closely with the typical traits required for business administration, which often emphasizes leadership, networking, and interpersonal skills.
- However, a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication do align well with business administration.

Based on the traits and interests, computer science seems to be a more likely match than business administration.

Next, let's assign subjective probabilities to these hypotheses:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

Please note that these values are purely qualitative estimates, considering the personality sketch provided and how those traits align with the general expectations of each field.
