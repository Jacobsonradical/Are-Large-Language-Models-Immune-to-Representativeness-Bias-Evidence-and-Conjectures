To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis given Adam's personality sketch, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of observing evidence \(E\).

Since we are not given explicit values for \(P(H)\) (the prior probabilities), \(P(E|H)\) (likelihoods), and \(P(E)\) (the marginal probability), I will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam to determine the likelihoods.

Given the traits provided in the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We'll provide a qualitative estimate rather than exact numerical values, as exact values are not provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Business Administration**: Typically involves a strong interest in leadership, management, finance, organizational behavior, and less direct engagement with nature, puzzles, and animals. It's generally more people-focused and less abstract.
2. **Computer Science**: Involves significant problem solving, dealing with abstract concepts, and often a high level of intelligence. Computer science can also involve algorithms, puzzles, and logical thinking, which align with Adam's interests and strengths.

### Likelihood Estimation:

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits are less aligned with the typical characteristics expected of someone in Business Administration.
  - Estimated \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\): Low (between 0 and 0.3).

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s traits align well with those expected of a Computer Science student.
  - Estimated \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\): High (between 0.6 and 0.9).

### Prior Probabilities:
- Assuming that the prior probabilities for being in these fields are equal (though they're not provided): \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = P(H_{\text{CS}}) \).

Given these assumptions, we get the following qualitative distributions:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** Since the traits provided in the personality sketch (interest in nature and animals, puzzle-solving, abstract concepts) align poorly with this field, the posterior probability is low.
- **Computer Science:** The traits match well with curiosity, problem-solving, and high intelligence characteristic of Computer Science, so the posterior probability is high.

Please note these values are estimated based on qualitative alignment since exact probabilities were not provided.
