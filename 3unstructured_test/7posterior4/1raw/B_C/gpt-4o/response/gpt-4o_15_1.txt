First, let's recall Bayes' Rule, which is used to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

While we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is a computer science student. Given that computer science is a common field, this might be moderately high.
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is a computer science student. Adam's traits like high intelligence and liking for puzzles align well with typical computer science students.
- **P(E):** The overall probability of observing students like Adam in the entire student population.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
- **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is a business administration student. This could vary but is generally lower than fields directly linked with "solving puzzles" and "abstract concepts".
- **P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's traits given that he is a business administration student. Business students might not necessarily show the same focus on puzzles or abstract thinking to the same extent.
- **P(E):** Again, the overall probability of observing students like Adam in the student population.

In a real scenario, we'd need precise statistical data to get exact numbers. Due to the lack of exact data, we'll make an educated guess based on the traits described.

**Posterior Probability Estimations:**

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These estimations reflect that based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science than in business administration. The numbers are illustrative and would benefit from concrete data for precision.
