To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to start with Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant (the same for all fields) and we are comparing between business administration and computer science, we can disregard \( P(E) \) for relative comparison. Thus, we need:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assumptions and estimates:
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field. 
    - Business Administration: Relatively common field, moderate prior probability.
    - Computer Science: Also common and given Adam's background in abstract thinking, might have a similar or higher prior probability.

2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in each specific field.
    - Business Administration: Moderate fit (empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work, but not a perfect fit for curiosity about nature and high intelligence in abstract concepts).
    - Computer Science: Higher fit (interest in puzzles, abstract thinking, high intelligence, etc., but might be slightly less aligned with empathy/warm heart compared to nature-related fields).

Hereâ€™s the posterior probability I'll assign, given these considerations:

{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

This indicates that based on Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he was enrolled in computer science than business administration, but there is still some probability he may have been in business administration.
