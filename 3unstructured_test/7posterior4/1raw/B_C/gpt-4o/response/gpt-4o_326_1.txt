Sure, let's start by breaking down the application of Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, let's assume we lack detailed statistical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods. Therefore, we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

### Computer Science
**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**  
Given the high number of students in computer science programs, we can assume \( P(H) \) is moderately high.

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**  
Adam's traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving align well with computer science. While these traits could apply to many fields, we'll assign a moderate to high likelihood.

### Business Administration
**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**  
Business administration also has a significant number of graduate students, but we might give it a slightly lower prior probability compared to computer science.

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**  
Adam's traits such as empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm-hearted nature align well with business administration, particularly with fields involving management or human resources. However, the lack of direct interest in business per se is a slight offset.

Taking all these qualitative assessments into account, we assign subjective probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are approximations and should ideally be refined with more specific data.
