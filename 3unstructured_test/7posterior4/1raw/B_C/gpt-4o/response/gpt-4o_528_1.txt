To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field (\(P(H)\)) and the probability of observing the given evidence (\(E\)) given each hypothesis (\(P(E|H)\)). However, without explicit data on these probabilities, we will need to make some educated guesses based on the given personality sketch. These will be rough estimates:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - The sketch mentions Adam's high intelligence, interest in puzzles (which relates to problem-solving skills), and good understanding of abstract concepts. These attributes are often associated with computer science students.
   - Prior probability might be moderate, as computer science is a common field for intelligent students.
   - Likelihood of observing such traits in a computer science student is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - The sketch emphasizes Adam's quiet nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals. While empathy can be a good trait in business, the quiet nature and love for animals don’t strongly align with typical business administration traits.
   - Prior probability might be lower than computer science, as the field’s typical personality profile doesn’t align as well with Adam's.
   - Likelihood of observing such traits in a business administration student is relatively lower compared to computer science.

Based on these considerations, we can make rough estimates of the posterior probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative assessment of the fit between Adam's personality and the typical characteristics of students in these fields. They do not sum to 1 because we have not considered other potential fields of specialization that also might match Adam’s profile.
