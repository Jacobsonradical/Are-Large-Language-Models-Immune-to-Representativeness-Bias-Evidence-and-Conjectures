To use Bayes' rule to compute P(H|E), we need to know the prior probabilities P(H) for each hypothesis, the probability of the evidence given each hypothesis P(E|H), and the probability of the evidence P(E). Since we don’t have exact numerical values for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the information provided.

1. **Prior Probability P(H):** This is the base rate or initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field before considering his personality.

2. **Likelihood P(E|H):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Probability of Evidence P(E):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch irrespective of the field he is enrolled in.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we will qualitatively assess how well Adam’s personality traits match with each field.

- **Business Administration:**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance to business administration.
  - Solving puzzles: High relevance in strategic decision-making but not a defining trait.
  - Warm heart and empathy: Moderate relevance, particularly in leadership roles in business.
  - Deep love for animals: Low relevance.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Relevant.
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Relevant.

- **Computer Science:**
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Neutral or slight relevance (interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics).
  - Solving puzzles: High relevance, as problem-solving is a key aspect of computer science.
  - Warm heart and empathy: Low to moderate relevance, though it can be important in team dynamics.
  - Deep love for animals: Low relevance.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant.
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Very relevant.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the personality traits of Adam align more strongly with computer science than business administration.

Now to provide a rough estimate using the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Please note that these values are meant to reflect the relative strengths of alignment based on traits provided and should be validated with actual data for more precision.
