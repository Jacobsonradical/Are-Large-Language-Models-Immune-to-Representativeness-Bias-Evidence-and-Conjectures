To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability of Adam enrolling in each field without considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields of graduate study.

Since we lack specific data on the prior probabilities and the exact likelihoods, we'll have to use reasonable assumptions based on the information contained in the personality sketch.

**Assumptions:**

- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field will be assumed to be fairly equal due to no additional information.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) will be estimated based on how well the described personality sketch fits a typical student in each field.

### Estimations:

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \) (assuming Adam has a 25% chance among four hypothetical fields)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - Business administration students might value empathy and appreciation for hard work but may not typically be known for a strong curiosity in nature or solving puzzles.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood)

#### Computer Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \) (assuming equal prior)
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - Computer science students often require high intelligence, enjoy puzzles, and understand abstract concepts.
  - The affinity for nature and animals may not be as directly related but does not contradict the field.
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate likelihood)

### Calculations:
To find the posterior probability, we can ignore \( P(E) \) because it is a common scaling factor across different hypotheses, so we only need to compare the numerators.

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \times 0.25 = 0.075 \]

### Relative Probabilities:
- Business Administration: \( 0.025 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.075 \)

Given these normalized comparisons, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.25",
  "computer science": "0.75"
}
```

These are relative probabilities indicating that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is three times more likely he is enrolled in computer science than business administration.
