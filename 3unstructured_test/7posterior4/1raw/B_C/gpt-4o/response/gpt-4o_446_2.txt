To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch in general.

Given the limited context and without exact prior probabilities for Adam being in each field, we can make educated guesses based on common knowledge and the typical traits associated with students in those fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally attracts individuals who have interest in management, leadership, and organizational skills.
   - Adam’s traits (e.g., strong empathy, quiet nature, and love for nature and animals) do not strongly align with the stereotypical traits of business administration students.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be relatively low.
   - Assuming \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) to be moderate as business administration is a common field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Typically attracts those with high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and an interest in solving puzzles—traits that strongly align with Adam's personality.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is likely high.
   - Assuming \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) to be moderate as computer science is also a common field.

Given this, we can make qualitative assessments and provide approximate probabilities (keeping in mind it's more heuristic than precise without real data):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are provided based on the assumption that Adam's personality fits much more closely with the typical traits of a computer science student than a business administration student. However, these estimates should be refined with actual prior probabilities and a more detailed assessment of \( P(E|H) \) if available.
