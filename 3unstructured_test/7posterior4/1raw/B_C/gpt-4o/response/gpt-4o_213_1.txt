To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in a particular field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the specific field \( H \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the following prior probabilities:

- For computer science (\( P(H) \)), let's assume 0.30.
- For business administration (\( P(H) \)), let's assume 0.20.
- We won't worry about \( P(E) \) in this case as we are dealing with relative comparisons between two fields.

Next, we estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- For computer science, Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a relatively high likelihood. Given his empathy and love for animals, which are not strongly related to computer science, let's assume a moderate likelihood \( P(E|H) = 0.5 \).
  
- For business administration, Adam's warm heart and appreciation for hard work might fit, but his curiosity about nature, high intelligence in abstract concepts, and empathy seem less typical. We'd assign a lower likelihood \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' rule, we can calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \). Note that the denominator \( P(E) \) will cancel out because we're interested in relative comparison only:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.30 = 0.15
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.20 = 0.04
\]

Finally, normalizing these relative probabilities to ensure they are comparable:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.15}{0.19} \approx 0.789
\]

\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.15 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.19} \approx 0.211
\]

Thus, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.789,
  "business administration": 0.211
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the provided personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science rather than business administration in 2021.
