To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need some baseline probabilities (priors) for each field \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field of study \( P(E|H) \). Unfortunately, exact numerical values for these probabilities aren't provided.

However, using the qualitative information, we can make educated estimations:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the typical skills and interests of a computer science student. His quiet nature and empathy, while not directly aligned, are not necessarily against it either (considering interdisciplinary fields such as AI and human-computer interaction).

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals seems less related to business administration. Although empathy can be useful in business, his stronger inclination towards nature and abstract concepts might not align well with the typical interests of a business administration student.

Given these qualitative assessments, hereâ€™s a possible estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These values are speculative and based on subjective weighting of the personality traits. For a more accurate calculation, precise prior probabilities and likelihoods would be required.
