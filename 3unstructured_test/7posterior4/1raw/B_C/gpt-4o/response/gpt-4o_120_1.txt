To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will first need some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which indicates how likely we are to observe the personality sketch given each field of study. However, since specific numerical probabilities for these priors and likelihoods are not provided, we'll use qualitative reasoning to give approximate probabilities.

Given the personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

For "computer science" (CS):
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts strongly fit.
- Enjoying solving puzzles is also a strong indicator for someone in CS.
- Empathy and a love for animals do not directly correlate but are not exclusive.

For "business administration" (BA):
- Empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication are important traits in business.
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts also fit but are less central compared to CS.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly relevant to business administration.

Approximate posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These are rough estimates given the qualitative reasoning. In a real-world scenario, numerical prior probabilities and detailed likelihoods would provide more precise values.
