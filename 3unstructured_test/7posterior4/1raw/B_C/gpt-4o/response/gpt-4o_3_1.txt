To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we take into account the prior probability of each field (which can be a general estimation based on typical distributions of graduate students in the U.S.) and the likelihood that the personality traits described in \( E \) match a student in that field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (the field of study).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of \( E \), which normalizes the result but is not needed if we are comparing the relative probabilities.

Given only the personality sketch, let's assume some rough estimates of priors and likelihoods based on the traits described:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Priors: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.3 (assuming a considerable portion of graduate students might be in CS, given the high demand and popularity).
   - Likelihood: Given the high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts which are favorable for CS, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.6.

2. **Business Administration (MBA)**:
   - Priors: \( P(H_{\text{MBA}}) \) = 0.2 (assuming a significant but smaller portion of students compared to CS).
   - Likelihood: Given the traits described, which match less closely with typical business administration students who often emphasize leadership, teamwork, and communication, let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{MBA}}) \) = 0.3.

Thus, we have:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}
\]
And similarly for Business Administration. Relative probabilities can be compared without needing to know \( P(E) \). 

Now the calculations:

For CS:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18
\]

For MBA:
\[
P(H_{\text{MBA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06
\]

Normalizing (dividing each by the sum of both constants to simplify):

Sum of weights:
\[
0.18 + 0.06 = 0.24
\]

Normalized:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.24} \approx 0.75
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{MBA}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.24} \approx 0.25
\]

But since we are asked for values without needing them to add up to 1 (independent probabilities):

{
  "computer science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}
