To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or business administration, we'll need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete statistical data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in each field) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of having Adam's personality sketch given each field), we'll have to rely on reasonable assumptions. 

Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will qualitatively assess how well his traits align with each field.

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: strong alignment
- Enjoys solving puzzles: strong alignment
- Quiet and introspective: moderately aligns (many computer science students are introverted but this is not universally true)
- Empathy and love for animals: not a strong alignment but not contradictory
- Curiosity about nature: somewhat aligns (e.g., artificial intelligence in biology)

### Business Administration
- High intelligence: aligns well
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: aligns moderately (problem-solving is crucial but being quiet is less stereotypical)
- Empathy: aligns moderately (valuable in leadership roles but not a primary trait for the field)
- Warm heart and strong understanding of hard work: aligns moderately (characteristics beneficial in leadership roles)
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals: does not strongly align

Assuming equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields for simplicity, and based on the alignment of Adam's traits, we can thus infer:

- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is higher due to more of his traits matching.
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is lower due to fewer traits fitting the typical profile.

Let us assign \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.7 \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \) as illustrative likelihoods.

Given these qualitative assessments:
- If we assume equal priors \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.5 \), Bayesâ€™ rule simplifies to compare the likelihoods directly since \( P(E) \) remains constant. 

Hence, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) would be proportional to these likelihoods.

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.7
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx 0.3
\]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on reasonable qualitative assessments of how Adam's personality traits fit the fields, assuming equal priors for simplicity.
