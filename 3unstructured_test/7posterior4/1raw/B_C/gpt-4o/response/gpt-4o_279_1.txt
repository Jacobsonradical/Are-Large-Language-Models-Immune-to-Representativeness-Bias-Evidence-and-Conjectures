To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to start with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, we will make some assumptions about the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the description of Adam's personality and background.

### Assumptions

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   Suppose the prior probabilities of Adam being in each of the given fields are somewhat equal.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   Based on the personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihoods:
   - For **business administration**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is less likely, but not impossible, that he is in business administration. We might rate this likelihood lower.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)
   - For **computer science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles, it is more likely that he is in computer science.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \)

### Calculations

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

- For **business administration**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)}
  \]
  Since \( P(E) \) is common for both and we are comparing probabilities, it can be neglected:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15
  \]

- For **computer science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}
  \]
  Neglecting \( P(E) \):
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35
  \]

### Normalizing the probabilities
To get the final probabilities, we should sum the unnormalized probabilities and divide each by this sum:
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5
\]

- Normalized probability for **business administration**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3
  \]

- Normalized probability for **computer science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7
  \]

### Final result:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```
