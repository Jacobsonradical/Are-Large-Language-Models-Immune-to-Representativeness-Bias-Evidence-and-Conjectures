To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis (the probability of being enrolled in a particular field), as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis). Without concrete numerical values for these, we can only qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the provided description of Adam's personality and interests.

Given Adam's traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Quietness and enjoyment of puzzles
3. Warm heart and strong empathy
4. Love for animals
5. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can qualitatively assess the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \).

### Business Administration

- Curiosity about nature and plants may not directly align.
- Enjoyment of puzzles is somewhat relevant (problem-solving skills).
- Warm heart and empathy could be relevant for leadership and management.
- Love for animals is not particularly relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.

### Computer Science

- Curiosity about nature and plants may not directly align, but understanding complex systems might.
- Enjoyment of puzzles is highly relevant (algorithmic and problem-solving skills).
- Warm heart and empathy are less directly relevant.
- Love for animals is not particularly relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is highly relevant.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

- Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts strongly align with a field like computer science.
- While business administration might also align with some aspects of his personality (e.g., leadership skills, appreciation for hard work), it seems less tailored to his specific interests and strengths compared to computer science.

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities might be qualitatively estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This estimation reflects a stronger alignment of the personality traits with computer science over business administration, taking into account the lack of precise numerical priors and likelihoods.
