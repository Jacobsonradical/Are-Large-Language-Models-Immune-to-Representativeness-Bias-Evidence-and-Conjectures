To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account both the personality sketch \( E \) and any prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science. Since we do not have the explicit prior probabilities, let's make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the characteristics of these fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will need to estimate \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, without explicit data and for simplicity, we will focus primarily on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and use proportional reasoning.

1. **P(E|H for business administration)**:
   - Business administration often involves interest in management, leadership, and finance. The sketch describes Adam as having strong empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, but doesn't particularly highlight any traits specifically aligned with business administration.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business\_administration}) \) might be considered relatively low.

2. **P(E|H for computer science)**:
   - Computer science often requires high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, all of which are noted in Adam's personality sketch. Adam's curiosity and his quiet nature might also fit well with the typical environment of computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \) would be relatively high.

Given proportional estimates and the strong alignment of Adam's described traits with computer science, we would approximate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2, 
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimated to reflect the proportionally higher likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with computer science compared to business administration, based on the given sketch. 

Note: Without detailed prior probabilities or more domain-specific information, these are informed estimates rather than precise probabilities.
