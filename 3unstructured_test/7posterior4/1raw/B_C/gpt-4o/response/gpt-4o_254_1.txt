Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \) times the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to give precise numeric values for \( P(H|E) \), we would typically need information on:
1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the likelihood of Adam being in each field without considering his personality sketch).
2. The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of his personality traits given that he is in each field).
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) (the overall likelihood of observing his personality sketch).

Since exact numeric values for these probabilities are not provided, we have to rely on intuitive estimates. Given the personality sketch provided, we can make reasonable, qualitative computations based on how well Adam's personality traits align with each field of study.

### Estimation:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking align well with the skills needed in computer science.
   - His love for solving puzzles also fits well with common activities in this field.
   - His interest in nature might not be directly related but doesn't conflict either.

   Based on these alignments, we can hypothesize a moderate to high likelihood.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit well in business administration contexts.
   - His quiet nature and deep love for animals might not be as directly relevant to this field.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for solving puzzles are not typical traits strongly associated with business administration but also don't conflict too much.

   Overall, there might be a lower likelihood compared to computer science given the personality sketch.

### Qualitative Probabilities:
Consider P(H|E) on a scale of 0 to 1 based on the fit of the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These are qualitative estimates based on the information given. In a real scenario, exact prior probabilities and likelihoods would be needed for precise calculation.
