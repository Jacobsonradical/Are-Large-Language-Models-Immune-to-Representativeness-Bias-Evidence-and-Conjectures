To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following components:

- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for the observed evidence given each hypothesis.
- The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this problem, we do not have explicit values for these components. However, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Qualitative Assessments
#### Business Administration
- Common traits might include leadership, a strong focus on human interactions, interest in economic matters, and practical problem-solving skills.
- Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work could be partially relevant, but do not strongly align with typical Business Administration characteristics.

#### Computer Science
- Common traits might include problem-solving skills, intelligence, an understanding of abstract concepts, and sometimes a quiet or introverted nature.
- Adam's traits like high intelligence, problem-solving enjoyment, understanding of abstract concepts, and a quiet, introspective nature align well with the characteristics often found in Computer Science students.

### Posterior Probabilities
Given this qualitative assessment:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \) is likely higher than \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \) because Adam's personality sketch more closely aligns with typical Computer Science student traits than Business Administration traits.

Let's assign approximate qualitative probabilities (not precise, but based on the above reasoning):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These are subjective estimates and not precise calculations. To get precise values, we would need actual prior probabilities and likelihoods for each hypothesis.
