To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. However, since we don't have specific numerical values for priors or likelihoods, we'll make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch of Adam. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Due to the lack of numerical priors and likelihoods, we will qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) based on the fit of the field to Adam’s personality traits. 

- **Business Administration**: While it involves problem-solving, it typically doesn't directly involve nature, plants, abstract concept understanding, or a deep connection with animals. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) should be relatively low. 

- **Computer Science**: It involves high intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts, aligning well with many of Adam's traits. \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) should be comparatively higher.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Now let’s justify these values:
- **Business Administration**: Despite requiring problem-solving skills, it does not typically correlate strongly with a love for nature, plants, or animals, nor does it typically prioritize abstract conceptual understanding to the same degree as computer science. Therefore, we assign a low probability (0.1).

- **Computer Science**: This field aligns well with the traits described, including high intelligence, problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and perhaps dedication to tasks (which can also apply to academic endeavors in this field). Thus, we assign a higher probability (0.6). 

Note these values are illustrative and based on qualitative reasoning; actual prior probabilities and likelihoods would refine these estimates.
