To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in a particular field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is in that field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which can be seen as a normalizing constant across all hypotheses. 

For the sake of this problem, let's assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for different fields, as we are not given specific data about the distribution of graduate students across different fields.

Given Adam's described personality sketch \( E \), we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):
- **Computer Science:** Adam is described as highly intelligent, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, traits commonly associated with computer science students. Thus, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) should be relatively high.

- **Business Administration:** While empathy, a warm heart, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work can align with business administration, it is less closely related to the specific traits like enjoying solving puzzles and interest in nature. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) should be somewhat lower compared to computer science.

### Priors (\( P(H) \)):
We assume equal priors:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{number\ of\ considered\ fields} \]

Since we aren't normalizing (as there are other graduate fields), the important part is the relative likelihoods.

### Relative Computations:
Given that \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{BA}) \) are the same, the probabilities \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) and \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) will be primarily influenced by \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).

For illustrative purposes, let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

These values are chosen to reflect the qualitative reasoning that Adam's traits fit better with computer science than business administration.

### Results:
Now we compute the normalized posterior probabilities.

Substituting the values:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

Given the qualitative nature of these estimations and assuming equal prior probabilities, these values indicate that Adam is more likely pursuing computer science than business administration.
