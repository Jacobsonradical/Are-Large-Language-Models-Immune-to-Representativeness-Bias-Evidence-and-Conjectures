To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the personality sketch given the field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the personality sketch across all fields.

However, since we do not have specific numeric values for these components, we will conceptually reason through the likelihoods to estimate the posterior probabilities.

### Reasoning Through the Likelihoods

- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with traits typically associated with individuals in computer science. The field also often appreciates diligent and dedicated individuals.
  
- **Business Administration**: This field might also place a high value on intelligence and dedication. However, Adam's particular interests in nature, empathy, and love for animals seem less directly related to typical traits emphasized in business administration.

Given the personality sketch E, let's provide a rough estimate:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Without specific data, we assume priors are roughly equal since many fields could be open to Adam.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) is presumably higher than \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \) given Adam's traits.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - The sketch fits better with a field that values abstract thinking and problem-solving (like computer science).

Considering the reasoning above, we can estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This is a rough estimate based on reasoning rather than precise numeric calculation, reflecting that Adam's traits are more typical and aligned with computer science than with business administration.
