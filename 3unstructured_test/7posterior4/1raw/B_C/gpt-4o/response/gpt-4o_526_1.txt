To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \): prior probability of being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): likelihood of the personality traits given enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E) \): evidence, or the total probability of personality traits \( E \).

While we do not have specific numbers to accurately compute these probabilities, we can qualitatively infer these probabilities based on the given personality sketch and our understanding of computer science and business administration fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science, which involves complex problem-solving and abstract thinking.
   - His enjoyment in solving puzzles is a trait often found in computer science students.
   - However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals are not characteristics most distinctly associated with computer science, although not exclusive from it.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically values interpersonal skills and leadership, which may not strongly align with Adam’s description of being a quiet boy.
   - Adam's traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are not uniquely indicative of business administration.

Based on these qualitative insights, we can make an educated estimate about the likelihoods:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These numbers reflect a higher likelihood that Adam, given his personality sketch, would be in a field like computer science rather than business administration. However, these values are subjective estimates due to lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.
