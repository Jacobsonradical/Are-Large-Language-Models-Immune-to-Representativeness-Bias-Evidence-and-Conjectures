To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we'd need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). The posterior probability is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Given these limitations, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided. 

For example, the personality sketch of Adam shows he has strong interests and abilities that align well with fields that require problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a love for nature and animals. Here's a rough estimate based on these qualitative factors:

- **Computer Science:** 
  - Likely high because of his intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts.
  - \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \) should be relatively high given that Computer Science demands problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.
  - Prior belief in the high enrollment in CS disciplines can be strong too.

- **Business Administration:**
  - Less likely because the sketch does not emphasize skills or interests that highly correlate with business fields (i.e., management, finance, economics).
  - \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \) might be lower since the description matches less distinctly with typical Business Administration interests or requisite skills.

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, let's guess the relative values:

{
  "computer science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.20
}

Remember, these are estimates based on the qualitative match between Adam's profile and the typical demands of these fields. Ideally, having more detailed priors and likelihoods would yield more accurate probabilities.
