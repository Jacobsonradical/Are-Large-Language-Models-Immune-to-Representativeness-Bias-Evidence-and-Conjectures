To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of encountering the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given hypothesis \( H \) (enrollment in a particular field).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have exact numeric values for these probabilities, we need to use qualitative judgment based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields. The exact calculation of \( P(E) \) also requires the inclusion of more fields, but we can make relative comparisons.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \):
     - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are strong indicators for computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H_{cs}) \):
     - Generally, a significant percentage of graduate students enroll in computer science.
   - The combination of these factors suggests a moderately high posterior probability.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \):
     - Empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, but high intelligence and abstract thinking are less defining traits for business administration compared to fields like computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H_{ba}) \):
     - Business administration also has a significant number of graduate students, but possibly less overlap with Adam's specific traits.
   - This suggests a lower posterior probability than computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, typical likelihoods, and priors, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

Please note these values are rough estimates derived from qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculations due to lack of exact numeric data. The true values would require comprehensive statistical data on the priors and likelihoods.
