To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration and computer science based on the given personality sketch, we would typically need additional information such as prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being in those fields and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality traits in individuals from those fields. Since this specific data isn't provided, I will assume some basic values to illustrate the concept.

Let's make some judicious assumptions to proceed with these calculations:

1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - The probability that any given graduate student is in business administration: \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
   - The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science: \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
   These values are arbitrary but reasonable for illustration.

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration: \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) 
     Because Adamâ€™s traits do not strongly align with typical business administration skills.
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science: \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
     As Adam's characteristics like curiosity, problem-solving abilities, and intelligence align fairly well with traits often found in computer science. 

3. **Normalizing Factor** \( P(E) \):
   - To normalize, we would sum the probabilities of \( E \) across all considered fields, but since values for other fields aren't specified, we will treat the sum of computed likelihoods as our normalizer.

### Calculation using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Assume \( P(E) \) is summed for both fields in consideration.

### Posterior Probability Calculations:
1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})) + (P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11 \]

### Final Posterior Probabilities:
1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.11} = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.1818 \]
   
2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.11} = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.8182 \]

Here's the final result formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1818,
  "computer science": 0.8182
}
```

These values reflect the conditional probabilities based on given assumptions about the priors and likelihoods. In real-world scenarios, more comprehensive data would provide more precise values.
