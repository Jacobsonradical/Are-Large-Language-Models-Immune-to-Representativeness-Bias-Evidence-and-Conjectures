To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, in the absence of explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the exact numerical values for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate the probabilities.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, here are some considerations for the fields Computer Science and Business Administration:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Adam has a strong understanding of abstract concepts and high intelligence, which are beneficial traits for a field like Computer Science.
    - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving and analytical skills required in Computer Science.
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants might not directly suggest Computer Science but doesn't rule it out either.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - While business administration can also benefit from high intelligence and communication skills, the specific traits given (e.g., love for animals, strong empathy) do not strongly align with the stereotypical skills emphasized in a Business Administration program.
    - There is minimal direct evidence from the personality sketch that Adam has an interest in business-related activities or management studies.

Considering these points:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",  // Based on the alignment of problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking with CS.
  "business administration": "0.3"  // Based on weaker alignment with the typical traits for business studies.
}

These are estimated probabilities and are based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculation due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood values.
