To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \), as well as the prior probabilities of each field. Bayes’ rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide a qualitative assessment. Here's an analysis based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically attracts individuals with strong interests in leadership, management, finance, marketing, and often a less pronounced focus on nature or animals. Adam's personality does not strongly align with the typical interests or skills emphasized in business administration, such as strategic decision-making or profit maximization. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration might be somewhat lower.

2. **Computer Science**: This field usually attracts individuals who excel in problem-solving and abstract thinking. Given Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts, the alignment with computer science is quite strong. Additionally, empathy and a warm heart could contribute to areas in computer science like user experience, human-computer interaction, or ethical AI. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science would be relatively higher.

Given these considerations and without specific numerical values, here’s a reasonable qualitative guess at the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are illustrative and represent an informed guess based on the alignment of Adam’s personality traits with the typical skills and interests associated with each field.
