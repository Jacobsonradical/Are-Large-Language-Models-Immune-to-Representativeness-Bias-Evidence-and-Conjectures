To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, it's challenging to provide precise numerical values. However, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided and typical distributions of graduate fields in the U.S.

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, it's plausible that he could be enrolled in computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might not directly align with the stereotypical computer science profile, though they are not mutually exclusive.

- **Business Administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be a fit for business administration, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants seem less directly related to this field.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here are reasonable estimates for the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) \approx 0.3 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) \approx 0.1 \]

Thus, the answers are:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
