To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start by understanding Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \).

Without specific numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihood, we can rely on qualitative assessment. We'll assume reasonable assumptions based on the description provided:

### Assumptions:
- **Computer Science (H1)**:
  - Likelihood: High, as Adam demonstrates intelligence, problem-solving skills (puzzles), and an understanding of abstract concepts.
  - Prior: Moderate, as computer science is a common graduate field in the U.S.

- **Business Administration (H2)**:
  - Likelihood: Moderate, as Adam shows empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication which are relevant in business settings.
  - Prior: Moderate, as business administration is also a common graduate field in the U.S.

Without exact numbers, we can make a qualitative estimation.

### Estimation:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): High
   - \( P(H_1) \): Moderate
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Moderate
   - \( P(H_2) \): Moderate

Given this, qualitatively, we expect a higher posterior probability for computer science than business administration, but not by a magnitude of order.

### Posterior Probabilities (Estimate):
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This rough estimate suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely (but not certain) that he was enrolled in a field like computer science compared to business administration, but both remain plausible. For precise values, specific numerical priors and likelihoods would be necessary.
