To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis. However, since this information is not explicitly provided, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge and the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the constraints of this exercise, we will focus on estimating the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the provided sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are traits that align well with a field like Computer Science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles could align well with problem-solving in programming and algorithms.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy and understanding are important in Business Administration, especially in areas like human resources or management.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication can be relevant, but other traits like a curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less directly relevant.

Now, we qualitatively assess the likelihoods and combine them with assumed priors. Though I cannot provide precise priors, let’s assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity. Hence, the focus is primarily on \( P(E|H) \).

\[ P(E|CS) \approx 0.7 \] — Given the strong match with computer science characteristics.
\[ P(E|BA) \approx 0.3 \] — Given some lesser but relevant matching characteristics.

For this exercise, we can provide a qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are intuitive approximations based on the personality traits described for Adam and their alignment with the typical demands and nature of these fields. Please note that more precise values would require detailed data on prior distributions and likelihoods from empirical studies on student enrollment trends relative to personality profiles.
