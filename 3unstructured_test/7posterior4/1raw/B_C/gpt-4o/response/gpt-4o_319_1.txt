To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, with the limited information provided, we will make some reasoned assumptions to estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch E, let's evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

### Likelihood Estimation
1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strongly aligned with computer science.
   - Interest in solving puzzles also suggests an aptitude in computer science.
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants is less directly aligned but acceptable.
   
   Therefore, we can estimate \( P(E|H) \) for computer science to be relatively high, say 0.7.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - A warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work can be beneficial in business administration.
   - The deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less typically associated but could still be relevant.
   
   Therefore, the \( P(E|H) \) for business administration could be somewhat moderate, say 0.4.

### Prior Probabilities
Let's make some inferred prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for these fields:

- **Computer Science**: Assume the prior likelihood of being enrolled in computer science is moderate, say 0.2.
- **Business Administration**: Assume the prior likelihood of being enrolled in business administration is also moderate, say 0.15.

### Computing Posterior Probabilities
Since we don't have the specific value for \( P(E) \), we can compare the posterior probabilities relative to each other:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these to make them comparable (note that the total does not need to equal 1):

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.14}{0.20} = 0.7 \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.20} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the estimated conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
