Sure, I can guide you through the thought process for using Bayes' rule to estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H | E) \). However, precise numerical values for these probabilities would require more specific data than we have. Here's an outline of the reasoning process:

**Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**Definitions:**
- \( P(H | E) \) = The probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E | H) \) = The probability of Adam having the personality traits (given in E) if he were in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) = The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) = The total probability of the personality traits described in E across all fields.

### Understanding the terms:

1. **\( P(E | H) \):**
    - For **computer science**: The field often attracts individuals with high intelligence, strong ability to understand abstract concepts, enjoy solving puzzles, and may be quieter. These traits match well with Adam's sketch.
    - For **business administration**: The personality traits described are less commonly associated with business administration, where interpersonal skills, assertiveness, and leadership may be more emphasized.

2. **\( P(H) \):**
    - This depends on the overall distribution of graduate students across different fields. Without specific data, we might assume a similar proportion of students in each.

3. **\( P(E) \):**
    - This is the same for both fields since it's the overall probability of the personality traits across all students.
    
Given only the qualitative nature of our data and these observations, allow me to provide an indicative estimate:

### Making Assumptions:

Let's assume, without specific numeric data, that:
- The traits described fit better (are more likely) with computer science than business administration.
- For simplicity, let's say initially the priors \( P(H) \) are equal: \( 0.5 \) for both fields (since we lack precise data).

### Estimations:

Given that:

\[ P(H | E) \propto P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

- Suppose \( P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \) for computer science.
- Suppose \( P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \) for business administration.

Then:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15
\]

**Normalizing** (for an isolated comparison and just two fields considered):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.15} = \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) = \frac{0.15}{0.4 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273
\]

So, in our simplified estimation framework we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.727",
  "business administration": "0.273"
}
```

Please note these are indicative values based on qualitative matching and simplifying assumptions. Exact probabilities would require detailed data on field distributions and personality correlations.
