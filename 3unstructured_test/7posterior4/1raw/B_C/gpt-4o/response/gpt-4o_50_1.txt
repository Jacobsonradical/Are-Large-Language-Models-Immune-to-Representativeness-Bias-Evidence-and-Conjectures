To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand Bayes' rule mathematically:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have concrete numbers for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will rely on qualitative analysis based on the description of Adam's personality traits and the common characteristics associated with each field.

### Analysis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H) for Business Administration (H)**: Business administration typically values traits like leadership, strategic thinking, and decision-making. Adam's qualities such as empathy and appreciation for hard work align reasonably with these values. However, his interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his quiet and puzzle-solving nature, might make him less likely to be in a business-centric environment.
   - **P(H) for Business Administration**: Given the general population, a decent proportion of graduate students might be in business administration.
   - **Overall Likelihood**: Moderately Low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H) for Computer Science (H)**: Computer Science often requires strong problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and a high level of intelligenceâ€”all qualities that Adam possesses. His quiet and puzzle-solving nature might align well with the typical computer science student's traits. Additionally, while an interest in nature isn't a direct indicator, it doesn't conflict with studying computer science.
   - **P(H) for Computer Science**: Computer Science is a highly popular field for graduate studies.
   - **Overall Likelihood**: Moderately High.

Given these qualitative assessments, we will assign probabilities that reflect a greater likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science compared to Business Administration.

### Estimated Probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These probabilities are not exact but serve as an estimation based on the provided personality sketch and typical requirements and traits of the fields mentioned. The sum of these probabilities does not add up to 1 since we have not considered other fields of study that Adam could be involved in.
