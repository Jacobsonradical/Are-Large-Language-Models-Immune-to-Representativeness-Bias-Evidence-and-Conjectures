To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, which are not provided in the problem statement. However, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch to estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let’s assume that:
1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is uniform and equal, i.e., \( P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) can be estimated based on the alignment of Adam's qualities with typical characteristics required for each field.

Given Adam's qualities (curiosity about nature, puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), we can infer the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \): Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. Therefore, we can assign a relatively high likelihood.
- \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \): Aligning Adam’s empathy, appreciation for hard work, and warm heart with business administration is less direct. Hence, the likelihood may be lower than for computer science.

Now we assume:
1. \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \)
2. \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.3 \)

Given these assumptions and the uniform priors, we can calculate:

\[ 
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)}
\]
\[ 
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we normalize these to find the relative probabilities:

Let:
\[ k = \frac{1}{P(E)} \]

Then:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = k \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = k \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.5 \]

The normalization factor \( k \) can be ignored in the relative comparison. Therefore, we have:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = 0.35 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = 0.15 \]

So, we arrive at the conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```
