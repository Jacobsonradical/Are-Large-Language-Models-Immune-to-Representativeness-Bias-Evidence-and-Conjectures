To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) (which can be found by summing over all possible hypotheses \( H \)).

However, since we are only comparing two specific fields (business administration and computer science) and we are not given the prior probabilities or specific likelihoods, we'll need to make informed estimates based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Given E:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, loves animals, has high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions based on these traits:

1. For business administration:
   - Business administration typically focuses more on management, leadership, finance, marketing, and operations.
   - Traits such as empathy and understanding dedication could be relevant, but curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and love for animals might be less directly relevant to this field.

2. For computer science:
   - Computer science often involves problem-solving, working with abstract concepts, and possibly even applications related to nature (e.g., environmental modeling).
   - Puzzle-solving, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are directly relevant to this field.

Based on these traits, we can make an educated guess about the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Moderately low, as not all traits strongly align with this field.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Higher, as more traits strongly align with this field.

Without exact probabilities, we can infer relative values. Assuming priors are equal (without more information), we can use the qualitative assessments to make a rough estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective and based on our assessment of the information provided in the personality sketch relative to the typical demands and characteristics of these fields.
