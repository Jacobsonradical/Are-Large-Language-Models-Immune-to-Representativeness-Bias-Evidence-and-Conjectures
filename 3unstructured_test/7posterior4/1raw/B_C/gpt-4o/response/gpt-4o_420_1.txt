To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam's field of study based on the given personality sketch, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \) (personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \).

Without specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and exact likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we need to make some reasoned assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with each field and Adam's personality.

**Assumptions:**
1. Adam's curiosity about nature, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could align more with fields requiring abstract thinking and problem-solving.
2. Computer science and business administration fields have different primary characteristics that might or might not align with Adam's described traits.

### Likelihood Estimations:
- **Computer Science:** 
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking align well; curiosity about nature is neutral.
  - Estimation: \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \)

- **Business Administration:** 
  - Requires strong understanding and appreciation for hard work; empathy and warm heart can be advantageous for leadership roles.
  - Estimation: \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.4 \)

### Prior Probabilities Estimations:
- Assuming Adam’s likelihood of enrolling in each of these fields has no prior bias and given limited information, we can assign equal initial prior probabilities.
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.5 \)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities:
If we had \( P(E) \), we could normalize the probabilities. However, with assumptions and focusing on relative probabilities, the posterior estimation remains relative without precise normalization.

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.2 \]

Given that these values are relative:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values highlight the relative likelihoods of Adam’s enrollment based on his personality traits but do not sum to 1 due to the absence of normalizing \( P(E) \).
