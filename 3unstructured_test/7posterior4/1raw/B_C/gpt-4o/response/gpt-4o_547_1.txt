To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to describe Bayes' theorem in a form applicable to this situation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch, which serves as a normalizing constant.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity (as there's no specific information about Adam favoring one field over another), the comparison primarily depends on \( P(E|H) \).

For each field:
1. **Business Administration:** Considering Adam's interests and personality traits (love for nature, puzzles, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), this field does not appear to align strongly with his traits.
2. **Computer Science:** This field fits well with Adam’s intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and enjoyment of puzzles. However, it’s less directly connected to his interests in nature and animals, although it's relatively common for students in this field to have a broad range of interests.

Without specific numerical details, we'll use qualitative reasoning for approximations:

- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration is relatively low due to the less direct alignment with Adam’s personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science is moderately high due to the fit with his problem-solving abilities and abstract thinking.

Let's assign rough probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:

1. \( P(E| \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.2 \)
2. \( P(E| \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.5 \)

Given equal priors \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = P(\text{Computer Science}) \):

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \] is lower because of the mismatch, so let's assume:

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \]

For Computer Science, we infer:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \]

Putting these values into Bayesian context without exact \( P(E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

Given the subjective nature, these are rough approximations. For precise values, more context and numerical data are essential.
