To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd need to know certain prior probabilities and the likelihoods associated with personality traits for each field. Since that information isn't provided, we will use reasonable assumptions. The Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific likelihoods and prior probabilities, we can't compute exact numerical values. Instead, we make qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Assumptions:

1. **P(E | H) (Likelihood)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in a specific field.
   - **Computer Science**: High likelihood because curiosity, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators of a fit.
   - **Business Administration**: Lower likelihood because although empathy and understanding dedication are relevant, the traits match less closely compared to Computer Science.

2. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Assuming an equal distribution among various fields.
   - Generally, the number of students in computer science and business administration are likely similar in many universities, especially at the graduate level.

3. **P(E)** (Normalization Constant): Since this is the same for both fields, it cancels out when comparing them.

### Estimation:

#### For Computer Science:

- **Curiosity about nature**: Neutral (doesn't strongly correlate with computer science but isn't uncommon).
- **Puzzle-solving**: Strongly correlates.
- **Warm heart and empathy**: Generally neutral but can be unrelated to computer science.
- **Love for animals**: Not particularly indicative.
- **High intelligence and abstract concepts**: Strongly correlates.
- **Appreciation for hard work**: Correlates positively.

Given these qualitative assessments:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \approx 0.7 \]

#### For Business Administration:

- **Curiosity about nature**: Neutral with less direct relevance.
- **Puzzle-solving**: May not be as central.
- **Warm heart and empathy**: Strongly correlates.
- **Love for animals**: Again, not particularly indicative.
- **High intelligence and abstract concepts**: Correlates but less directly.
- **Appreciation for hard work**: Also correlates positively but common in many fields.

Given these qualitative assessments:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \approx 0.3 \]

Therefore, based on these qualitative considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the stronger fit of Adam's personality traits with the field of computer science compared to business administration, according to reasonable qualitative assumptions.
