To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for the fields of computer science and business administration, given Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we can use Bayes' rule. However, without actual numerical data regarding the base rates of students in each field and the likelihoods of having such personality traits in each field, precise probabilities cannot be computed. Nonetheless, I can offer an educated estimate based on the given information:

- **Bayes' Rule**: \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\)
  - \(P(H)\): Prior probability of being in a specific field.
  - \(P(E|H)\): Likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given enrolled in that field.
  - \(P(E)\): Total probability of having Adam's personality traits across all fields.

**Estimates**:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - People in computer science often have high intelligence and are good at solving puzzles, which matches Adam's traits.
   - Many might also appreciate hard work and dedication.
   - While not universally characteristic, a significant number in this field may also have an interest in abstract concepts.
   - Given Adam's empathy and love for animals, it's not typically a primary area for those traits, but it doesn't exclude the possibility entirely.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - This field typically focuses more on interpersonal skills, management, and economics.
   - Empathy and a warm heart are beneficial, but an interest in nature, animals, and solving puzzles may not be as relevant.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well but may not be as strong a fit as computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments and without precise data, I'll provide the following estimates:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
These values qualitatively reflect the approximate fit of Adam's personality traits with the respective fields of study. For a more precise calculation, more specific information on prior probabilities and likelihoods would be needed.
