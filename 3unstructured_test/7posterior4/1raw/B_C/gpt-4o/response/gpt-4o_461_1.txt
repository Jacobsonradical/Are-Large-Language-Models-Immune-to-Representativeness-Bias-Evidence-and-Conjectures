To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), and the overall likelihood of the evidence \( P(E) \). Here is Bayes' rule for reference:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, with the information provided, we cannot compute accurate numerical probabilities without additional data such as prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and detailed likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Instead, we can qualitatively assess which field is more likely given the personality sketch.

Given Adam's detailed personality traits:
- Strong curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Empathy and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can evaluate how well these traits align with each field:

1. **Business Administration**
   - Traits such as appreciation for hard work and understanding abstract concepts can be a good fit.
   - However, the strong feelings for nature, plant life, and empathy for animals might be less directly applicable to business administration.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles and high intelligence are strongly relevant.
   - Understanding abstract concepts is essential in computer science.
   - While empathy and love for animals are less directly related, curiosity can align with research in areas such as artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, or computational biology.

Based on qualitative assessment, we can say the traits are more indicative of computer science rather than business administration. Assuming equal prior probabilities for each field could lead us to believe computer science is a more likely field. Therefore, without exact numerical data, we can give a qualitative proxy:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective and indicative based on how well Adam's traits align with each field.
