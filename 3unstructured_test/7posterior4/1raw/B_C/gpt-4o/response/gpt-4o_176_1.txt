To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in computer science (CS) and business administration, as well as the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **Computer Science**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: This is the probability Adam is enrolled in computer science. Let's assume a moderate prior since CS is a common field for high-intelligence individuals with an interest in abstract concepts and problem-solving.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Given Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and his high intelligence in abstract thinking, these traits are favorable for someone in CS. However, his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals are less typical for CS, making the likelihood moderate.

2. **Business Administration**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: This is the probability Adam is enrolled in business administration. Let’s assume a moderate prior for this as well, since BA is a common field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Adam’s warm heart, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication can be seen as valuable in business administration. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his inclination toward abstract concepts, make this less typical for BA, resulting in a lower likelihood.

Now, let's provide an approximation of the posterior probabilities.

Given the assumptions:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \]

To derive the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) = 0.3 + 0.15 = 0.45 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} = \frac{0.3}{0.45} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} = \frac{0.15}{0.45} \approx 0.33 \]

Conclusively:
{
  "computer science": "0.67",
  "business administration": "0.33"
}
