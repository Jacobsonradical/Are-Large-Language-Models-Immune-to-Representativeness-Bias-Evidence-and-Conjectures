To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to interpret and apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Without exact prior probabilities and specific likelihoods for each field, we will make reasoned estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Reasoning:

- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with common attributes of students in computer science. A strong likelihood \( P(E|H) \) can be inferred here.
- **Business Administration**: The attributes highlighted for Adam (quiet, empathy, love for animals, strong appreciation for hard work) do not typically align as clearly with business administration, which might prioritize traits such as risk-taking, leadership, and negotiation skills. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is considered lower here.

Given these considerations, and without explicit numerical values for priors, we qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect a higher posterior probability for Adam being in computer science relative to business administration, while acknowledging that the total does not sum to 1 as there are other possible fields.
