To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of those fields and the likelihood of the evidence (Adam’s personality sketch) given each hypothesis. Unfortunately, without specific prior and likelihood values, we can’t give exact numerical probabilities. However, we can qualitatively assess the fit based on the personality traits provided.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's consider the fields one by one:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Given Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence, he could very well be a fit for computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
   - However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals are not directly related to this field.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - While business administration requires a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the other aspects of Adam's personality sketch (such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature) do not align particularly well with what is typically emphasized in a business administration program.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can tentatively say that Adam is more likely to be in computer science than business administration given the provided personality traits. Here are the relatively estimated values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note, these numbers are speculative and based on a qualitative assessment rather than precise calculation. For accurate probabilities, exact prior and likelihood values would be required.
