To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihoods of the observations given the hypotheses. Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since exact numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are not provided in the problem statement, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given sketch of Adam's personality and typical features of the specified fields.

### Assumptions:
- **Likelihoods:** 
  - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality traits are observed given the enrollment in the specified field.
  - **Computer Science:** Adam's traits such as love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, curiosity about nature, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a high likelihood.
  - **Business Administration:** While empathy and understanding of hard work are valuable traits in business, Adam's specific interests in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts might make this field less likely.

- **Priors:** 
  - Without specific prior data, we assume reasonable priors based on typical distributions of graduate fields.

### Analysis:
Given Adam's personality traits aligning more with those commonly found in computer science, we can qualitatively suggest higher likelihoods and possibly higher priors for computer science over business administration.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Without exact numerical values, we approximate based on the given traits and their alignment with the fields:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \]

Normalize using:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + \dots \]

For simplicity, ignore the '...\' for other fields as they have insignificant impact.

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \times 0.2 + 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.04 + 0.18 = 0.22 \]

Now apply Bayes' rule for each:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.22} = \frac{0.04}{0.22} \approx 0.182 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.22} = \frac{0.18}{0.22} \approx 0.818 \]

### Result:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.182,
  "computer science": 0.818
}
```

These posterior probabilities align with the personality sketch provided for Adam, suggesting a stronger alignment with computer science.
