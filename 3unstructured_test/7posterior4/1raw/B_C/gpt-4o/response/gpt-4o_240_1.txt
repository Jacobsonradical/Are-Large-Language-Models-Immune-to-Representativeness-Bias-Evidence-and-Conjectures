To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the components involved in applying Bayes' Rule properly, which is:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we cannot compute exact values. Thus, we will provide qualitative estimations based on the given personality sketch.

For this problem:
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam was a computer science student.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam was a business administration student.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he was in business administration.

Given the personality sketch presented:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, and has high intelligence, which aligns well with the field of computer science.
- Meanwhile, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could also align with business administration, but the strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature doesn't strongly suggest a typical business administration profile.

Therefore, by qualitative analysis:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) & = \text{relatively high} \\
P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) & = \text{relatively low}
\end{align*}
\]

Based on the qualitative assessment, we can estimate values within the given range:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are estimates reflecting the strong alignment of Adamâ€™s characteristics with a computer science field.
