To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. Determine the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. Apply Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we lack precise data and need to make reasonable assumptions, we must assume some values:

- Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for a graduate student in 2021 in the U.S. to be in computer science (CS) or business administration (BA). For simplicity:
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (based on the popularity of the field)
  - \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.1 \) (lower, given fewer students in BA compared to CS and other fields)

- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): Highly intelligent individuals who like solving puzzles fit well with CS. Nature and plants are less relevant but might not be uncommon. Let’s assume \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \).
  - \( P(E|\text{BA}) \): Strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and understanding abstract concepts are relevant to BA, but nature and plants might be less so. Let’s assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.2 \).

- The evidence \( P(E) \) is the sum of probabilities for all fields, but since we are only considering two fields here and we aren't normalizing the results, we can focus only on the parts we have:
  - \( P(E) \approx P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA}) \)
  - So, \( P(E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.1 \)

Now, apply Bayes' rule for each field:

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.1} = 0.8 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.1} = 0.2 \]

So the posterior conditional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
