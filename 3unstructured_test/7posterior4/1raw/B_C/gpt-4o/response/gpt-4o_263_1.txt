To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need both the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Unfortunately, we don't have actual data to provide definitive probabilities, so we will need to estimate based on the given personality sketch and plausible assumptions.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, \( E \), and can be thought of as the sum of likelihoods across all possible hypotheses. Since we don't have explicit numbers for all fields or overall probabilities, we'll use educated guesses to approximate \( P(E) \) and estimate the conditional probabilities. 

Let's make some assumptions:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \): In general, a significant number of graduate students might be in computer science, which is a popular field. Let's assume a rough estimate that 1 out of 5 graduate students might be in computer science. So, \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, puzzle-solving skills, and appreciation for hard work align well with computer science. Let's give it a higher likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business Administration is also a common field. Let’s assume a similar rough estimate of 1 out of 5 graduate students being in this field. So, \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Traits like empathy, understanding hard work, and high intelligence can also apply here, but the alignment is perhaps not as strong with his nature and love for animals. Let’s give it a lower likelihood, say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

Now, to keep things simple, we will ignore the influence of \( P(E) \) (as it would be the same denominator for each calculation and hence cancel out in relative terms).

### Calculation:
Using the rough estimates for the likelihoods and priors:

1. **Computer Science:**
   \[
   P(H_{CS}|E) \approx P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12
   \]

2. **Business Administration:**
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
   \]

### Result:
Here are the estimated probabilities in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These values are based on the assumptions made about priors and likelihoods, and they provide a rough estimation based on the personality sketch and general knowledge about the fields.
