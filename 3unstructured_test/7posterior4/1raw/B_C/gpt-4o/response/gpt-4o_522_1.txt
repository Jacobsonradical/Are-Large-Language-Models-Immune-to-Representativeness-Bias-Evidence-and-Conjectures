To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need more information than given in the question, such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he's enrolled in each field.

However, I can make qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and assumptions about typical attributes in these fields. This won't be precise probability values but an educated guess based on the provided personality sketch.

For computer science (CS):
- Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles aligns with CS.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are beneficial in CS.
- Empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are not specifically aligned with or against CS but show a well-rounded personality, which could make CS plausible.

For business administration (BA):
- Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication are important in BA.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts understanding are also valuable in BA, especially concerning strategic planning and management.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals do not directly relate to BA but do not discount it either.

Given the qualitative analysis and knowing that these fields share some overlapping values but also differ in specifics (e.g., CS might be more technical problem-solving oriented, while BA might rely more on interpersonal skills and management), here is an approximate distribution:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These numbers reflect the reasoning that Adam's traits slightly lean more towards the technical and problem-solving aspects typical in CS, but his empathy and appreciation for hard work also make BA a considerable candidate. These values are hypothetical and intended to illustrate how his personality might match each field based on traits alignment.
