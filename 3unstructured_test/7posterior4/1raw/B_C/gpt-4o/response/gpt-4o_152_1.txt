To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the evidence given the hypothesis. Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have exact values for \( P(E) \) and \( P(H) \), we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

Let's denote:
- \( H_\text{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_\text{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in business administration.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:

- His genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence align more closely with fields that involve a deep understanding of natural and abstract concepts, like certain areas of computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence, computational biology) rather than business administration.
- His preference for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might be highly relevant to computer science but less so to business administration.

Thus, we assume:
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \) is relatively high because his traits are highly compatible with computer science.
- \( P(E|H_\text{BA}) \) is relatively low because his traits are less indicative of someone typically pursuing business administration.

For priors, let's assume:
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \) is relatively higher because computer science is a very common graduate field.
- \( P(H_\text{BA}) \) might be lower given the specific traits.

Using reasonable assumptions:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are based on qualitative reasoning rather than exact numerical data. If we had specific data on the distribution of graduate students in various fields and how their traits align with those fields, we could provide more precise calculations.
