To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Without concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we will assume a qualitative approach based on the given personality sketch \( E \) of Adam. The steps to calculate \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule are given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, lacking the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can make educated guesses based on the alignment of Adam's characteristics with the possible fields of study.

### Analysis:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns with skills beneficial in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be somewhat relevant but not specifically indicative of computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and a warm heart could be beneficial in leadership and management roles often associated with business administration, but these traits alone do not strongly point to business administration.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can also apply but are less exclusively relevant compared to a field like computer science.
   
Given that Adam's specifics (e.g., problem-solving inclination and high intelligence) seem to align more directly with attributes needed in computer science, we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities.

### Qualitative Estimates:
Assuming prior probabilities for the fields without specific data but based on general trends and suitability:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.6 \)
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.4 \)

Considering the likelihoods based on Adam's profile:
- \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.3 \)

Next, we need an idea of the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Let's assume it as a normalizing constant.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.6 = 0.48 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

Given these proportional values:
### Normalizing:
To get these probabilities to sum to 1:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.48}{0.48 + 0.12} = \frac{0.48}{0.60} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.48 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.60} = 0.2 \]

Expressing these in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these values are estimates based on qualitative interpretation and should ideally be refined with more specific data for the priors and likelihoods.
