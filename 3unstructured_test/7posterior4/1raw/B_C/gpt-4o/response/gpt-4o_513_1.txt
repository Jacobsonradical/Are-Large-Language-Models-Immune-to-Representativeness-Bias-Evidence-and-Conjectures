To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand two things:

1. **Bayes' Rule**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
2. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \).

Without specific datasets, we can't compute precise probabilities, but we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the personality sketch.

### Assessing Likelihoods:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts indicate a strong fit for computer science, which involves significant problem-solving and conceptual thinking. His curiosity and empathy aren't directly leveraged by computer science, but they don't detract from it either.
  
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): High, given the alignment on intelligence and problem-solving skills.
  - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to high, as computer science is a popular field for highly intelligent individuals.

- **Business Administration**: Although understanding the hard work and dedication is relevant, his personality sketch focuses more on empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, which align less directly with business administration.

  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Lower, given less alignment with Adam's key traits like deep love for animals.
  - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Lower, as business administration generally attracts individuals with a more direct interest in business-related skills.

### Estimating Posterior Probabilities:
Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide some indicative values. Note that these values are rough approximations:

{
  "computer science": "0.70",
  "business administration": "0.30"
}

This qualitative inference suggests that Adam is more likely to be in Computer Science than in Business Administration, but without precise data, these values should be taken as educated estimates.
