To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \): These are the probabilities of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Determine the Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): These are the probabilities of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in each field.
3. **Compute Posterior Probabilities** \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule is mathematically expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) is the hypothesis about Adam being enrolled in specific fields (like computer science or business administration).

### Assumptions:
- Without specific prior information, we'll assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are roughly equal for different graduate fields.
- We'll make educated estimates for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on traits matching each field.

#### Estimating Likelihoods:
- **Computer Science (CS)**: High intelligence, good abstract problem-solving, and puzzle-solving fit well. Curiosity is also a trait that could align. However, empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly relevant.
- **Business Administration (BA)**: Communication and interpersonal skills are typically strong in this field. While empathy could be a fit, the traits like a love for nature and solving puzzles are less directly aligned.

Given these considerations:

- **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Likelihood for computer science might be moderately high due to relevance of intelligence and problem-solving.
- **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Likelihood for business administration might be lower because business requires different typical attributes.

Using these insights, we can qualitatively estimate and then approximate probabilities.

### Posterior Probabilities:
- Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity, let's say \( P(H_{CS}) \approx P(H_{BA}) \).
- Normalizing Bayesian posterior probabilities would entail estimating each specifically in a real-world scenario; here, we keep it simple.

Given the qualitative matching and assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are estimations using the likelihoods observed and should ideally be refined with real data for a precise computation.
