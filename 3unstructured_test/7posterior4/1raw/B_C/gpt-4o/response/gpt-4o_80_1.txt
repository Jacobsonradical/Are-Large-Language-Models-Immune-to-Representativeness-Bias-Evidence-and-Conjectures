To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to also consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of his personality traits given each field of study. Without concrete prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), I'll provide rough estimates based on common associations with these fields and Adam's personality traits.

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant (total probability of the evidence).

### Assumptions
- \( P(H) \): We'll assume a prior where computer science and business administration are equally likely initially given Adam's traits.
- \( P(E|H) \):
  - For computer science, Adam's traits like high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts are highly indicative.
  - For business administration, traits like strong empathy and appreciation for dedication might fit, but less so than the traits aligning with computer science.

With these considerations, here's a rough estimation:

{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.35"
}

These estimates are illustrative; actual probabilities could differ substantially with more specific information about the population distribution of graduate students in these fields and how common these traits are within each specific discipline.
