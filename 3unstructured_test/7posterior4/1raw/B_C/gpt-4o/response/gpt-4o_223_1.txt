To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have the exact values for these priors and likelihoods, we will make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch of Adam (denoted as \( E \)).

To remind ourselves, Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (e.g., probability that a student is enrolled in business administration or computer science in general).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can often be considered as a normalizing constant in these contexts.

Assumptions based on the personality traits and graduate field expectations:
- Adam's traits such as a curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts might align more closely with certain fields over others.

**Estimation of Priors and Likelihoods:**

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in business administration. 

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science. 

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{CS} \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.

Since we lack specific data, let's qualitatively estimate:

- **Business Administration:** Given Adam's personality traits, we might assume lower probabilities since business administration typically does not require an intrinsic curiosity about nature or a deep love for animals, though empathy might be relevant.
  - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume 0.2 (relatively common field).
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Lower likelihood, say 0.05.

- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence, liking for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
  - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): Say 0.3 (popular field for graduate students).
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Higher likelihood, say 0.4.

However, we need to normalize using the denominator \( P(E) \), but we'll present unnormalized results since no normalization factor is supplied.

### Posterior probabilities:

For \( H_{BA} \):
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01
\]

For \( H_{CS} \):
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12
\]

The posterior probabilities without normalization would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

If we were to normalize these results (though not required per the instruction as other fields may exist):

Normalized \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) = \( \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.12} ≈ 0.077 \)

Normalized \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) = \( \frac{0.12}{0.01 + 0.12} ≈ 0.923 \)

Note: Additional information about other fields would lead to a more comprehensive normalization.
