To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I will reason qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch to inform our estimates:

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): High, as computer science often attracts individuals with strong intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving interests.
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): The prior for computer science might be moderate to high, given the popularity and ample opportunities in the field.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Moderate to low, as business administration typically attracts individuals interested in management and entrepreneurship, which might not strongly correlate with Adam's personality sketch emphasizing nature and empathy.
   - \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): The prior for business administration might be moderate, given its broad appeal.

Now, we'll consider:
- \( P(E) \): While unknown, this value remains constant and cancels out in the relative comparison.

Assuming plausible estimates based on the personality sketch:

\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{\text{High likelihood and moderate to high prior}}{\text{Common marginal likelihood}} \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}) = \frac{\text{Moderate to low likelihood and moderate prior}}{\text{Common marginal likelihood}} \approx 0.3 \]

Final estimates:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are qualitative guesses. For more accurate estimates, actual data on priors and likelihoods would be needed.
