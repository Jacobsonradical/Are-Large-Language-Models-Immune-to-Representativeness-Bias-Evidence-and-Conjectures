To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Generally in such cases, we need to rely on qualitative assessments and reasonable assumptions for these probabilities.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let us make some educated guesses about the likelihoods.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's traits is relatively low. Business Administration students might possess some of these traits, but it's not as common. Let's assume \( 0.1 \).
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in business administration might be moderate. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's traits is higher, as computer science often requires solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and a general curiosity. Let's assume \( 0.4 \).
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any random graduate student is in computer science might also be moderate. Let's assume \( 0.2 \).

3. **P(E)**: The evidence \( P(E) \) is the same for both computations and can be considered a normalizing constant, hence not directly required for computing the relative probabilities.

Since we only need to compare the probabilities and don't need an absolute value, we can use the product of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) as a proxy for the likelihood:

Given these assumptions:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08
}
```

Hence, the comparative probabilities (not normalized) are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

Therefore, in the format requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```
