To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), and also the prior probabilities of each field, which we don't have explicitly. For simplicity, I will make reasonable assumptions about these priors based on typical graduate program enrollments.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence. 

Since we are not provided with exact values, let's assume uniform prior probabilities for simplicity, i.e., \( P(H) \) is the same for each field. The focus will be on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

### Computer Science
Let's denote this as \( H_{CS} \):

Adam's personality traits:
- Curiosity about nature and plants (Neutral/less relevant to CS)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (Positive for CS)
- High intelligence (Positive for CS)
- Understanding abstract concepts (Positive for CS)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals (Less relevant to CS)

Overall, the traits "enjoys solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "understanding abstract concepts" are particularly strong indicators for computer science.

### Business Administration
Let's denote this as \( H_{BA} \):

Adam's personality traits:
- Curiosity about nature and plants (Less relevant to BA)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (Moderate relevance for BA)
- High intelligence (Positive for BA)
- Understanding abstract concepts (Positive for BA)
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals (Positive for BA)

While business administration could also align with Adam's empathy and abstract thinking, the enjoyment of solving puzzles is generally less central to business administration compared to computer science.

So, based on the qualitative assessment:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,  // Strong alignment with some key traits
  "business administration": 0.3  // Moderate alignment, but less strong
}

Note: These numbers are subjective estimates based on the given personality traits and how they relate to each field. Actual probabilities would require detailed data about enrollment tendencies and the distribution of personality traits in different fields.
