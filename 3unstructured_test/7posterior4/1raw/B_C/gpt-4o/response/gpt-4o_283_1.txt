To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must apply the formula:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E \mid H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will rely on qualitative reasoning to provide an estimated value.

### Business Administration

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Typically, one might assume a graduate student has some probability of enrolling in business administration, but given Adam’s interest in nature, animals, puzzles, and high intelligence, it seems less relevant.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \)**: There is a lower probability that a business administration student would exhibit strong empathy for animals, a deep love for nature, and an interest in solving puzzles.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The general evidence suggests Adam’s characteristics are less likely in graduate students of business administration.

Combining these assessments, the posterior probability for business administration is likely low.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular field among graduate students, providing a moderate prior.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E \mid H) \)**: A computer science student would likely have high intelligence, the ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoy solving puzzles. While stronger empathy and love for nature and animals might be less common, they are not contradictory.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The evidence fits reasonably for computer science students, particularly due to intelligence and puzzle-solving traits.

Thus, the posterior probability for computer science is relatively higher.

Using this qualitative reasoning, the approximate probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

These values are estimates based on the given personality sketch, assuming typical characteristics and interests of students in these fields.
