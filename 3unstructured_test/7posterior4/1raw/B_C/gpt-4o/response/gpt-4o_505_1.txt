To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), using Bayes' rule, we'll generally need:

1. The prior probabilities, \( P(H) \), which represent how common it is for a graduate student in the U.S. to be enrolled in these respective fields.
2. The likelihood, \( P(E|H) \), which represents how likely it is for someone in those fields to have the personality traits described.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since precise numerical data for these probabilities aren’t provided in the question, we’ll have to make reasonable estimates based on typical attributes and available information.

**Assumptions:**

- For simplicity, I'll assume equal priors, that \( P(H=\text{computer science}) = P(H=\text{business administration}) \).
- Given the traits defined in E — curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work — we can qualitatively estimate which fields are more likely to fit these attributes.

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science

- Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles might fit well with computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also consistent with success in computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals aren't typically primary traits in this field but don't preclude it.

Thus, \( P(E|H=\text{computer science}) \) can be considered moderate to high.

#### Business Administration

- Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work fit well with business administration.
- Interest in nature and solving puzzles are less central but still can be relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are advantageous but not exclusive to this field.

Thus, \( P(E|H=\text{business administration}) \) can be considered moderate.

Since we are asked for qualitative probabilities, let’s assign approximate probabilities.

### Calculated Probabilities:

Given the qualitative assessment, we might come up with the following posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.35"
}
```

These values reflect an estimation where Adam’s traits fit better with computer science but also have a considerable overlap with business administration.
