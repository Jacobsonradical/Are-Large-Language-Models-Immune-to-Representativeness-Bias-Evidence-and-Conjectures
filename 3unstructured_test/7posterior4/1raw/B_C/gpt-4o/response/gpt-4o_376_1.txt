To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field, the likelihood of the evidence given the enrollment, and the evidence itself. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical prior probabilities and individual likelihoods for each hypothesis, we'll have to make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \). 

Let's consider the likelihoods qualitatively:

- **Business Administration**: The field typically involves a focus on leadership, management, economics, and finance. These might not immediately align with Adam's strong empathy, love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving and might be a lower likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).

- **Computer Science**: This field involves significant problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and patterns, which align with Adam's interest in puzzles and his high intelligence. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is higher.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity \( P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) \). We'll normalize our results afterward to communicate our qualitative insights without explicit numbers.

Let's denote the qualitative likelihoods out of a normalized scale, assuming:

\( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
\( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.8 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ rule without specific priors and exact evidence denominator, we'll provide relative likelihoods:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4
\]

We'll then normalize to stay within a probability range where the values reflect our qualitative assumptions:

Total = \( 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \)

Normalized posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.8"
}

These are rough qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and assumptions for priors and likelihoods, so they should be refined with actual data if available.
