To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Here's Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have the exact priors \( P(H) \) or the exact likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can provide a qualitative evaluation based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam demonstrates high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and has an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. These are traits that are well-aligned with computer science, which often requires strong logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication; however, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, coupled with a quiet demeanor, does not align as closely with the typically social and high-energy environment often associated with business administration.

Using this reasoning to guide our subjective assessment of the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,  
  "business administration": 0.2  
}

While these values are subjective, they reflect the fit between Adam's traits and the typical requirements or environment of each field.

Note: Without precise numerical data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, these values are rough estimates.
