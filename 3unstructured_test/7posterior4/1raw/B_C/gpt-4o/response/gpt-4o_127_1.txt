To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more specific information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of the personality traits given each field. However, given the constraints and the qualitative nature of these attributes, I will provide a reasoned estimation rather than a precise calculation.

Based on Adam's personality sketch (E) and the likely fit with the fields given:

1. **Business Administration:** This field typically values skills such as leadership, management, and strategic thinking. While Adam's curiosity, empathy, and love for animals can be beneficial, the personality trait sketch provided is not strongly aligned with the typical attributes and interests of someone pursuing business administration.

2. **Computer Science:** This field often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts, aligning well with Adam's personality. Furthermore, Adam's quiet nature and genuine curiosity about abstract concepts would fit more naturally in a field that requires deep problem-solving and analytical skills.

Given these considerations, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values suggest a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, in part due to his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, both of which are commonly associated with computer science.
