To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have exact quantitative priors and likelihoods, the computation will be more qualitative, based on matching Adam's personality sketch to the typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Computer Science
- **Curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This is not particularly aligned with computer science.
- **Enjoyment of solving puzzles**: Highly aligned with computer science.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: These traits are not generally associated specifically with computer science.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Highly aligned with computer science.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This trait is general and can apply to any field.

The strongest indicators are enjoyment of puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, both of which are highly aligned with computer science. Therefore, the probability \( P(H|E) \) for computer science would be relatively high.

### Business Administration
- **Curiosity about nature and its various plants**: This is not particularly aligned with business administration.
- **Enjoyment of solving puzzles**: This can be aligned but is not a dominant trait in business administration.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: Empathy can be important in business for leadership and customer relations, but love for animals is not particularly aligned.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Generally beneficial in business but not a key indicator.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: This can apply to any field.

The characteristics of warm-heartedness and empathy do align to some extent with business administration, as these traits are valuable in leadership and team roles, but the alignment is not as strong as with computer science.

Given the qualitative assessment above, the relative posterior probabilities could be estimated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are not absolute but represent a subjective estimation based on the characteristics given in the personality sketch.
