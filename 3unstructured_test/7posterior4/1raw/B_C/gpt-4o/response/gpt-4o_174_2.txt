To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we must first understand Bayes' theorem which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \) (a normalization factor).

Assumptions:
1. We assume some typical rates of graduate students in different fields.
2. We estimate the likelihood of the personality sketch fitting each field.

Given the personality sketch "\( E \)" of Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's denote our assumptions for the prior \( P(H) \) based on the typical distribution of graduate students in these fields (rough estimates):

- \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.25 \)

Next, we estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on the personality sketch.

### For Business Administration:
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate to Low
  - Warm heart and empathy: Moderate
  - Deep love for animals: Low
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Moderate
  - Appreciation for hard work: High

Combining these, we might assign a likelihood value:
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.05 \]

### For Computer Science:
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \):
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: Moderate (since many CS people are broadly interested)
  - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
  - Warm heart and empathy: Moderate
  - Deep love for animals: Moderate
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
  - Appreciation for hard work: High

Combining these, we might assign a likelihood value:
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor and the same for all calculated fields, we can ignore it for relative comparison.

Now applying Bayes' rule:

### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 \]

Thus the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0075,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```

These values show a significantly higher probability for "computer science" compared to "business administration" given the personality sketch of Adam.
