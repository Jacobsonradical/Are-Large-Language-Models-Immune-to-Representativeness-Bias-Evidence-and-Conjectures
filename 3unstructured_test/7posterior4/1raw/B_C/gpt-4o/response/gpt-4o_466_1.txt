To apply Bayes' Rule, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Applying this to each field:

1. **Business Administration**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This would generally be the proportion of graduate students in business administration.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This reflects how likely a student in business administration has the traits mentioned in E.

2. **Computer Science**

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This would generally be the proportion of graduate students in computer science.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This reflects how likely a student in computer science has the traits mentioned in E.

Given:
- Curious about nature and plants
- Quiet, enjoys puzzles
- Warm-hearted, empathetic
- Love for animals
- Highly intelligent, understands abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Assumptions:**

- \(P(H)\) values are roughly comparable for different fields as the distribution of graduate students can vary but not overly skewed.
- \(P(E)\) is constant as evidence is given and applies to all calculations.

### Bayesian Update (we'll make some reasonable assumptions about \(P(E|H)\)):

#### Business Administration:
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) may be relatively low due to the mismatch (traits better aligned with science, creativity, intuition rather than management).
- Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.10 \)

#### Computer Science:
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is relatively high, matches traits of someone who is intelligent, enjoys puzzles, understands abstract concepts.
- Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.15 \)

With these assumptions:

**Posterior Probabilities:**

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})
\]

Let's assume \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05\) (low due to mismatch), \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.25\).

Normalize using an estimated evidence term where both rough equal proportions add to be valid.

Using assumed constants:
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.10 = 0.005
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.25 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0375
\]

So, say priors adding up keep balance:

Using normalization \(P(H | E) \approx \frac{P(E|H)*P(H)}{\Sigma P(E|H)*P(H)}\):

Finally yielding normalized values close in ratio:

### Result

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.75"
}
```
These values reflect the respective probabilities considering general assumptions we highlighted earlier. The computer science field is more aligned with Adam's traits and thus shows higher posterior probability.
