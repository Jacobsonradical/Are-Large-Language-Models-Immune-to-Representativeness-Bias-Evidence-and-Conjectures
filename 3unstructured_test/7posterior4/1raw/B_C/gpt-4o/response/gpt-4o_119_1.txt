To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E | H) \) are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's description and the fields in question.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and strong appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely for him to be aligned with fields involving analytical and natural sciences rather than business administration.

**Assumptions:**

- \( P(E) \) remains the same for both the hypotheses as it is constant across them.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science vs. business administration, will be assumed to be roughly equal if no additional information is provided, but we will adjust based on fit to Adam's personality profile.
- \( P(E | H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality given the field, is estimated based on matching his traits to the fields.

### Estimation:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts
   - Enjoys solving puzzles

   These traits are highly indicative of someone in the computer science field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and warm heart
   - Appreciation for hard work

   While these traits are important, they are more generally applicable.

Given these considerations, here's a qualitative estimation of \( P(E | H) \):

- \( P(E | H = \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E | H = \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.4 \)

If we assume equal prior probabilities for both fields \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.5 \):

- For Computer Science:
  \( P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \)

- For Business Administration:
  \( P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.2 \)

Normalization is not required as there are other fields that E could map to and we're asked for non-normalized values.
