To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) which represents the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, it is impossible to provide precise computed values. Instead, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis based on the information in the personality sketch, and form an educated estimate.

**Computer Science**:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align with traits beneficial for computer science.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, also associated with computer science problem-solving.
- Empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are common but not exclusive to computer science.

**Business Administration**:
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable in business administration.
- Empathy can be beneficial in a business setting for leadership and team management.
- Curiosity about nature and plants, while not directly related, does not exclude business administration.
- Quietness may be less common but not unheard of in business roles.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the relative likelihoods as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Prior} (P(H)): \text{Assume relatively equal priors due to lack of specific data.} \\
& P(E|H_{\text{CompSci}}): \text{High, due to alignment with problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking.} \\
& P(E|H_{\text{BusAdmin}}): \text{Moderate-High, due to empathy and dedication qualities.}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, our qualitative assessments would translate into relatively higher values for computer science, reflecting a stronger alignment with the given traits, compared to business administration.

Using these qualitative insights, the estimated probabilities are:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& P(H|E_{\text{CompSci}}) = \sim 0.7 \\
& P(H|E_{\text{BusAdmin}}) = \sim 0.3
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective and should be revisited with actual prior probabilities and likelihoods for more precise computation.
