To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), the prior probability of \( H \), and the evidence \( E \) itself. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack specific numerical values for these probabilities and the base rate frequencies of graduate students in the fields of computer science and business administration, I'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on common scenarios.

Let's summarize some key aspects from Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's assess how likely it is he'd be a graduate student in computer science or business administration.

### Likelihoods:

#### Computer Science:
- Likely traits: solving puzzles (good at coding and algorithms), abstract concepts, high intelligence.
- Less related: nature and plants, strong empathy (though empathy in computer-human interaction and user-centric design is valued).

#### Business Administration:
- Likely traits: strong empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work, high intelligence.
- Less related: curiosity about nature/plants, solving puzzles.

Next, let's make general assumptions about the two fields:
- Generally, computer science programs might have a higher prior probability (\( P(\text{computer science}) \)) due to the large number of students in this field.
- Business administration also has a substantial number of students, but it might not be as high as computer science.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Without actual numbers, this becomes a comparison exercise. Assuming:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \) and \( P(\text{business administration}) \) are roughly proportional to typical enrollments.
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) = higher due to puzzle-solving and abstract thinking.
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) = moderate due to empathy and understanding hard work.

Now, estimating \( P(E) \) (the probability of the evidence, taking into account all possible fields) is trickier, but we won't calculate it explicitly since the comparative analysis focuses on likelihoods.

Given these insights:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are speculative and interpretative, reflecting that while Adam might be more naturally inclined towards computer science due to the nature of problem-solving and abstract concept understanding, his empathy and appreciation for hard work make business administration a considerable possibility.
