To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis. However, we don't have explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods given in the question, meaning we must make reasonable estimates based on the information provided in the personality sketch (E).

Given the data about Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He is quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and loves animals.
- He is highly intelligent and understands abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Based on this profile, we can reasonably hypothesize the following:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Typically, students in computer science are indeed highly intelligent and good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, there is no strong linkage to curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals which might be less common in this field.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration might attract individuals with strong interpersonal skills and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, the explicit love for nature, plants, and animals, along with strong empathy, might be less discernible in this field's typical profile.

Let's denote:
- Computer Science as \( H_{CS} \)
- Business Administration as \( H_{BA} \)

While we cannot provide exact numeric values without solid data, we can estimate the likelihoods based on qualitative reasoning.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This estimation suggests Adam has a slightly higher posterior probability of being in Computer Science compared to Business Administration, based on the given personality sketch. Note that these values are hypothetical and could vary with more context or data.
