To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we would typically need specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). In the absence of concrete numerical data, we make reasonable assumptions based on the personality traits described.

Given Adam's traits:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's consider how these traits might align with each field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity and intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts and problem-solving, heavily align with traits desirable in computer science.
   - Enjoying puzzles suggests an affinity for algorithmic thinking and software development.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy and a warm heart could be beneficial for leadership and management roles, indicating Adam could excel in business administration.
   - However, this field might not as closely match the stronger emphasis on nature, plants, and animals which are less directly related to business administration.

We will use qualitative reasoning to estimate our probabilities. Consider the traits more strongly related to Computer Science than to Business Administration based on Adam's sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in computer science than in business administration, but there is still a reasonable probability for the latter field.
