To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the basic components of Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make qualitative assessments based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- High intelligence and abstract concept understanding
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits suggest certain fields might be a better fit than others. For instance, fields like environmental science or biology might be a natural fit, but since we are focusing on business administration and computer science, we'll have to make educated guesses based on the traits.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically, business administration focuses on management, finance, marketing, etc. While empathy and dedication are useful traits here, Adam’s interest in nature, puzzles, and animals suggests it might not be the perfect fit.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Likelihood of having Adam's personality traits in business administration might be low.
   - \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Prior probability could be considered moderate, as it’s a common graduate field.
   
   Considering these factors, the posterior probability might be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science often involves problem-solving, logical thinking, and working with abstract concepts, which align with Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and his high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Likelihood of having Adam's personality traits in computer science might be higher compared to business administration.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Prior probability could also be considered moderate to high, given the increasing interest and applicability of computer science.
   
   Considering these factors, the posterior probability might be higher than business administration.

Thus, we might assume the relative probabilities without exact numbers as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note that these values are speculative and illustrative based on qualitative assessment, not exact calculations.
