To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality traits.

However, to simplify the calculation and provide reasonable estimates, we'll make some qualitative assessments rather than diving into the exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), which are typically hard to quantify without specific data. 

Given Adam's traits:
  - "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" suggests a possible inclination away from purely business-oriented fields unless it intersects with environmental or sustainability sectors within business.
  - "Solving puzzles," "high intelligence," and "understanding abstract concepts" are strongly indicative traits for computer science.
  - "Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals" could also align with fields connected to biology or environmental science more than business administration.
  - His appreciation for hard work and dedication is a bit more neutral but can apply broadly across both fields.

Based on these qualitative assessments, let's estimate the probabilities. Given Adam's personality traits, it seems more likely he would be in a field like computer science compared to business administration.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values are estimates based on the qualitative matching of his personality to the field. The probabilities do not sum to 1 to account for other possible fields Adam could be studying.
