To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll start with the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since exact numerical probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, we'll make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch and common knowledge about graduate fields.

Let's qualitatively reason through this:

### Computer Science:
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align moderately well with a computer science student. Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles can translate well into problem-solving in computer science. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators too.
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a common graduate field, so its prior probability is relatively high compared to some niche fields.

### Business Administration:
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics align less well with a business administration student. While empathy and a warm heart could be beneficial, the appreciation for nature, animals, and hard work doesn't strongly align with typical attributes of those in business administration. Problem-solving is relevant here, but perhaps less emphasized compared to computer science.
- **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common graduate field, so its prior probability is relatively high.

With qualitative reasoning, we expect:
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science to be higher than for business administration because Adam's profile fits better.
- \( P(H) \) is roughly similar for both fields.

Given that \( P(E) \) is constant for both fields once we compare the two, the differences mainly come from \( P(E|H) \).

Let's assign broad qualitative probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values derive from the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with the expected traits of a computer science graduate student compared to a business administration student.
