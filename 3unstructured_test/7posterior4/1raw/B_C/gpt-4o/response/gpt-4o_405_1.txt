To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we would typically need prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Since we don't have explicit numerical values for these, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the information at hand.

Given Adam's personality sketch (denoted \( E \)), we have:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's evaluate each field based on this:

### Business Administration:
- A field often associated with leadership, management, and organizational skills.
- Curiosity about nature and empathy for animals are not necessarily strong indicators for this field.
- Problem-solving and high intelligence are assets, but they don't uniquely point towards business administration.

### Computer Science:
- A field heavily reliant on puzzle-solving and abstract thinking.
- High intelligence and a love for solving puzzles are strong indicators.
- Empathy and love for animals are not directly connected but do not detract from suitability.
- Curiosity about nature can be aligned with fields like bioinformatics or computational biology within computer science.

Using Bayes' rule conceptually:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the qualitative match between Adam's traits with typical requirements of each field, the likelihood of him being in computer science seems higher than in business administration.

Here is the qualitative assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values suggest that, given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration. However, these are not absolute probabilities and are intended to reflect the relative likelihood based on the given traits and typical field characteristics.
