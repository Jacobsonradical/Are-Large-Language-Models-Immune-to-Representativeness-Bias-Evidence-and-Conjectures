To apply Bayes' rule for computing the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this scenario:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having that personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of having that personality sketch.

Given we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) or \( P(E) \), we will make qualitative inferences based on the provided information. 

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): A business administration student typically might not strongly match the given personality sketch focused on nature, animals, and abstract concepts.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field for graduate students.
   
   Therefore, we can infer \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low for business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): A computer science student with a strong understanding of abstract concepts and a proclivity for solving puzzles closely matches Adam's personality sketch.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is another common field for graduate students but possibly slightly less common than business administration.
   
   Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is likely higher for computer science compared to business administration.

Considering these qualitative aspects and assuming the priors are equally distributed among all possible fields (which we can't explicitly calculate here), we can suggest:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood ratios based on the qualitative match between Adam's personality sketch and the field characteristics, assuming equal priors. They do not sum to 1 as there are other possible fields Adam might be enrolled in.
