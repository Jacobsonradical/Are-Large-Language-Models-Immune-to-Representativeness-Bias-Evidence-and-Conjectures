To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "business administration" or "computer science," we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will proceed with a qualitative assessment.

Let's break down the provided personality sketch \( E \) and assess it qualitatively in relation to the following fields:

1. **Business administration:**
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants is less typical for a business administration student.
   - A strong empathy and love for animals aren't characteristic traits associated with business administration.
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could apply to business administration but isn't specific to it.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication applies to many fields, including business administration.

2. **Computer science:**
   - Solving puzzles is a common trait among computer science students.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science studies.
   - Curiosity about nature doesn't specifically apply but doesn't exclude the possibility of being in computer science either.
   - Empathy and love for animals aren't strong indicators for computer science but aren't exclusions.

Given this qualitative analysis, Adam seems to fit the profile of a computer science student more closely than a business administration student. Therefore, the posterior probabilities would qualitatively lean towards computer science more than business administration.

Let's provide a reasonable estimate for the probabilities in the qualitative context:

```javascript
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

This reflects that, based on the given personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than in business administration during his graduate studies in 2021. Note that these values are subjective and based on the qualitative match between the personality traits and typical characteristics of students in these fields.
