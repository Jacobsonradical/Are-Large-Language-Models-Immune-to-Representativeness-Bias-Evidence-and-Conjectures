To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "business administration" and "computer science" using Bayes' rule, we need more detailed information, such as prior probabilities of Adam being in these fields and the likelihood of the observed personality traits given these fields. However, we can make some informed estimates based on the given characteristics.

Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), let's analyze the likelihood of Adam being in the specified fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits like high intelligence, understanding of hard work and dedication could suit business administration.
   - However, strong empathy, warm-heartedness, and a love for nature and animals are not typically associated with business administration.
   - Thus, based on the provided profile, it's less likely that Adam is in business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, interest in puzzles, and a quiet nature align well with computer science.
   - Empathy and a love for nature, while not directly related, do not contradict a computer science background and could be seen as neutral or slightly positive, given interdisciplinary interests (e.g., bioinformatics, environmental computing).
   - Therefore, it's more likely that Adam is in computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's suppose the prior probabilities (denoted as \( P(H) \)) for graduate students in general (without specific data) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are somewhat indicative as per common stereotypes and alignment:

Assuming:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- The personality traits observed \( E \) have a higher likelihood given computer science field \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \) as compared to business administration \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \) due to the distinct alignment.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same denominator for both fields and we're comparing relative probabilities, we can use a simplified ratio without needing its value.

Therefore, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are relative measures:

For business administration:

\[ \approx \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{\text{Common denominator}} \]

For computer science:

\[ \approx \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{\text{Common denominator}} \]

Relative probability ratio:

\[ \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})} = \frac{0.18}{0.06} = 3 \]

So, \( P(H|\text{computer science}) \approx 3 \times P(H|\text{business administration}) \).

If we normalize by the sum of these relative likelihoods for simplicity:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) + P(\text{computer science}|E) = 1 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Final approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
