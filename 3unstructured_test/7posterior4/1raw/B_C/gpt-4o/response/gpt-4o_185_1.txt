To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have relevant prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since these values are not provided in the problem, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch \( E \) and common expectations of people in those fields. 

Given Adam's characteristics of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, computer science seems more likely than business administration. Similarly, his strong empathy and love for animals might not be directly related to either field, but his curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work might hold neutral to slight relevance for both fields.

So qualitatively, we'll infer likelihoods considering the general expectations of these graduate fields:

- **Computer Science (CS):** Solving puzzles and high intelligence are strongly associated with CS. An understanding of abstract concepts also aligns well with CS.
- **Business Administration (BA):** This field values empathy and an appreciation for the hard work significant, but it is less connected to solving puzzles.

In the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we can make an educated speculation as follows:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.7 \quad \text{(since he aligns well with CS)} 
\]
\[
P(\text{BA}|E) \approx 0.3 \quad \text{(less alignment compared to CS)}
\]

Here's the formatted output based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These values are speculative and based on subjective reasoning given the personality traits and typical characteristics associated with each field.
