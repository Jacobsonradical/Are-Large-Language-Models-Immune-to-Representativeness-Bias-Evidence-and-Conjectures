To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule for each field given Adam's personality sketch (E), we'll need to consider:

1. The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field of study: P(E|H)
2. The prior probability of each field of study: P(H)
3. The overall probability of Adam’s personality traits: P(E)

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll make some assumptions about the priors and likelihoods, given the information provided in the sketch:

- P(E|H for Computer Science)
- P(E|H for Business Administration)
- P(H for Computer Science)
- P(H for Business Administration)

Let's assume some hypothetical numbers for the priors and likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - P(H for Computer Science) = 0.3 (30% of graduate students might be in computer science)
   - P(E|H for Computer Science) = 0.7 (High likelihood since curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for dedication align well, although empathy and love for nature might not be typical but still possible)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - P(H for Business Administration) = 0.3 (30% might be in business administration)
   - P(E|H for Business Administration) = 0.2 (Lower likelihood since empathy and love for nature are not strong indicators for this field)

The overall probability of Adam’s personality traits, P(E), is a normalization factor that ensures the posterior probabilities sum to 1 over all possible fields, but since we only care about relative probabilities and these two fields, we don't need to calculate it exactly.

Using these hypothetical values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since the probability of Adam having these traits, P(E), is constant and affects both fields equally, we can ignore it for comparative purposes. Now, we just evaluate the numerators:

Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = 0.21 \]

Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = 0.06 \]

Please note that these are illustrative probabilities based on made-up likelihoods and priors for the sake of this example. Actual values would require real-world data and more informed estimations.
