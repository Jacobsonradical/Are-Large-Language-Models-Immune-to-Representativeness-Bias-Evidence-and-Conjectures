To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), and \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \). \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( E \), which acts as a normalizing constant. 

Since we don't have specific numerical values to plug into Bayes' rule directly, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to derive the posterior probabilities.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent with a good understanding of abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits are more indicative of someone pursuing a field that is closely related to nature, puzzles, and empathy (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology) than fields like computer science or business administration. However, let's assess the probabilities for computer science and business administration.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts match well.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns with problem-solving in computer science.
   - A deep love for animals and strong empathy might be less directly related.

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx 0.4 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is important, but it doesn't specifically align with the rest of the traits.
   - Business administration might not be as directly related to his love for nature, plants, animals, puzzles, and abstract problem-solving.

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \approx 0.2 \]

Although we could refine these values with more specific prior information (\( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \)) and more specific conditionals (\( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \)), these rough estimates are based on the qualitative match between the personality traits and the fields.

Therefore, the answer should be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
