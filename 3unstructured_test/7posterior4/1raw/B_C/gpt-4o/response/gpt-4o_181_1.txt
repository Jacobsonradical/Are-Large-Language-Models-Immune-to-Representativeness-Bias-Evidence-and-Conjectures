To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we first need to acknowledge that this requires knowing the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have precise data for these priors and likelihoods, we can make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics linked to each field of specialization.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts suggest a good fit.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving skills in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication can align with business leadership and management roles.
   - Warm heart and communication skills are beneficial.

Given these, let's assume some rough heuristics, bearing in mind that these values are based on reasonable interpretations rather than exact calculations.

- Assuming higher prior probabilities for enrollment in computer science given the increased prevalence of the field in graduate studies. Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science is 0.4 and for business administration is 0.2. The remaining priors would sum to account for other fields, but we focus on these two.

- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) can be interpreted based on the alignment of Adam's personality with the respective field characteristics. Let's assume the likelihood for the matching characteristics for computer science is higher.

Let's put a rough estimate based on these aspects:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Please note these values are illustrative and would need actual data for precise computation.
