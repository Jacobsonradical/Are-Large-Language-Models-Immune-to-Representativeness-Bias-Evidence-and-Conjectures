To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need certain pieces of information that aren't provided in the question, such as the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality traits given the field of study. Since these pieces of information are not explicitly provided, we can make a reasoned estimation based on the personality sketch and the general characteristics of each field of study.

Let’s make some educated guesses:

1. **Computer Science**: People in this field often exhibit strong problem-solving skills, abstract thinking, and are often quiet and introverted. Based on the personality sketch of Adam, traits like high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science.

2. **Business Administration**: This field often requires strong interpersonal skills, leadership, and a more extroverted personality. It is less aligned with the traits observed in Adam, such as quietness and a deep love for animals and nature.

Given these alignments, we can qualitatively reason that:

- The likelihood \( P(E|H=\text{computer science}) \) is relatively high because Adam's traits are well-suited for this field.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H=\text{business administration}) \) is lower because Adam's traits do not match as closely with what is typically expected in that field.

Assuming we have no other prior information about the fields, we will make the simplifying assumption that the prior probabilities \( P(H=\text{computer science}) \) and \( P(H=\text{business administration}) \) are equal, but the likelihood of the personality traits given the field \( P(E|H) \) will drive our posterior estimation.

Accordingly, here are the posterior conditional probabilities based on our qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the alignment of Adam’s personality traits with the typical characteristics needed for success in those fields, rather than exact statistical calculations.
