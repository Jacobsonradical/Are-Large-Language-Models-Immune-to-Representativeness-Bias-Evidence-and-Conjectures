To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \), as well as the prior probabilities of each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

However, in the absence of specific prior probabilities and detailed statistical data, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch of Adam. 

Given Adam's qualities:
- Curiosity about nature and plants 
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles 
- Warm-hearted with a strong empathy 
- Deep love for animals 
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts 
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication 

We can qualitatively assess the likelihoods for Computer Science and Business Administration:

**Computer Science:**
- Strong affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well with the analytical nature of Computer Science.
- High intelligence and problem-solving skills are essential in Computer Science.
- A quieter disposition can align with independent research and programming tasks.

**Business Administration:**
- While high intelligence and dedication are beneficial, Business Administration generally involves significant interaction, teamwork, and leadership, which might not align as strongly with Adam's quiet nature.
- Empathy is an asset in Business but doesn't directly align with other interests like nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.

Based on these observations, here are qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are not derived from precise statistics but rather from a reasoned assessment of the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics needed for each field.
