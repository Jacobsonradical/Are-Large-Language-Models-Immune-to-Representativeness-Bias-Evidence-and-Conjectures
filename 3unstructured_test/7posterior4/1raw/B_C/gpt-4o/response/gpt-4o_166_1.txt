To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and business administration given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll need to apply Bayes' rule. The posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to make a more informed estimate, we ideally would need to know:
1. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): Prior probability of Adam having that personality sketch (which is the same for both fields and thus cancels out when comparing the two).

Without detailed statistical data, we will have to make reasonable estimates based on typical characteristics and the nature of the fields.

### Assumptions and Estimates:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, since curiosity about abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and high intelligence align well with computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, since computer science is a popular field but not exceedingly dominant.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Lower, since the traits such as a love for animals, nature, empathy might not directly correlate with business administration.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, as business administration is also a popular graduate program.

We will assume some plausible values for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) to estimate the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are illustrative and indicate that Adam's personality traits and interests are more aligned with computer science than business administration.
