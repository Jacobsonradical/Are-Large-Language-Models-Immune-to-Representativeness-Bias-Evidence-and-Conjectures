To apply Bayes' rule, we assume a need for some prior probabilities, \( P(H) \), and likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \). Without actual empirical data, I'll make some reasoned assumptions based on typical enrollment figures and the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities** (P(H)):
   - Let’s assume the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science (\( P(\text{computer science}) \)) is generally higher, say 0.20.
   - For business administration (\( P(\text{business administration}) \)), let’s assume a slightly lower probability, say 0.15.

2. **Likelihoods** (P(E|H)):
   - Based on Adam's personality sketch, certain fields may seem more or less likely.
   - For computer science (\( P(E|\text{computer science}) \)):
     - Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
     - Warm-hearted and empathetic individuals are not uncommon in CS, but it's less emphasized.
     - We might give this a likelihood of 0.60.
   - For business administration (\( P(E|\text{business administration}) \)):
     - A strong appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well.
     - Empathy and a love for animals are less relevant.
     - Assigning a likelihood of 0.40 here seems reasonable.

### Bayes' Rule Calculations:

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing different hypotheses, \( P(E) \) remains constant. We will compute the numerators (\( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)) for each field and compare them.

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.60 \times 0.20 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.12 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.40 \times 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.06 \]

Now, in relative terms, we can interpret the probabilities and make them comparable.

### Summary:

- Computer Science: 0.12
- Business Administration: 0.06

Given that the sum does not need to be 1, the relative likelihood of Adam being in one field compared to the other is preserved.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given characteristics, Adam is relatively more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
