To use Bayes’ rule, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that the hypothesis \( H \) is true given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have real statistical data on prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch. 

**Qualitative Assessment:**

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration typically focuses on organizational management, finance, marketing, etc. Adam's traits suggest empathy, respect for hard work, love for nature, and interest in abstract concepts, which are less aligned with the typical focus areas of business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer science often involves solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and sometimes working on technologies related to natural systems or animals. Adam's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and interest in abstract concepts align well with attributes valuable for computer science students.

Given these qualitative assessments:

- For **business administration**, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low due to the lesser alignment of Adam’s traits with the typical attributes of business administration students.
- For **computer science**, \( P(E|H) \) might be higher as Adam's traits align closely with those beneficial for a computer science student.

### Numerical Estimation Based on Qualitative Assessment:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \approx 0.7 \]

### Output in Requested Format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are hypothetical and based on qualitative reasoning rather than empirical data, given the lack of specific statistical information.
