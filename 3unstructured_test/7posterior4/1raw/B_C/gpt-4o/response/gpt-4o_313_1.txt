To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being in computer science or business administration. For the sake of this problem, we will piece together a qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch and how typical the traits might be for each field.

### Qualitative Reasoning:

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are highly aligned with computer science.
- Solving puzzles also suggests skills and interests compatible with computer science.
- Although computer science majors may not typically emphasize empathy and love for animals, the field is vast, and some roles (e.g., working on environmental sustainability or AI ethics) might resonate with these values.

**Business Administration:**
- While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are important, business administration students may more typically exhibit strong interpersonal skills, leadership, and a direct interest in economic and managerial concepts rather than abstract puzzles.
- Empathy could be valuable in business administration, particularly in roles related to human resources or organizational behavior. However, the love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles might be less direct fits here.

Given these qualitative considerations, let's approximate the probabilities:

**Computer Science:**
\[ P(H = \text{CS}|E) \approx 0.6 \]

**Business Administration:**
\[ P(H = \text{BA}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

### Approximate Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These numbers are qualitatively estimated based on how well the personality traits align with each field and should not be taken as exact probabilities without further statistical data.
