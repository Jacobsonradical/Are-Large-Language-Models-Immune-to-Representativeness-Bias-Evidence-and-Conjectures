To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), I can only provide a qualitative analysis. Given Adam's qualities and interests, we can make educated estimations for the likelihood of each field of study.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and interest in solving puzzles align well with traits typically beneficial in computer science. However, there's no direct mention of an interest in computers or programming, which tempers the likelihood somewhat.
   
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate to High
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): This would be a moderate probability because computer science is a common graduate field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication, and warm heart are assets in business administration, especially in areas like human resources or management. However, his strong curiosity about nature and plants might not align as closely with the typical interests of business administration students.
   
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Moderate
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business administration is a common field as well, giving it a moderate prior.

Given these qualitative assessments, the estimated posterior probabilities could be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are based on the given information and reflect the relative fit of Adam's personality traits with each field of study. If we had more specific data on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and prior \( P(H) \), we could refine these estimates further.
