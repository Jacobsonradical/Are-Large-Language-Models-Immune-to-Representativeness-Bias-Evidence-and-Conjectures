To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we follow this formulation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide an educated guess based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in those fields.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Business administration students might appreciate the dedication and hard work but might not typically be characterized by a strong curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, or enjoyment of puzzles.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is a popular graduate field, so it has a moderate prior probability.
   - Based on Adam's characteristics, it seems less probable that he would be a business administration student.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Computer science students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and can appreciate abstract concepts. While not all might have strong empathy or nature curiosity, Adam's traits align well with many typical attributes of computer science students.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular and growing field, which suggests a substantial prior probability.
   - Given the alignment with his personality, Adam being in computer science seems more probable than business administration.

Without exact values, I'll provide a qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values represent rough estimations based on the personality sketch and common characteristics of students in the respective fields.
