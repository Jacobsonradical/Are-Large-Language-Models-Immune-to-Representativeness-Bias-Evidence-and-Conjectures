To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Without specific prior probabilities and likelihood, it's not possible to compute the exact posterior probabilities. However, we can make some educated guesses based on Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics demanded by those fields.

Given Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Computer Science

Factors influencing likelihood:
- Solving puzzles is often associated with computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.

### Business Administration

Factors influencing likelihood:
- Strong empathy and communication skills might align more with roles typically associated with business administration.
- Appreciation for hard work is a general trait that could align with many fields but it's not specifically unique to business administration.

Given the nature-related curiosity and love for animals, Adam might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or similar, but those aren't the options provided here.

### Estimations

Without specific data, the following estimates are subjective:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This estimation reflects that, based on Adam's traits, computer science seems more aligned due to the puzzle-solving and abstract concept understanding, while business administration is less likely due to the absence of strong business-oriented traits. However, note that these are rough estimates and the true probabilities would require more detailed prior and likelihood information.
