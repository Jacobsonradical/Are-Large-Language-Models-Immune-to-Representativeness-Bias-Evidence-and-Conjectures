To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis. Since specific values for priors and likelihoods are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch.

Let's break it down:

1. **Hypotheses (H):** 
   - \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

2. **Evidence (E):**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Quiet, puzzle-solving, warm-hearted, empathetic, loves animals.
   - High intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Given the personality traits and interests:

- **Computer Science:** High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts can be strong indicators for computer science. However, the curiosity about nature and plants is not directly related to computer science but could imply an interest in fields like bioinformatics or environmental computing if those subfields are considered.
  
- **Business Administration:** While high intelligence is also important here, empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work may fit well. However, interests in nature, puzzles, and animals do not directly align with common traits required for business administration studies.

Given the personality sketch, it seems slightly more probable that Adam is in a field that aligns with his intellectual capabilities and possibly his interests in puzzles (problem-solving).

Assuming:
- Prior probability for computer science \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \)
- Prior probability for business administration \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)

Likelihoods could be reasonable guesses as:
- \( P(E | H_1) \approx 0.7 \) for computer science.
- \( P(E | H_2) \approx 0.3 \) for business administration, considering the personality fit isn't perfect for this field.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming the denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for both:

\[ P(H_1 | E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

Normalizing these (so they don't need to add up to 1, but we get a sense of relative probabilities):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.15} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35 + 0.15} = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values represent how more likely Adam fits into computer science based on the given personality sketch compared to business administration.
