To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and business administration given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule. However, we lack specific numerical priors and likelihoods. Therefore, I will provide reasoned estimates based on Adam's characteristics and general stereotypes or common knowledge about these fields.

**Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since we are making estimates, we can assume that \( P(H) \) for each field is somewhat balanced among commonly chosen fields by graduate students, perhaps with some higher likelihood for more popular fields. The personality and interest clues provided (e.g., high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, empathy, love for animals and nature, warm-heartedness) can help estimate \( P(E|H) \).

### Reasoned Estimates:

- **Computer Science:**
  - **High Intelligence and Abstract Concepts:** High relevance to computer science.
  - **Interest in Solving Puzzles:** Strongly relevant.
  - **Empathy and Love for Animals:** Less directly relevant but doesn't exclude the field.
  - **Appreciation for Hard Work:** Relevant.
  - **Overall fit:** High likelihood.

- **Business Administration:**
  - **High Intelligence:** Relevant.
  - **Warm Heart and Empathy:** Positive traits for business, especially in contexts like management or HR.
  - **Appreciation for Hard Work:** Highly relevant.
  - **Interest in Nature and Animals:** Less directly connected to common business scenarios.
  - **Overall fit:** Moderate likelihood.

Given these considerations, the estimates will be:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{"computer science"} &= 0.6, \\
\text{"business administration"} &= 0.3.
\end{align*}
\]

These values reflect that Adam's traits are more closely aligned with typical profiles we might expect in a computer science program but also fit fairly well within a business administration context, albeit less so.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates and should be adjusted if more specific priors or data about Adam's probabilities of enrolling in different fields are available.
