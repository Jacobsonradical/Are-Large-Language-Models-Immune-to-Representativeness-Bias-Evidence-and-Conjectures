To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \), i.e., the probability that Adam is enrolled in that field before considering the personality sketch.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \), essentially the prior probability of the personality sketch regardless of the hypothesis.

However, because we lack specific numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we can only provide qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch.

Let's evaluate \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on qualitative considerations from the description of Adam:

### Business Administration

- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits such as a warm heart, strong empathy, and a love for animals don't explicitly align with the typical traits needed for business administration such as leadership, strategic thinking, and managerial skills. Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles might not be significant indicators for this field.
- **P(H)**: Graduate programs in business administration are relatively common and have a wide variety of students, but there's no strong prior evidence that Adam fits the archetype.

### Computer Science

- **P(E|H)**: The traits such as being good at solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts resonate well with common characteristics of computer science students. Curiosity about nature and appreciation for hard work may also fit, as many computer science projects involve understanding complex systems and dedication.
- **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field with a high number of intelligent students who enjoy problem-solving and abstract thinking, making it a plausible field for Adam.

Based on this qualitative reasoning, we assign higher posterior conditional probability to computer science than business administration, though neither value reaches the maximum possible certainty (1) due to the qualitative nature of our analysis.

Here's the output in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
``` 

These values qualitatively reflect the degree to which the provided personality sketch aligns with the typical traits associated with each field.
