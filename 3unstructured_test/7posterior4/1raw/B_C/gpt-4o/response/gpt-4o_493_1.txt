To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch), using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior probabilities \(P(H)\)**: The probability of being enrolled in a specific field in the population of graduate students.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of having Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: The overall probability of having Adam's personality across all fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since exact numerical values for prior probabilities, the likelihood, and the evidence are not provided, we can make educated guesses based on Adam's personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in each field. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
1. Prior probabilities \(P(H)\)
   - For Business Administration (MBA): 0.25
   - For Computer Science (CS): 0.25
   (These are arbitrary but plausible values for prior probability. The remaining 0.50 accounts for other fields).

2. Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)
   - For Business Administration: Considering that Adam is quiet, empathetic, and loves nature, the likelihood might be low. Let's say 0.1.
   - For Computer Science: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, understands abstract concepts, and is highly intelligent, the likelihood might be higher. Let's say 0.5.

3. Evidence \(P(E)\): This is derived from the overall population characteristics, so we can consider a normalized factor but don't need its exact value for comparative purposes.

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{MBA}) \cdot P(H_{MBA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same in both cases, we can focus on the numerator for comparison and normalization:

For Business Administration:
\[ 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.25 = 0.125 \]

Normalizing these values for a comparative understanding:
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.125 = 0.15 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{MBA}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.15} ≈ 0.167 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.125}{0.15} ≈ 0.833 \]

Here is the formatted answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "computer science": 0.833
}

Note: The exact numeric values may require more detailed statistical information about the population and precise likelihoods. However, this gives a reasonable estimate based on the provided personality sketch.
