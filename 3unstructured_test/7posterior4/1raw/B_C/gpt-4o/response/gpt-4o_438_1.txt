To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have concrete data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we will make reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality sketch and common characteristics of students in each field.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have exact values for these probabilities, we'll make an educated guess based on qualitative analysis.

#### Computer Science
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has a high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- These traits are commonly aligned with the skills required in computer science.
- **Estimated Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \)**: High
- **Estimated Prior \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \)**: Assume a moderate value based on U.S. graduate enrollment in STEM fields.

#### Business Administration
- Adam has strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication, which are useful but not uniquely aligned with characteristics typically associated with a graduate in business administration.
- **Estimated Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \)**: Moderate
- **Estimated Prior \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \)**: Assume a moderate value based on U.S. graduate enrollment in business fields.

Let's make a reasoned estimation:

- **P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})**: 0.7
- **P(H_{\text{computer science}})**: 0.5 (assumed prior)
- **P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})**: 0.3
- **P(H_{\text{business administration}})**: 0.3 (assumed prior)

To simplify calculations, let’s assume \( P(E) \) (total probability of E based on various fields) is normalized and constant.

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

We can combine these under a normalization assumption to compare relative probabilities:

\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3 + \text{(other terms for other fields)} \]

For simplicity and focusing on relative values:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.35 + 0.09 = 0.44 \]

Now the posterior probabilities:

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.44} \approx 0.795 \]

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.44} \approx 0.205 \]

So, the approximate estimates would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.795",
  "business administration": "0.205"
}
```

These values reflect the higher alignment of Adam’s traits with computer science compared to business administration.
