In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**, which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**, the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was in a particular field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**, the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are equally likely for both fields.
- We can make informed estimations about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch.

### Estimating \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it is reasonable to assign a higher likelihood that his personality matches a student in computer science.
2. **Business Administration**: While Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit a business administration student, the strong focus on nature, animals, and puzzles is less typically associated with this field.

### Estimating Values:

Let's assume the likelihoods:
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E| \text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Given equal priors:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

### Evidence \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.5}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.3}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = 0.75 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.1}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration} | E) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
