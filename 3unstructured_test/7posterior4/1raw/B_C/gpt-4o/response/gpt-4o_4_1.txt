To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science and business administration), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

To fill in these probabilities, we would need specific data on:
1. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) — how likely it is that someone in computer science or business administration would exhibit the traits described in the personality sketch.
2. The prior \( P(H) \) — how likely it is that any given graduate student in the U.S. is in those fields.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) — the overall likelihood of someone having Adam's traits regardless of their field of study.

Since we don't have precise data, I'll provide reasonable estimates based on typical assumptions:

- Adam's traits include high intelligence, interest in nature and animals, empathy, and interest in solving puzzles.
- Computer Science students often exhibit high intelligence and problem-solving abilities, but interest in nature and empathy are less stereotypically associated with them.
- Business Administration students may exhibit empathy and a general appreciation for hard work, but less so in the context of nature and animals.

Let's assume some reasonable values for illustration:

- Prior \( P(H) \):
  - Computer Science: 0.20 (20%)
  - Business Administration: 0.20 (20%)

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the traits described:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): 0.30
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): 0.15

- Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \):
  - We estimate \( P(E) \) to account for both fields and assume that Adam's traits are somewhat rare: 0.10

Using Bayes' Rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.20}{0.10} = 0.60\]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.20}{0.10} = 0.30\]

Based on these estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.30
}
```

Please note that these probabilities are rough estimates and intended purely for illustrative purposes. Ideal calculations would require more specific data on the likelihoods and priors.
