To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have that specific numerical data, we can use qualitative assessments based on Adam’s personality sketch.

For Bayes' rule, we use:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- **\(E\)**: Adam's personality sketch.
- **\(H\)**: Hypotheses about Adam's field of study.

We need to evaluate \( P(E|H) \) — the likelihood of Adam’s personality sketch given his field of study — and \( P(H) \) — the prior probability of each field.

### Assessments:

1. **Computer Science**:

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts — traits commonly found in computer science students.
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Computer science is a popular field of study, especially in the U.S., and attracts many students with an analytical and problem-solving mindset.

Based on Adam's traits, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is reasonably high if \( H \) is computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: While business administration might attract empathetic and intelligent individuals, the strong curiosity about nature and solving puzzles aligns less directly with typical business graduate profiles.
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Business administration is also a popular graduate field, but Adam’s specific interests in nature and abstract problem-solving are less commonly tied to this field.

Given Adam’s personality sketch, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively lower if \( H \) is business administration.

Considering these qualitative evaluations, let's assign some reasonable probability values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the matching of Adam's described traits with common profiles of students in these fields. They do not sum to 1 because other possible fields of study are not considered here (e.g., biology, environmental science). The actual posterior probabilities would require specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
