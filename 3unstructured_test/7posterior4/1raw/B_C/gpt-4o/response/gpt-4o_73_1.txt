To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

To calculate these probabilities, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors based on the given personality sketch. 

**Assumptions**:
1. Adam's characteristics:
   - Interest in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication.

2. Fields' alignment with interests:
   - Business administration: Lower likelihood due to its common focus on management, finance, and organizational structures than on nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts.
   - Computer science: Higher likelihood due to the alignment with solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence.

**Priors**:
Let us assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity unless domain-specific prior knowledge is given.

Let us assume:
\[ P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

**Likelihoods**:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low due to misalignment with Adam's interests.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): High due to alignment with Adam's interests.

Let us quantify these likelihoods as follows:
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.8 \]

**Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.5) + (0.8 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.4 = 0.45 \]

**Posterior Probabilities**:

**Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.111 \]

**Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.45} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.889 \]

So, the calculated posterior probabilities are as follows:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "computer science": 0.889
}
```
