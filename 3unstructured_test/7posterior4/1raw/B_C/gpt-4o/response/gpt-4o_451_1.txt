To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) is the same for both fields and not readily available, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field. 

To simplify our calculations, we evaluate \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adamâ€™s characteristics given each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Curiosity about nature and its various plants: Neutral or slight negative correlation as this field does not directly involve nature.
    - Solves puzzles: Positive correlation as computer science often involves problem-solving.
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Positive correlation as these are important traits in this field.
    - Empathy and love for animals: Neutral or slight negative correlation as these traits are not directly emphasized in computer science.
    - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Positive correlation as this is important in any rigorous field.

    Combining these, \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) is somewhat high.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Curiosity about nature and its various plants: Neutral or slight negative correlation as this field does not focus on nature.
    - Solves puzzles: Neutral or slight negative correlation as this field typically focuses more on management.
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Positive correlation since understanding complex systems is valuable in business.
    - Empathy and love for animals: Positive correlation if focusing on corporate social responsibility or related areas, but generally neutral.
    - Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Positive correlation as this is important in any rigorous field.

    Combining these, \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \) is moderate but slightly lower compared to computer science.

Additionally, let's consider \( P(H) \), the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field. Graduate students in computer science are quite common and likely slightly more so than those in business administration given the information.

Let's combine all the factors and do a qualitative estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}

These values represent the likelihood of Adam being in these fields based on his personality sketch and the qualitative information available.
