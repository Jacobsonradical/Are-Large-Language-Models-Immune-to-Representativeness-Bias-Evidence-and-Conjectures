To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a given field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis \( H \) (enrolled in a specific field).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) (the general likelihood of being enrolled in that specific field, considering the student population distribution).
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which acts as a normalizing constant.

Bayes' rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's roughly estimate the probabilities for each field considering Adam's personality sketch. 

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): 
     - Curiosity about nature: Low (Business students may or may not have this trait).
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral to Low (May not be a primary trait in business).
     - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Neutral (May be present, but not dominant).
     - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: High (Necessary for strategic thinking and management, but results in neutral due to mixed traits).
     - Understanding and appreciation of hard work: Neutral to High (Common in motivated individuals, regardless of field).
     An aggregate estimation might result in \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):
     - Curiosity about nature: Neutral to High (Common in analytical and research-oriented individuals).
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: High (A key characteristic of many computer science students).
     - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Neutral (Could be present but not a defining trait).
     - High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: Very High (Essential for computer science).
     - Understanding and appreciation of hard work: High (Common in rigorous fields).
     An aggregate estimation might result in \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7 \).

Considering the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) would significantly determine these values' adjustment and later normalization by \( P(E) \). Since we do not have exact data for the course distribution, we'll focus on \( P(E|H) \) assumptions in the aggregation for simplicity.

Here's the estimated result using the qualitative assessments above:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are simplified qualitative probabilities based on the fit of Adam's personality traits to typical characteristics of students in those fields. Accurate determination would require empirical data on enrollment distributions and personality trait correlations.
