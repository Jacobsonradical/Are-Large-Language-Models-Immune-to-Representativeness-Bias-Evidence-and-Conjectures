To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "computer science" and "business administration" given the personality sketch of Adam (denoted \( E \)), we use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of being in field \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

For this problem, specifically for "computer science" and "business administration," we need to make some educated estimations due to the lack of exact prior probabilities and likelihoods. To do that, we'll consider:

1. **Computer Science**: 
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science students often have strong problem-solving skills (e.g., enjoying puzzles) and high intelligence. However, the traits like strong empathy and a deep love for nature and animals aren't typical indicators for computer science.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Assuming a moderate popularity of the field among graduate students in the U.S.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business administration students may have empathy and appreciation for dedication, but other aspects like curiosity about nature and love for animals are less commonly associated.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Assuming a fairly high popularity of the field among graduate students in the U.S.

For the sake of simplicity, let's use rough estimates for the likelihoods and priors.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \) (Moderate fit with the evidence)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (Lower fit with the evidence)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]

Thus, the estimated posterior probabilities might be similar due to equal numerators, but since we need to scale these values correctly, their ratios are more informative, and we'd revise our approach:

If we assume more elaborative consideration towards nature and animal traits might sway the balance slightly:

Final approximations could be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

This result indicates that Adam's personality traits slightly more align with some aspects pertinent to computer science and potentially some interdisciplinary aspects.
