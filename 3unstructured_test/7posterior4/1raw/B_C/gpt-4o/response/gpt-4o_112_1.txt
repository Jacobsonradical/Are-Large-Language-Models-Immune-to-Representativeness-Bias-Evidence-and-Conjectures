To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we must resort to making qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch of Adam. 

Let's break down the information:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically involves leadership, management, and business strategy skills.
   - May not directly align with Adam's traits like a strong curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and a deep love for animals.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Involves high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and often requires strong problem-solving skills.
   - Aligns well with Adam's traits, especially his propensity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can make the following estimates:

- For **Business Administration**, Adam’s personality traits don’t align closely with what would typically be expected for this field.
- For **Computer Science**, Adam’s traits appear to strongly align with the typical skill set and interests required for this field.

Thus, the conditional probabilities might look like:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimative and based on qualitative analysis rather than quantitative. Given the strong alignment of Adam's traits with computer science, it has a higher posterior probability.
