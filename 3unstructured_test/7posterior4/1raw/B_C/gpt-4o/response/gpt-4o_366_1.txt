To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given hypotheses using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing the personality traits (E) given the field (H) and the prior probability of each hypothesis. 
The Bayes' rule formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact priors and likelihoods, we can only make educated guesses based on the given information.

- For **business administration**, the general population in this field might not strongly align with a deep love for animals, nature, and abstract problem-solving.
- For **computer science**, the traits of enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and appreciation for abstract concepts align well with this field.

### Prior Probability Assumptions
For the sake of this example, let's make simplifying assumptions about the prior probabilities based on general knowledge. These are purely conjectural:

- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \) (representing a moderately low chance)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \) (representing a relatively higher chance in the analytical and abstract domain)

### Likelihood Assumptions
We'll make subjective estimates of the likelihoods based on the personality sketch:

- \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Posterior Probability Calculation
Note, \( P(E) \) would be a normalization factor but since we don't need these to sum to 1, we can skip calculating it for exact proportionality.

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \]

Therefore, in normalized but relative proportionality:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.15
