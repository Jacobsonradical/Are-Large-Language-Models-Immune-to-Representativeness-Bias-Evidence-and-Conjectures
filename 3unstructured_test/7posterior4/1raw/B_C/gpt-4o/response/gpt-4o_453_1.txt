To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we must rely purely on qualitative reasoning to provide a rough estimate of these probabilities.

Let's assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch. 
- Nature curiosity, love for animals, puzzle-solving skills, and high intelligence might be more aligned with computer science due to the abstract thinking required and the potential for environmental and biological applications.
- Business administration might be less related to his specified traits but could still involve strategic thinking and problem-solving.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) due to lack of specific priors \( P(H) \), we can focus on qualitatively comparing \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - High intelligence and good at abstract concepts (highly relevant).
   - Puzzle-solving aligns well with typical computer science activities.
   - Curiosity about nature could be relevant to fields like bioinformatics or environmental modeling.

A qualitative estimate might yield a higher probability than for business administration.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - Empathy and a warm heart can be relevant to leadership but are less directly connected to the day-to-day core study of business administration.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for animals seem less directly applicable.
   - While high intelligence and hard work are universally applicable, they don't align as strongly with Adam's other specific interests.

Given these qualitative assessments, we could assign rough probability ranges to illustrate the relative likelihoods.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on the described alignment between Adam's personality and the typical characteristics associated with each field. The exact values might differ based on additional specific context and information.
