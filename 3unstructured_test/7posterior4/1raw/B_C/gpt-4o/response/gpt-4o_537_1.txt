To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the observed personality traits given each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on prior probabilities and the likelihood of the personality traits for each field, we need to make some educated guesses based on typical associations.

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are quite common among computer science students. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals are less directly related to CS but not irrelevant.
   - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume a moderate prior probability based on the general popularity of the field.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Traits such as a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be quite relevant to business administration. However, traits like curiosity about nature and a love for animals don't strongly align with typical BA characteristics.
   - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Given the general popularity of business administration, we'll assume a moderate prior probability.

Now, we need to make a numerical estimate of these probabilities. Suppose we assign these indicative values based on our analysis:

\[
P(H_{CS}) = 0.4, \quad P(H_{BA}) = 0.3
\]

For the likelihoods:
\[
P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.7, \quad P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.4
\]

To find \( P(E) \), we sum the probabilities over all possible hypotheses (here we simplify by considering only the two):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA}) + \text{(others)}
\]

Approximate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot 0.4) + (0.4 \cdot 0.3) = 0.28 + 0.12 = 0.4
\]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS})P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.4} = 0.7
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA})P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.4} = 0.3
\]

So our final estimate is:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These values are indicative approximations given our assumptions and without detailed empirical data.
