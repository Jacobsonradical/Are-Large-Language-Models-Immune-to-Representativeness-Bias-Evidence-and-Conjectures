To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and will cancel out when comparing the two, we can compare the relative likelihoods by focusing on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Here, \( E \) is the personality sketch, and we have two fields \( H_{\text{business administration}} \) and \( H_{\text{computer science}} \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: Baseline probabilities for each field (prior probabilities). Let's assume these based on commonality in graduate programs.
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.25 \) (since it's a popular field)
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.25 \) (another popular field)

2. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of observing the personality traits and interests given the field.
   - For **business administration**: While empathy and appreciation for hard work are useful, interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as solving puzzles, are less directly relevant. Let's assign a moderate likelihood.
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1
     \]
   - For **computer science**: Curiosity, solving puzzles, high intelligence, abstract concepts, and empathy can be highly relevant. 
     \[
     P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3
     \]

Next, compute:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.25 = 0.075 \]

Although these values are relative and not normalized, they give an appropriate comparison of likelihood.

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are relatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.025,
  "computer science": 0.075
}
```
Note that these numbers are comparative, not absolute probabilities, as you requested. The values illustrate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in a computer science program compared to a business administration program, based on our assumptions.
