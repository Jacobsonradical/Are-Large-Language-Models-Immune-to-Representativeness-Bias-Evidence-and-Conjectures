In order to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information such as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality trait \( E \) given that he was enrolled in that field. Without specific data on these probabilities, we have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, and strong empathy.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

This sketch suggests that Computer Science might be a suitable field for Adam due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature may not align as strongly with Business Administration.

With these qualitative insights, we can make assumptions to estimate the posterior probabilities:

1. For Computer Science:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits in Computer Science.
- Therefore, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science is relatively high, say 0.7.

2. For Business Administration:
- Although he appreciates hard work and dedication, other aspects of his personality don't align as strongly with typical traits required in Business Administration.
- Thus, let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration is relatively low, say 0.3.

Now, without the exact values for the priors \( P(H) \) and the marginal probability \( P(E) \), it's difficult to be precise. However, if we assume equal priors for simplicity (which might not be entirely accurate but will serve for this illustrative purpose), we can then focus on the likelihoods.

Given these assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These are illustrative values based on qualitative reasoning. The actual computation should involve specific prior and likelihood values, which are not provided in the question.
