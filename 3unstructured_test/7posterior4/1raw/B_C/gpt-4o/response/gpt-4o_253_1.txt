In order to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch (E) given each hypothesis (H), and the prior probabilities of each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of H.
- \(P(E)\) is the normalization factor which ensures the probabilities sum up to 1, but since we are considering multiple fields without normalization in this case, it will serve as a proportionality constant.

To estimate these probabilities, let’s analyze the fit of Adam's personality sketch with the fields of computer science and business administration without assigning exact numerical priors or likelihoods.

### Computer Science

1. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_\text{CS})\)**:
   - High intelligence
   - Curiosity about nature (can be relevant but not a defining trait)
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (a strong indicator)
   - Understanding abstract concepts (relevant)
   - Appreciates hard work and dedication (generally applicable)

Considering these points, the likelihood of observing Adam's traits given he's a computer science student is quite high, but not definitive.

### Business Administration

1. **Likelihood \(P(E|H_\text{BA})\)**:
   - High intelligence
   - Curiosity about nature (less relevant)
   - Warm heart, empathy, loves animals (empathy is good for business, but not defining)
   - Understanding abstract concepts (relevant)
   - Appreciates hard work and dedication (important in business)

His traits of empathy and warmth might align with leadership roles, but his love for animals and puzzles doesn’t strongly suggest business administration.

Given the qualitative assessment, the likelihood for computer science seems higher than for business administration.

### Estimating Posterior Probabilities

Without exact numerical values, a qualitative estimation based on the fit:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values represent the higher compatibility of Adam's personality traits with computer science compared to business administration, but the exact numerical values could vary based on more detailed context or data.
