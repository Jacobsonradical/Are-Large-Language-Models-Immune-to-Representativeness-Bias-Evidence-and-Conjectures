To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities P(H) for each field (business administration and computer science), the likelihood P(E|H), and the evidence P(E). However, as we do not have exact numerical values for each of these probabilities, I will provide estimates based on the available personality sketch and common characteristics associated with these fields.

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is constant for both hypotheses, we need to focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
     - Let's assume a moderate value since business administration is a common graduate field.
     - Estimated P(H): 0.2
   
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration.
     - Given Adam's traits (warm heart, empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature), they are not typically strongly associated with business administration.
     - Estimated P(E|H): 0.1

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H):** The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
     - Computer science is another common graduate field, making it a moderate prior probability as well.
     - Estimated P(H): 0.2
   
   - **P(E|H):** The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science.
     - Adam's traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are more closely aligned with computer science.
     - Estimated P(E|H): 0.6

Now we apply these estimates to Bayes' Rule:

### Posterior Probabilities

For **business administration**:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is constant:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is constant:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \]
