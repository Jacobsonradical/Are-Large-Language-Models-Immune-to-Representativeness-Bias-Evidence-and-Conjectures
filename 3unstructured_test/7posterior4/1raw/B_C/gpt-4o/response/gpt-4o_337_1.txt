To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack the specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Therefore, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch.

### Assessing Hypotheses

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typical traits: Strong leadership, strategic thinking, interest in economics, management skills.
   - Adam: Has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.

   Based on the description of Adam, his personality traits align less with typical traits found in Business Administration. While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles seems less aligned with Business Administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Typical traits: Problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, strong mathematical background, interest in technology.
   - Adam: Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.

   Adam's enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with what’s typically expected in the field of Computer Science. However, his love for nature and animals doesn’t directly contradict this field and can be seen as complementary personal interests.

### Posterior Conditional Probability Estimates:

Given the qualitative evaluation, we can estimate the probabilities qualitatively:

- Adam's traits are less aligned with Business Administration.
- Adam's traits are more aligned with Computer Science.

Therefore, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the alignment between Adam's personality and the typical traits needed for each field. Without explicit numerical data, these estimates aim to provide a sense of how well Adam's described personality fits each field.
