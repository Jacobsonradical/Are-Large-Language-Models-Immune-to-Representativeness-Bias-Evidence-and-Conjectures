To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, it's challenging to provide exact numerical probabilities. We'll make reasoned judgments based on the available personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to computer science.
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with problem-solving and algorithmic thinking common in computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy are less direct indicators but can exist in some fields within computer science, such as algorithms for environmental models or AI ethics.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy could be valuable in areas like human resources or management.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with business leadership.
   - However, interest in nature, puzzles, and a quiet disposition might be less indicative of a typical business administration personality.

Given these considerations, we can make an educated guess:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{{computer science}} &: 0.6\\
\text{{business administration}} &: 0.2
\end{aligned}
\]

This reflects a higher probability for computer science based on Adam's described interests and abilities, while not entirely excluding the possibility of business administration due to certain overlapping traits.

Final answers:

  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
