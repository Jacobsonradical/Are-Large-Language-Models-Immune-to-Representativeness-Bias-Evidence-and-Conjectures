To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field, the likelihood of the provided personality sketch given each field, and the evidence which is common across all hypotheses. However, since we do not have the exact numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information in the personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in each field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the priors and exact likelihoods are not provided, the assessments below are based on qualitative reasoning.

### Qualitative Reasoning

- **Business Administration**: Generally, a student in business administration might be expected to show strong leadership qualities, interest in management, economics, and interpersonal skills focused on corporate settings. The personality sketch does not strongly align with these traits. It emphasizes a curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, empathy, intelligence, and abstract thinking. These traits are less directly indicative of a business administration focus, though not entirely exclusive.

- **Computer Science**: Students in computer science often demonstrate strong problem-solving skills, intelligence, and an affinity for abstract concepts. While a strong curiosity about nature and love for animals are not directly related to computer science, the overall attributes like puzzle-solving, empathy (possibly towards software usability), and intelligent, abstract thinking fit well within the realm of computer science students.

### Posterior Probabilities

Given these considerations, we can make educated guesses on the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

In this case:

- For **business administration**, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is lower due to personality traits not strongly aligned with typical business administration students.
- For **computer science**, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is higher due to traits such as intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts being more closely aligned with typical computer science students.

The provided probabilities are qualitative estimates rather than precise calculations. The actual values would require detailed statistical data about typical students in these fields and more specific priors.
