Bayes' rule can be used to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) by combining the prior probability \( P(H) \) with the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). The formula is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have any specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the overall probability \( P(E) \), we can only provide qualitative assessments. Here we will consider the fields of study and the given personality sketch to make an educated guess about the probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**
   - Adam has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles also suggests an affinity for the logical thinking involved in computer science.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of interest in technology or coding which are often strong indicators for this field.

2. **Business Administration**
   - Business Administration requires skills such as strategic thinking, leadership, and a disposition towards organizational and financial operations.
   - While Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, there's no specific indication that he has a particular interest or skills in business or management activities.
   - His strong empathy and love for animals might suggest a more altruistic or research-focused field rather than a profit-driven one.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can make educated guesses about the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This is a hypothetical estimation, considering Adam's cognitive and problem-solving skills align more closely with computer science than business administration, though the lack of specific interest makes these values less than definitive. The probabilities do not sum to 1, acknowledging the possibility of other fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology that could be an even better match for Adam based on his interest in nature and animals.
