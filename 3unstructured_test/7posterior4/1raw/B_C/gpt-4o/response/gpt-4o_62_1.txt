To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of evidence \(E\).

While \(P(H|E)\) can typically be precisely computed if we have the exact values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\), this setup lacks the actual numerical values that are required to conduct precise Bayesian calculations. Instead, we can qualitatively reason which fields are more likely based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's characteristics, we can infer some qualitative likelihoods:
- Strong empathy and warm heart may be less correlated with business administration.
- High intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and an understanding of abstract concepts may be more correlated with computer science.

These observations would lead to:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})\) being relatively low.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\) being relatively higher.

Hence, our qualitative inference can be represented as (without actual quantitative computation):

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality traits and intelligence align more closely with computer science than business administration. However, please note that actual values require numerical priors and likelihoods.
