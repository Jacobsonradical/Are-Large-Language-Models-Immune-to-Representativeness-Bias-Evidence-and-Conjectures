To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \) and the nature of the fields of study.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Assume a moderate prior probability, as computer science is a common field of study.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The sketch mentions high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, the focus on nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Assume a moderate prior probability, as business administration is also a common field of study.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The personality sketch mentions strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication, qualities useful in business administration. However, it lacks emphasis on business-related interests.

Given these qualitative assessments, the probabilities can be subjectively estimated as:

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \) (The abstract concept intelligence is a good fit)
  - \( P(E) \) is common for all hypotheses and will cancel out in relative comparison.

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.25 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (Empathy and appreciation for hard work are a reasonable fit)

Using these estimates, the posterior probabilities can be informally compared.

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
\text{Computer Science: } P(H|E) \propto 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12
\]

\[
\text{Business Administration: } P(H|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075
\]

Converting these to a comparative scale (note this does not sum to 1 and is only a rough estimation):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.075
}
```

This subjective estimation implies that, based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a slightly higher probability of being enrolled in computer science compared to business administration, considering his intellectual curiosity and appreciation for abstract concepts, even though it does not align smoothly with all aspects of this personality sketch.
