To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Probability that a student, without any additional information, is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: Overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the actual data for priors or conditional probabilities, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Here’s some intuitive reasoning for the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, it seems plausible. Therefore, \( P(E| \text{Computer Science}) \) should be moderately high.
2. **Business Administration**: While empathy and appreciation for hard work could fit, Adam’s love for nature, puzzles, and animals doesn't strongly align. This might make \( P(E| \text{Business Administration}) \) somewhat lower.

Let's assume the following for our calculations:

1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.3 \) (Assuming computer science is a popular field among graduate students)
   - \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \) (Assuming business administration is also a common field but slightly less so)

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - \( P(E| \text{Computer Science}) = 0.6 \)
   - \( P(E| \text{Business Administration}) = 0.3 \)

For \( P(E) \), the evidence, we'll approximate it based on the two fields, even though there are others:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E| \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E| \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.3 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.18 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.24 \]

Using Bayes' Rule for both fields:

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E| \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = 0.75 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E| \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.24} \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities considering the provided data:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```
