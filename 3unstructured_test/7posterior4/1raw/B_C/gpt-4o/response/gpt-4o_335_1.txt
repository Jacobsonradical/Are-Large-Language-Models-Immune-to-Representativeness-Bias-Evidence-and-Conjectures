To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

But since we do not have enough data for exact probabilities, we will provide a qualitative estimate based on the given characteristics of Adam and typical requirements, interests, and alignments of these fields of study.

Given the information:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align differently with the fields of computer science and business administration. 

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well with computer science, as it often involves problem-solving skills.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are also critical in computer science.

**Business Administration:**
- Empathy and understanding the hard work and dedication are important traits, as business administration often involves dealing with people and management.

However, Adamâ€™s specific interests in nature, plants, and animals do not strongly align with business administration or pure computer science. Taking these into account, along with our subjective assessment of his traits fitting slightly better with computer science, we can present an estimated qualitative assessment.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Since these values are subjective and based on aligning interests and traits with the fields, it's important to note that actual probabilities would require more detailed statistical and conditional data.
