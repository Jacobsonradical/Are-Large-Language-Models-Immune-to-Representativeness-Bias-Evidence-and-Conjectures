Applying Bayes' rule requires knowledge of several key probabilities:

- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \): The initial probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true before observing the evidence \( E \).
- The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing \( E \) under all hypotheses considered.

Bayes' rule is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we make some reasoned assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**  
2. **Business Administration**

For simplicity, we assume:

- The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits given each field \( P(E|H) \).
  - Computer Science: High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well with this field.
  - Business Administration: Understanding and appreciation for hard work and empathy are relevant.

- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for enrolling in each field (generic graduate student distribution):
  - Computer Science: Assume a 30% probability.
  - Business Administration: Assume a 20% probability.

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields, we focus on the likelihoods and priors:

### Assumptions:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be around 0.7 (high intelligence, problem-solving align well).
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be around 0.5 (empathy, hard work appreciation align moderately).

Let's compute approximate values:

### Computer Science
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.21}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

Given that these values are normalized by \( P(E) \), the relative probabilities can be simplified:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.21,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

While these numbers aren't true posterior probabilities (which require actual \( P(E) \) calculation), they indicate relative likelihood based on the given traits and assumed priors.
