Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability for each hypothesis (H):

Bayes' rule is given by: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch in general.

Given the nature of the question, we have to make some reasonable assumptions. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(H)\) is uniform due to lack of prior information (this assumption won't affect the conditional probability ratios as \(P(E)\) acts as a normalizing constant).

### Computer Science
Evidential compatibility:
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts (positive indicators for Computer Science).
- Curiosity about nature and a love for animals are neutral or slightly less relevant for Computer Science.

### Business Administration
Evidential compatibility:
- Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication (positive indicator for Business Administration).
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and high intelligence could be beneficial in leadership/management but may be less specific compared to the fit with Computer Science.

Given these considerations, our qualitative assessment suggests that the fit for Computer Science is somewhat better than for Business Administration based on the personality sketch.

So, conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \):
- Higher for Computer Science
- Moderate for Business Administration

Normalizing these (they don't have to sum to 1, but should be consistent):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These values are subjective estimations based on qualitative compatibility and the provided information.

If exact priors or more specific human behavioral data were available, these probabilities could be adjusted accordingly.
