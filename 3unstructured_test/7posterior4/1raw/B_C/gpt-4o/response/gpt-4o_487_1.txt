To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis:

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability that a hypothesis is true given the evidence).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the initial probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's total probability under all hypotheses.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the priors and likelihoods. 

1. **Priors (P(H))**:
   - We assume the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in Computer Science (CS) or Business Administration (BA) is equal, unless specific data suggests otherwise.

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**:
   - We need to estimate how likely it is for a student with a given personality sketch to be in each field.

Given Adam's personality traits:

### Computer Science:
- Curious about nature and plants: not directly related.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: positive indicator for CS.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: not direct indicator for CS.
- Deep love for animals: not directly related.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: positive for CS.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: neutral.

### Business Administration:
- Curious about nature and plants: not directly related.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: neutral.
- Warm heart, strong empathy: positive for leadership roles in BA.
- Deep love for animals: possibly positive for ethics and environmental sustainability in BA.
- High intelligence: positive.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work: positive for BA.

Here, letâ€™s make reasonable assumptions for the likelihoods:

- **P(computer science)**: 0.2 (assuming moderate priors)
- **P(business administration)**: 0.05 (assuming low priors)

- **P(E|computer science)**: 0.4 (high fit for puzzle-solving and abstract thinking)
- **P(E|business administration)**: 0.3 (decent fit for empathy, intelligence, and hard work appreciation)

We can then estimate:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For normalization, we should calculate \( P(E) \), but as other fields might contribute, we'll focus on proportional relationships:

### Calculation:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.05 = 0.015 \]

Thus, the unnormalized probabilities are:
- Computer Science: 0.08
- Business Administration: 0.015

In proportional terms:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.015} \approx 0.842 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.08 + 0.015} \approx 0.158 \]

Finally, the probabilities (rounded to 3 decimal places):
