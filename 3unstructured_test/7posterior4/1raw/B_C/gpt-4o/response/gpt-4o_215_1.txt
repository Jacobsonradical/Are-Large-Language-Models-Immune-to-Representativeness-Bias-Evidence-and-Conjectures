To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the initial likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science or business administration graduate fields, given his personality sketch E.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We assume:

- \( P(E|H_c) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_b) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_c) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_b) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of the personality sketch (which is constant for both hypotheses and can be considered in proportion).

Given Adam's characteristics:

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Strong empathy and love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these attributes:

For Computer Science:
- Problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts are strongly aligned with computer science.
- High intelligence is common in this field.
- Curiosity and empathy can also fit but are not as decisive as the above.

For Business Administration:
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
- Empathy and warm heart can be beneficial.

Without specific prior probabilities (like how many graduate students in a given set are in each field), we'll assume equal priors for simplicity.

Next, we qualitatively assess how well the personality fit:

\[ P(E|H_c) \] seems higher because of the fit with problem-solving and abstract thinking (key traits in computer science).

\[ P(E|H_b) \] seems lower but an appreciation for hard work and empathy fit.

To achieve numerically valid probabilities, assume relative propensities:

Let's assume \( P(E | H_c) = 0.6 \) and \( P(E | H_b) = 0.4 \) for probabilities reflecting qualitative aptitudes.
Assuming \( P(H_c) = P(H_b) = 0.5 \) will normalize peer decision to these judgments.

By normalization (\( P(E) \approx P(E|H_c)P(H_c) + P(E|H_b)P(H_b) \)), we use:

So the posterior calculations:
- For computer science:
\[ P(H_c|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.5}{0.6 \times 0.5 + 0.4 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.2} = \frac{0.3}{0.5} = 0.6 \]

- For business administration:
\[ P(H_b|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{0.6 \times 0.5 + 0.4 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4 \]

So the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
This assumes symmetry and simple conclusion-driven point-assessments without deeper field-rate analysis.
