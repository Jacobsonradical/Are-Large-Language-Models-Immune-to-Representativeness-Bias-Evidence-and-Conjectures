Before we proceed with computing the posterior probabilities, it's essential to establish the elements required for Bayes' rule. The rule is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

However, we don't have specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods directly available. Instead, we can make educated guesses based on the personality sketch to provide rough estimates.

Assumptions:
1. **Priors**:
   - P(business administration): Rough estimation of the proportion of graduate students in business administration fields.
   - P(computer science): Rough estimation of the proportion of graduate students in computer science fields.

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - P(E|business administration): Likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is in business administration.
   - P(E|computer science): Likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given he is in computer science.

For the sake of this problem, let's make hypothetical assumptions about priors and likelihoods based on the given personality sketch:

- **Priors** (arbitrary estimations based on graduate student distributions in typical universities):
  - P(business administration) = 0.2
  - P(computer science) = 0.2

- **Likelihoods** (how likely Adam's traits align with these fields):
  - Based on the given character traits:
    - Strong curiosity about nature and plants,
    - Enjoyment of solving puzzles,
    - Strong empathy,
    - High intelligence with abstract concepts,
    - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work.
    
    - P(E|business administration): 
      Business administration might not heavily align with his personality traits. Let’s estimate this as lower than for computer science:
      - P(E|business administration) = 0.1

    - P(E|computer science):
      Computer science aligns more closely with his problem-solving skills, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts:
      - P(E|computer science) = 0.5

The values P(E) can be considered part of normalization constant for simplicity when comparing ratios.

Now, using these supplied values, we apply Bayes' rule proportionally for our two compared fields:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{BA} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since the normalizer \( P(E) \) is common to both, computation gives us ratios:

So:
\[ \frac{ P(H|E)_{CS}}{P(H|E)_{BA}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.5}{0.1} = 5 \]

Hence, P(H|E) for Computer Science is significantly higher.

Let’s nominalize proportional values:

Computer Science aligns more significantly, giving it an edge by factor 5 over Business Administration practically.

So:
{
  "business administration": 0.17 (approx)
  "computer science": 0.83 (approx)
}

Note: These are approximate estimations assuming many arbitrary factors not accounted realistically without specific numeric data.
