To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in the given fields (before considering E).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E | H) \)**: The probability of observing evidence E given that Adam is enrolled in these fields.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the evidence E.

Bayes' rule formula is given by:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E | H) \), and overall \( P(E) \) are not provided, I need to make some reasonable assumptions for these probabilities. Letâ€™s assume the following rough estimates on a scale from 0 to 1:

- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
- **Likelihoods** \( P(E | H) \) based on Adam's personality resembling traits:
  - **Business Administration**:
    - High curiosity about nature and plants (low relevance)
    - Solving puzzles (modest relevance)
    - Warm heart, strong empathy (modest relevance)
    - High intelligence and abstract concepts (modest relevance)
    - Understanding and appreciation for hard work (high relevance)
  - **Computer Science**:
    - High curiosity about nature and plants (low relevance)
    - Solving puzzles (high relevance)
    - Warm heart, strong empathy (low relevance)
    - High intelligence and abstract concepts (high relevance)
    - Understanding and appreciation for hard work (high relevance)

Rough estimates for likelihoods:
  - \( P(E | \text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(E | \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)

Since the exact values of \( P(E) \) are unknown, we'll use it as a constant and focus on proportional comparisons for \( P(H | E) \).

Let's compute the relative probability ratios:

\[
P(\text{business administration} | E) \propto P(E | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science} | E) \propto P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18
\]

Normalizing these for ease of comparison (i.e., let \( P(E) \) factor out):

\[
P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx 0.31
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.18}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx 0.69
\]

Based on these estimates and using Bayes' rule, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.31,
  "computer science": 0.69
}
