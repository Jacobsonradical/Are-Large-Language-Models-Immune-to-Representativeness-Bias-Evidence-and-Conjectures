To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more information such as prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of the personality traits given each field (\( P(E|H) \)). However, we can qualitatively reason about the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and empathy, we should ask ourselves how these attributes are likely to apply to each field.

1. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - Curious about nature and plants: Not typically related to BA.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Could be relevant in strategic decision-making.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Beneficial for roles in human resources or organizational behavior.
   - High intelligence and abstract understanding: Useful for high-level strategic thinking.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant to any field requiring effort and commitment.

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Curious about nature and plants: Somewhat relevant (e.g., bioinformatics, environmental data analysis).
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant as problem-solving is central to CS.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy: Less relevant in a technical sense but valuable in teamwork and user-centered design.
   - High intelligence and abstract understanding: Directly applicable, especially in areas like algorithms, theory, and artificial intelligence.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant to demanding CS projects and research.

Given these qualitative considerations, the interest in puzzles and high intelligence might make computer science more likely than business administration, although the appreciation for dedication could apply to both. We would still need actual statistical data to make precise calculations.

Therefore, based on qualitative assessment alone:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative likelihoods based on Adam's personality traits without specific prior probabilities or likelihoods to perform a full Bayesian update.
