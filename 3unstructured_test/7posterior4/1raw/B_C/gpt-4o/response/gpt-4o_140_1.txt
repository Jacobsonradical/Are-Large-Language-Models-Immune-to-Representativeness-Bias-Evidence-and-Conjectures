To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to quantify \( P(H|E) \) accurately, we need specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Since these exact values are not provided, we'll reason qualitatively about these probabilities to give an informed estimate.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

**Computer Science:**
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with studying computer science.
- High intelligence is typically associated with success in this field.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant in almost any field, including computer science.

However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature and plants are less directly relevant to computer science.

**Business Administration:**
- Business administration typically involves management, leadership, and a strong understanding of human behavior.
- Adamâ€™s empathy and warm-hearted nature would be beneficial in a leadership or HR role.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant but not entirely excluded from this field.

Given these considerations, we can offer reasonable qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates reflect that Adam's traits better align with a field requiring problem-solving and abstract thinking (computer science) than with a field that is more about management and leadership (business administration). However, because both fields value intelligence and dedication, there's some overlap in suitability.
