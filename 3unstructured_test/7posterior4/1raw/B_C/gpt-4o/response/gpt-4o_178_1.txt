To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to evaluate several factors, including the prior probability of each field, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field, and normalizing these probabilities. However, without specific prior probabilities or likelihood data, we can provide a qualitative reasoning to approximate these values.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, let's reason about which field might be a better fit:

1. **Business Administration**: This field focuses on the management, organization, and operation of companies. While it might appeal to some of Adam's intellectual abilities, it doesn't inherently connect to his love for nature, animals, or solving abstract puzzles directly.

2. **Computer Science**: This field heavily involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and sometimes can intersect with studies of nature and artificial intelligence, which could include simulating ecosystems or studying biological processes using computational models. This field seems more aligned with Adam's personality traits and interests.

Based on this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while it is possible for Adam to be in Business Administration (indicating a low but non-negligible probability), Computer Science seems a more likely fit given his personality and interests.
