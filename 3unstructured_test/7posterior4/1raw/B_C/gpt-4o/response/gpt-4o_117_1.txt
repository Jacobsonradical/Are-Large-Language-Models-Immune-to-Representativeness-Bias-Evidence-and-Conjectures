To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) regardless of the hypothesis.

Let's break it down for each field:

### 1. Business Administration

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

Business Administration is a relatively common field of study, but we don't have specific values. Let's assume \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \) (as a rough estimate).

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

Adam's traits, such as curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, empathy, and love for animals, do not strongly align with the stereotypical traits often associated with Business Administration students. However, his intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit.

Let's assume \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.1 \).

#### Evidence \( P(E) \)

This is the probability of the evidence across all fields. Without specific numbers, we could consider it as 1 for normalization.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.02 \]

### 2. Computer Science

#### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

Computer Science is also a relatively common field among graduate students. Let's assume \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \) as well.

#### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

Adam's traits such as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align well with Computer Science. 

Let's assume \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.4 \).

#### Evidence \( P(E) \)

Similar to above, we'll normalize it to 1.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.08 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam being in each field are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

These values are based on estimates and could be refined with more specific data.
