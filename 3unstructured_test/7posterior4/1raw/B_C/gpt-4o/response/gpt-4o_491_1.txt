To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields (business administration and computer science) using Bayes' rule, we would need additional information such as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of Adam's personality sketch given each field. These values are typically derived from empirical data or expert judgment.

Given the sketch about Adam and without specific empirical data, we can apply qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities:

1. Adamâ€™s personality sketch suggests he has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
2. Business Administration typically involves leadership, management, strategic thinking, and often less emphasis on direct interaction with nature or solving abstract puzzles for their own sake.
3. Computer Science typically involves solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and can align with high intelligence and empathy (considering fields like human-computer interaction).

Given this qualitative assessment, Adam seems less likely to be enrolled in Business Administration and more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science. Thus, we can reasonably estimate:

```
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam's traits do not strongly align with the typical characteristics needed for a business administration career, such as strategic management or operational leadership.
- **Computer Science (0.7)**: Adam's love for solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and his intelligence align well with what is often seen in the field of computer science.

These values are qualitative estimates and should ideally be refined with actual data for accuracy.
