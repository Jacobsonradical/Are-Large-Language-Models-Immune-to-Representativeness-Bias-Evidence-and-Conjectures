To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to examine each field and how well Adam's personality sketch matches the typical traits and interests of students in those fields. We need prior probabilities for Adam being in each field, which are not provided, so we will assume them to be equal. We'll simplify the problem by focusing on how strongly the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) suggests each hypothesis.

Given that Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we lack detailed data to compute exact numerical values, I'll use qualitative analysis to assign approximate probabilities based on Adam's interests and characteristics.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business Administration typically requires interest in leadership, financial matters, organizational behavior, and communication skills.
   - Adam is described as having a strong curiosity about nature, a quiet disposition, a love for puzzles, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - The overlap between these traits and business administration is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer Science is a field that often attracts individuals with strong logical reasoning, puzzle-solving skills, and an appreciation for abstract concepts and problem-solving.
   - Adam's personality sketch aligns well with these traits: interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts.

Given these qualitative assessments:
- The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is relatively higher for computer science compared to business administration.
- Assuming equal priors for simplicity (\(P(H)\) is equal for both fields), the posterior probability will more strongly favor computer science.

Using this qualitative reasoning, here's an approximate judgment in probability form:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood (qualitatively) of Adam's personality attributes matching with the field of computer science over business administration.
