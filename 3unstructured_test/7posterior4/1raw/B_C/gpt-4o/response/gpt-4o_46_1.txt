To apply Bayes' rule, we'll use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the sketchy nature of the information and the absence of specific priors (i.e., the base rates of each specialization among graduate students), we will need to use some reasonable assumptions to estimate the probabilities subjectively.

Without concrete numbers, we can make some qualitative assessments based on the information given in the personality sketch and the typical attributes of students in each field.

**Key Points from Personality Sketch (E):**
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
6. Graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

### Business Administration

**P(E|H) for Business Administration:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not typical for this field.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Can be relevant but not specific.
- Warm-hearted and empathetic: Not specific to this field.
- Love for animals: Not relevant.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts: Moderate relevance.
- Appreciation for hard work: Relevant but general.

Overall assessment for P(E|H) for Business Administration is low to moderate.

### Computer Science

**P(E|H) for Computer Science:**
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Not specific but not irrelevant (some computer scientists work in related areas like bioinformatics).
- Enjoys solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
- Warm-hearted and empathetic: Not a typical criterion but not excluded.
- Love for animals: Not directly relevant.
- High intelligence and abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work: Relevant but general.

Overall assessment for P(E|H) for Computer Science is higher due to strong match with problem-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking.

Given these assessments and assuming equal priors for both fields (since specific priors aren't provided), we can assign subjective probabilities based on the qualitative fit.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on qualitative judgment due to lack of specific data regarding prior distributions and other influencing factors.
