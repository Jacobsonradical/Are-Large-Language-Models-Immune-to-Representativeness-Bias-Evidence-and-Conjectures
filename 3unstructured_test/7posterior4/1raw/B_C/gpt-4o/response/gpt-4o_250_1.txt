To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and computer science, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step outline of the computation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field, independent of his personality sketch. For simplicity, we will assume these priors are equally distributed among all possible fields, even though this might not reflect real-world distributions accurately.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, regardless of the field. This can be considered as a normalizing factor, but since we're comparing two hypotheses, we might not need the exact value of \( P(E) \); we can compare the relative likelihoods instead.

Considering the personality sketch provided and our fields of interest:

- **Business Administration**: Typically attracts individuals who are interested in management, finance, and organizational behavior. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work may fit, the quiet nature, curiosity about plants, solving puzzles, and love for animals make this less likely.
- **Computer Science**: This field attracts individuals with high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts, and often involves working with technology which aligns with Adam’s detailed and empathetic nature.

For detailed estimates:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming equal distribution, \( P(H\_CS) = P(H\_BA) = \frac{1}{N} \), where \( N \) is the number of possible fields. Since \( N \) is large, these values are small but equal.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - For \( H\_BA \): Adam matches in intelligence and appreciation for hard work, but less on other traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H\_BA) \approx 0.1 \).
    - For \( H\_CS \): Adam matches many traits (solving puzzles, abstract thinking, intelligence). Let's assume \( P(E|H\_CS) \approx 0.7 \).

3. Given equal priors and focusing on relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H\_BA|E) \propto P(E|H\_BA) \times P(H\_BA) = 0.1 \times \frac{1}{N} \]
\[ P(H\_CS|E) \propto P(E|H\_CS) \times P(H\_CS) = 0.7 \times \frac{1}{N} \]

Since \( N \) is a common factor that cancels out in relative comparison:

\[ \frac{P(H\_CS|E)}{P(H\_BA|E)} = \frac{0.7}{0.1} = 7 \]

Hence, \( P(H\_CS|E) \) is approximately 7 times more likely than \( P(H\_BA|E) \).

While exact probabilities can’t be computed without knowing the precise priors and the full set of possible fields, reasonably:
