To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to consider Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or the exact likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we can reason qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Field: Computer Science

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
   - **High Intelligence**: Common in computer science.
   - **Abstract Concepts**: Fits well with theoretical and programming aspects.
   - **Problem Solving**: Closely aligns with coding and algorithm challenges.
   
   Therefore, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.

2. **Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Computer science is a popular graduate field, which may increase its prior.

Given the strengths in abstract concepts and problem-solving, matched with high intelligence:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.8 \]

### Field: Business Administration

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**:
   - **High Intelligence**: Relevant but not uniquely so.
   - **Problem Solving**: Important, although different focus than in computer science.
   - **Empathy and Interpersonal Skills**: Could be significant for leadership and management roles.

However, the evidence (strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals) aligns less directly with business administration which emphasizes skills and interests likely outside this core:

\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \) is lower compared to computer science.

2. **Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \)**:
   - Business administration is also popular but may appeal to different personality traits and interests than those described.

Overall, considering this mismatch:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

### Summary

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

These are qualitative guesses based on the given personality sketch of Adam and the typical characteristics associated with each field. For more accurate calculations, actual likelihoods and priors would be required.
