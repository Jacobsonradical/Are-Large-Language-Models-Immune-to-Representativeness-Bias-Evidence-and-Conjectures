To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given hypotheses, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific values, let’s hypothesize the likelihoods and prior probabilities based on general knowledge and the provided personality sketch.

### Assigning Prior Probabilities
First, we assign the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both business administration and computer science. 

- We’ll assume a generic base rate for graduate students entering these fields. Suppose 10% of graduate students enroll in business administration and 15% in computer science. This means:
  \[
  P(\text{business administration}) = 0.10
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{computer science}) = 0.15
  \]

### Assigning Likelihoods
Next, we estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

- **Business Administration**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) given Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, empathy, high intelligence, etc.) might not be very high as it doesn't strongly align with typical traits prioritizing business strategies, managerial skills, and human resource skills.
  \[
  P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.02
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is higher because Adam’s high intelligence, problem-solving skills, understanding of abstract concepts, and curiosity align well with what is generally expected in computer science.
  \[
  P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.07
  \]

### Normalizing Factor
The total probability \( P(E) \) can be approximated by considering only the provided hypotheses for simplicity's sake:
\[
P(E) \approx P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})
\]

\[
P(E) \approx (0.02 \times 0.10) + (0.07 \times 0.15) = 0.002 + 0.0105 = 0.0125
\]

### Posterior Probabilities
Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.02 \times 0.10}{0.0125} = \frac{0.002}{0.0125} = 0.16
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
= \frac{0.07 \times 0.15}{0.0125} = \frac{0.0105}{0.0125} = 0.84
\]

### Answer

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.84
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality sketch and general assumptions, he is significantly more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
