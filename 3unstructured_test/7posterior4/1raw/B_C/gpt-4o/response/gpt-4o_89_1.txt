Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities. As a reminder, Bayes' rule is stated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to calculate these probabilities accurately, we would need specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Since these are not provided, I will provide logical estimates based on the personality sketch (E) and typical characteristics associated with graduate fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This reflects the proportion of graduate students in each field. Let's assume them to be equally likely without specific data.
   - \( P(H_{business}) = P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is in a particular field.

#### Business Administration:

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{business}) \)**:
  - High intelligence: This fits generally, but not specifically higher than other fields.
  - Appreciation for hard work: Fits well.
  - Empathy and warm heart: Fits moderately, a bit less aligned with the business stereotype.
  - Nature, plants, animals: Not strongly aligned.
  - Solving puzzles: Not highly indicative.
  
  Hence, let's consider:
  - \( P(E|H_{business}) \) ≈ 0.2

#### Computer Science:

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**:
  - High intelligence: Fits very well.
  - Solving puzzles: Fits very well.
  - Abstract concepts: Fits very well.
  - Nature, plants, animals: Fits somewhat (less aligned, unless considering specialized fields within CS like bioinformatics).
  
  Hence, let's consider:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) ≈ 0.7

### Total Evidence \( P(E) \):
\( P(E) = P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \)

\[ P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 + 0.35 = 0.45 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

1. \( P(H_{business}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} \approx 0.22 \]

2. \( P(H_{CS}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} \approx 0.78 \]

Based on these estimates, the posterior probabilities can be provided as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.22,
  "computer science": 0.78
}
```

Please note these calculations are based on assumed likelihoods and priors due to the absence of specific data.
