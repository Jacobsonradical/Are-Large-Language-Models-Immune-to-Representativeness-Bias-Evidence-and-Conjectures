Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \(P(E|H)\) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis \(P(H)\). This can be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this case, we do not have specific numerical values for the priors or the likelihoods. Instead, we can use qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's interest and skills:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{cs})\)**: Adam's curiosity about nature and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the skills often found in computer science (e.g., problem-solving, logical thinking). Additionally, his enjoyment of solving puzzles is a good fit.
    - **Prior \(P(H_{cs})\)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students in the U.S.
    - **Posterior \(P(H_{cs}|E)\)**: Combining these factors, Adam has a reasonably high probability of being a computer science graduate student.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Likelihood \(P(E|H_{ba})\)**: Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could benefit a career in business administration. However, his specific interests in nature and animals and solving puzzles might not align as strongly with a traditional business administration program.
    - **Prior \(P(H_{ba})\)**: Business administration is another common graduate field.
    - **Posterior \(P(H_{ba}|E)\)**: Considering the mismatch in some of the key interests, Adam has a lower probability of being a business administration graduate student compared to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in computer science compared to business administration, based on his personality sketch.
