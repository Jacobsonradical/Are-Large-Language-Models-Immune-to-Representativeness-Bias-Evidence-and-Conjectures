To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \(H\) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field, and \(E\) is the evidence given by the personality sketch.

While we do not have exact values for the probabilities \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\), we can provide a qualitative assessment of how well the evidence fits the typical attributes of students in each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - The personality traits of being good at solving puzzles and having a high intelligence fit well with computer science, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are crucial.
   - However, appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, along with deep empathy, is less directly relevant but does not exclude the possibility.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration students might also be highly intelligent and understanding of abstract concepts, but the evidence about a strong empathy and love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants seems less typical for this field.
   - Attributes such as understanding the hard work and dedication could fit into business administration.

Given the above qualitative considerations, we might assign the posterior conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are not exact numerical computations but rather qualitative judgments based on the provided personality sketch. The higher probability for computer science reflects a better alignment with the analytical thinking and problem-solving traits of Adam, whereas business administration, while possible, seems to align slightly less well with the specific interests and empathetic traits described.
