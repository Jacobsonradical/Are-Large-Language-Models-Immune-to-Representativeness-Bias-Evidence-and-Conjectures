To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to employ the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the description, let's make some qualitative assessments about \( P(E|H) \) for each field. 

### 1. Computer Science
Nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals do not directly align with typical interests that drive students into computer science. However, traits like high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying puzzles could point towards a computer science affinity. Let's assign a moderately low value for \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \).

### 2. Business Administration
Business administration would generally appeal to individuals who appreciate hard work and dedication. However, the strong empathy and love for animals might indicate other interests. Thus, let's assign a low-to-moderate value for \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \).

Because we don't have concrete base rates (prior probabilities \( P(H) \)) for each hypothesis, we'll assume similar baseline rates for simplicity, letting prior probabilities also marginally influence our decisions.

### Estimates:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \)

If we assume equal priors \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) and normalize across other fields, our outputs can broadly reflect these differences. Without the exact values for normalization, we can qualitatively approximate them. Here are the posterior estimates based on the inputs:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Remember, these probabilities are relative to our assignments of traits fitting hypotheses and assume equal priors (which may not hold in real-world data without further specifics).
