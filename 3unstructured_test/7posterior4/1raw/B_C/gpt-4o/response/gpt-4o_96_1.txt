To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for various fields of study using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior conditional probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

However, exact values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\) are not provided in the question, making precise calculation impossible. Thus, I'll provide a qualitative assessment instead.

Let's evaluate the probabilities based on the description given:

1. **Computer Science**
   - E involves a high intelligence and an interest in puzzles, potentially aligning with computer science.
   - However, strong empathy and a deep love for nature and animals are not key indicators for this field.
   - Genuine curiosity about nature might slightly reduce the fit.

2. **Business Administration**
   - The description highlights empathy and an appreciation for dedication, which may align with certain aspects of business administration.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial, although not exclusive to this field.
   - However, no keen indicators like interest in nature and puzzles align specifically to business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

The values are subjective and may need to be adjusted based on more specific context or data.
