To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to the lack of specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I have to make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch and the characteristics generally associated with each field.

### Step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: You might need to consider the popularity or prevalence of each field among graduate students in the U.S. as a base measure. Generally, computer science and business administration are quite popular.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how likely the personality traits described (E) would be observed in a person enrolled in each field.

3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing those personality traits across the entire population of graduate students, which is commonly tricky to estimate but can be thought of as a normalizing constant.

### Qualitative Assessments:

- **Computer Science**: Traits like high intelligence, curiosity about solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with this field.
- **Business Administration**: Traits like empathy, a warm heart, a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, and dedication might fit here but less so the traits related to abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.

### Hypothetical Computations:

Given no exact figures, I'll make subjective but reasonable qualitative approximations.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,  // high intelligence, puzzle-solving, abstract concepts favor this field.
  "business administration": 0.3  // empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work, but less alignment with abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.
}
```

These values are reasonable qualitative guesses based on the personality traits provided. For a precise calculation, actual data on the distribution and prevalence of these traits among students in each field would be required.
