To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd ideally need specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, without concrete data, we can use qualitative reasoning to approximate the values.

### Step-by-Step Estimation

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We need to consider how common it is for graduate students to enroll in each field. Generally, both computer science and business administration are popular fields but have different appeal factors.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - We need to consider how likely it is for someone with Adam’s described personality traits and interests to be found in each field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This represents the overall probability of Adam's personality, without any specific field, and should be normalized when combining different hypotheses.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his love of animals, intelligence, and capability to understand abstract concepts, he seems more aligned with fields that involve critical thinking and possibly a naturalistic component.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles somewhat align with computer science. However, his empathy, love for animals, and nature might not make it the best fit.

- **Business Administration**:
  - Whereas business administration involves understanding dedication and hard work, Adam's warm heart and empathy, combined with a love of nature, do not seem to be a perfect match.

### Qualitative Estimation

With these considerations, let's make a reasoned estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Explanation
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam's skills in puzzles and intelligence do fit with this field. However, his love for animals and nature isn't a typical characteristic of computer science students.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Adam’s appreciation for hard work is observed in business administration fields, but it doesn't fit well with his empathy, love of nature, and warmth.

The total should not necessarily sum up to 1 as there are other possible fields that might fit Adam much better given his interests (e.g., Environmental Science, Biology, Psychology).

These values are approximations based on the limited qualitative information provided, rather than rigorous quantitative data.
