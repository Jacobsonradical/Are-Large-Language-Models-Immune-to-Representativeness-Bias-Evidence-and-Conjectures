To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since we lack specific data and need to make reasonable assumptions, let's evaluate \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and an assumed \( P(E) \).

### For Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The traits of curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work don't strongly correlate with typical business administration profiles. Business students might focus more on economics, management, financial skills, etc.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business administration is a common field, so we might assume a moderate prior.
- \( P(E) \): Assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for simplicity.

Estimation:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (low)
- \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)

### For Computer Science:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Traits such as solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts strongly correlate with computer science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer science is also a popular field, so we might assume a moderate prior.
- \( P(E) \): Assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for simplicity.

Estimation:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \) (high)
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ rule, assume \( P(E) \) is constant and thus doesn't change the comparative posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]
\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
\]

To summarize:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.14
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration. Note that these probabilities are comparative and not absolute.
