To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Instead, we will qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch, using reasonable assumptions.

For Adam:

1. "computer science": Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts, he might be inclined toward computer science, which often involves such skills.

2. "business administration": Adam's personality traits such as empathy, strong appreciation for hard work, and dedication may also fit well in business administration, where these traits are valuable for management and leadership roles.

Let's estimate the probabilities qualitatively based on these assumptions.

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
- Assuming equal interest in both fields initially.

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- For computer science: Adam's skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly aligned with computer science.
- For business administration: Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work align with qualities appreciated in business administration but might not be as strong an indicator as the skills necessary for computer science.

**Evidence \( P(E) \):**
- The probability that someone with Adam's interests and traits exists.

### Estimations:

#### Computer Science:
- High likelihood due to alignment with abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.
  
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.8 \]

#### Business Administration:
- Moderate likelihood due to soft skills aligning but not heavily indicating business administration.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Assumed Prior Probabilities:
- Prior for computer science and business administration \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) each.
- Evidence probability \( P(E) \) is considered constant for normalization.

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:
- Rough estimation since actual data is not available.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.8 * 0.5 / P(E)",
  "business administration": "0.5 * 0.5 / P(E)"
}
```

To normalize, we compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.25 = 0.65 \]

Thus,

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4 / 0.65 ≈ 0.615",
  "business administration": "0.25 / 0.65 ≈ 0.385"
}
```

Therefore, the final estimations are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.615,
  "business administration": 0.385
}
```
