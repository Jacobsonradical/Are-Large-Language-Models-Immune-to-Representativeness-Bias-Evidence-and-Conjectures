To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to have both the prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis P(E|H). However, we don't have specific data, so we'll make reasoned estimates based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge about the fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The priors P(H) can be considered as the general distribution of graduate students in each field. Without specific data, we might assume these to be relatively even but this will be an estimate based on typical U.S. graduate school distributions.

For the likelihoods P(E|H), we consider how well Adam's personality sketch matches typical personality traits found in each field.

### Estimating Likelihood:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good abstract understanding. These traits are well-aligned with computer science, where problem-solving and abstract thinking are essential skills.

2. **Business Administration**: While business administration also values high intelligence, it is not as closely associated with puzzle-solving or a deep love for nature and empathy towards animals. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit, but less so compared to Computer Science.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

- \[ P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \] could be higher because puzzle-solving, intelligence, and abstract thinking are strongly matched traits.
- \[ P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \] might be lower compared to Computer Science for the reasons mentioned.

### Prior Probabilities (Estimates):

Assume \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.2 \) and \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.2 \), acknowledging the remaining probability for other fields. These are rough estimates for the sake of calculation.

### Likelihood Estimates for P(E|H):

Let's assign likelihood values based on how well each field matches the personality traits:

- \( P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

We won’t calculate the marginal probability \( P(E) \) because we are providing relative likelihoods, not absolute.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Using Bayes’ rule (excluding \( P(E) \) for relative comparison):
- \[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \propto P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]
- \[ P(\text{Business Administration} | E) \propto P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Therefore, normalizing relatively:

\[
\{
  "computer science": \frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.04} = \frac{0.14}{0.18} \approx 0.78,
  "business administration": \frac{0.04}{0.14 + 0.04} = \frac{0.04}{0.18} \approx 0.22
\}
\]

So, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

\[
\{
  "computer science": 0.78,
  "business administration": 0.22
\}
\]

This reflects the higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in computer science based on the given personality sketch.
