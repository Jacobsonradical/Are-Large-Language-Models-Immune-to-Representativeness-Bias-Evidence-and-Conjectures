To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express it in terms of the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific values for these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative assessment to estimate the posterior probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular graduate field.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science. The fields of puzzles and abstract thinking are highly pertinent here.
   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Moderate to high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Business Administration is also a significant and common graduate field.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): While Adamâ€™s empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit within business administration, the focus on nature, animals, and abstract concepts is less related.
   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Low to moderate.

Using these qualitative assessments, let's provide the estimated values for posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the demands or nature of the respective fields.
