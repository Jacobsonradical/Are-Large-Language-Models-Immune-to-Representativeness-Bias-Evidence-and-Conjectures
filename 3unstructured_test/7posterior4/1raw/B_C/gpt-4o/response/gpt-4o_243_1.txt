To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

- \( P(H|E) \): the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for each of these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative reasoning to estimate the probabilities. 

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. Considering these traits:

- For **Computer Science**:
  Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with fields that require analytical and problem-solving skills, such as computer science. Additionally, his interest in puzzles correlates with the problem-solving aspects of programming and algorithms.

  Therefore, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.

- For **Business Administration**:
  While a deep love for animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work could be beneficial, they do not specifically align with typical business administration themes, which might focus more on management, finance, strategy, etc. Additionally, Adam's curiosity about nature and plants is less relevant to this field.

  Therefore, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is relatively lower compared to computer science.

Without specific demographic priors \( P(H) \) or the exact model for \( P(E) \), we make qualitative estimates:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.75 \text{ (High likelihood due to traits aligning well with CS)}
\]

\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.20 \text{ (Lower likelihood as traits do not strongly align)}
\]

Hence, the resulting estimates in the required format would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

These probabilities are rough estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than exact calculations due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and datasets.
