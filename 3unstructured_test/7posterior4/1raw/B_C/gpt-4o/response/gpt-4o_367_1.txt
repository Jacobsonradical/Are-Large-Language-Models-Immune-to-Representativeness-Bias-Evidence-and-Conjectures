To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would need several pieces of information such as the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (computer science and business administration), and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given his enrollment in each of those fields. 

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited information available, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with each field and provide rough estimates.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): High. Intelligence, abstract concept understanding, puzzle-solving, and empathy (a consideration in user-centered design and ethical AI) are relevant.
   - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): Moderate. Computer Science is a popular graduate field.
   
   Assumption: High match, so let's say \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Moderate to Low. Business often emphasizes different skills such as leadership, strategic thinking, and sometimes less focus on empathy and nature-related curiosity.
   - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Moderate. Business Administration is another common graduate field.
   
   Assumption: Moderate to average match, so let's say \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \).

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can roughly estimate the posterior probabilities based on the likelihoods assuming uniform priors.

Given these assumptions and normalizing:

Let's denote the likelihood for computer science as \( 0.6 \) and for business administration as \( 0.3 \). Normalize them:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.3} = \frac{0.6}{0.9} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.3}{0.6 + 0.3} = \frac{0.3}{0.9} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

So the approximate posterior conditional probabilities will be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

These values are estimates based on the personality sketch and typical field characteristics. For exact probabilities, more specific data and priors would be necessary.
