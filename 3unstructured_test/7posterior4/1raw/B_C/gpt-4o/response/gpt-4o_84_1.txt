To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field (e.g., computer science or business administration) given his personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in field H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch E occurring.

Assume that we lack specific numerical probabilities for each field. Instead, we rely on interpreting the information given in the personality sketch E to estimate the conditional probabilities qualitatively.

Let's analyze each field based on the given personality sketch:

### Computer Science
- Skills in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science.
- High intelligence aligns well with the demands of computer science studies.

Given the strong correlation between these characteristics and typical traits of computer science students:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \] is reasonably high.

### Business Administration
- A warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might not be as directly relevant to business administration.
- While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are valuable in any graduate field, they do not uniquely highlight business administration.

Considering that the sketch aligns less directly with the typical attributes of business administration students:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \] would be relatively lower.

Given that specific numerical priors are not provided, we will manage with qualitative assessments.

Here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the interpretation of the personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in those fields.
