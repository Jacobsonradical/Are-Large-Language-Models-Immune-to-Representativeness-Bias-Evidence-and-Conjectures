To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, as well as the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this context, we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities. Instead, we will make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch and infer approximate likelihoods.

### Breaking down the assessment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a love for animals do not strongly align with the typical traits expected in business administration.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are applicable, but the subject’s interests in nature and animals are less so.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts are key traits for someone likely to excel in computer science.
   - While empathy and a love for animals are less relevant, they do not contradict a propensity for computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can infer relative likelihoods and thus approximate posteriors:

### Qualitative Inference:

- Adam’s traits have a higher match with computer science than business administration. He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are highly relevant for computer science.
- Adam's empathy and nature-curiosity traits do not significantly overlap with business administration.

Therefore, here are the qualitatively assessed probabilities for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These are not exact figures but are inferred from the fit between Adam’s personality and the respective fields' typical demands and traits.
