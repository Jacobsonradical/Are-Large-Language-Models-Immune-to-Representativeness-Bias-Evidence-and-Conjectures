In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given that the student is enrolled in that field), we have to provide a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's consider how these traits correlate with the fields in question:

1. **Computer Science:** The fields of computer science often attract individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. High intelligence is also a common trait, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication is typically required given the complexity of the field. Empathy is not strictly related to the discipline, but it can play a role in team collaboration and developing user-friendly technologies.

2. **Business Administration:** This field often requires strong empathy for dealing with people and understanding market needs. However, a deep love for animals and plants might be less relevant. Appreciation for hard work and dedication is important, but a focus on abstract problem-solving and puzzles might not be as central as it is in computer science.

Given these considerations, we can make an informed but non-numerical estimation:

{
  "computer science": "higher likelihood, approximately between 0.6 to 0.8",
  "business administration": "lower likelihood, approximately between 0.2 to 0.4"
}

Note that these values are qualitative assessments based on the described traits and discipline requirements rather than precise calculations. Each number reflects the perceived alignment of Adam's personality with the typical demands and culture of each field.
