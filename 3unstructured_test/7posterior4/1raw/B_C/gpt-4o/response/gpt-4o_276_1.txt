To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality traits given enrollment in each field. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the given information about Adam.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the priors \( P(H) \) are equal for all fields of graduate specialization. This means \( P(H) \) does not contribute to differentiating between fields here. Therefore, we focus on \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's traits given enrollment in a specific field.

Given the personality sketch that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work, we can infer the following likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - Solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with CS.
   - Abstract thinking aligns with computer algorithms and abstract concepts in CS.
   - Curiosity can apply but less direct connection to nature.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - Appreciation for hard work aligns with BA.
   - Strong empathy might also align with leadership roles in BA.
   - However, less direct alignment with solving puzzles or love for animals and nature.

Matching these inferences to the personality traits, we can assign higher likelihood values to the traits that align more closely with characteristics of typical student profiles in those fields.

We assume:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)

Normalize by the total evidence \( P(E) \):

1. Computer Science \( P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.7}{0.7 + 0.3} = \frac{0.7}{1} = 0.7 \)
2. Business Administration \( P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.3}{0.7 + 0.3} = \frac{0.3}{1} = 0.3 \)

Based on these likelihoods:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
