To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the limited information, we cannot calculate precise numerical values for \( P(H|E) \) without making some assumptions about the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. However, we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch.

Assumptions:
1. Adam's characteristics fit well with fields that value curiosity, intelligence, and empathy.
2. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) could be considered equally likely for simplicity unless we have specific data.

Qualitative Assessment:
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence, love for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a strong fit for computer science.
- **Business Administration**: While his empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the specific traits mentioned do not strongly align with common profiles in business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can loosely estimate the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in computer science based on the fit between his personality traits and the typical characteristics of successful computer science students. The lower value for business administration reflects a less direct alignment with the personality sketch, though by no means ruling it out.
