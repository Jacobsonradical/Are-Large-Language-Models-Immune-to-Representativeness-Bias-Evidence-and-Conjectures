To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis (P(H)), which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field of study before considering the personality sketch.
2. The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis (P(E|H)), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack specific values for each of these probabilities (P(E|H), P(H), and P(E)), we can only make an informed estimate based on the given personality sketch and general trends. 

### Prior Probabilities:
In the absence of specific data for the general popularity or enrollment statistics:
- Assume equal prior probabilities for simplifying purposes. Let's assume an equal chance of 0.5 for both fields.

### Likelihoods:
To estimate P(E|H) - how likely the personality description fits each field:
- **Computer Science (CS)**:
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: slightly neutral/less relevant.
  - Enjoyment of puzzles: highly relevant.
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: less typical but possible.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: highly relevant.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant across fields; slightly positively biased.

  Overall: Moderately likely.

- **Business Administration (BA)**:
  - Curiosity about nature and plants: less relevant.
  - Enjoyment of puzzles: slightly less relevant (not typically associated directly).
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: could be somewhat relevant for fields like HR, but generally less typical.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: relevant but less emphasized than in CS.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: relevant across fields.

  Overall: Less likely compared to CS.

Based on this qualitative assessment:
- Assign a higher likelihood to the traits in relation to CS over BA.

Estimating (in the absence of exact data):
- Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 0.7 (CS) to 0.3 (BA) for these traits.

Updating our priors based on these likelihoods:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{ (0.7 \times 0.5) + (0.3 \times 0.5) } = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.35}{0.50} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(BA|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{ (0.7 \times 0.5) + (0.3 \times 0.5) } = \frac{0.15}{0.35 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.50} = 0.3 \]

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note that this is a simplified estimation based on the qualitative alignment of the personality traits with likely fields of enrollment. Real data could significantly alter these probabilities.
