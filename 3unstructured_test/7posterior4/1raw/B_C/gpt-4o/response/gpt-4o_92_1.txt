To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, before considering the evidence \( E \).
2. **Compute the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
3. **Compute the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \) across all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's go through these steps for each field:

### Preliminary Assumptions:
Since the problem didn't provide specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, I will make some reasonable assumptions based on the description.

- **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)** for each field:
  - Computer Science: Let’s assume 0.3 (since many students are in this popular field).
  - Business Administration: Let’s assume 0.2 (less common for someone with Adam's interests compared to computer science but still significant).
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - Computer Science: Considering Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking skills, plus his enjoyment of puzzles, the likelihood is reasonably high. Let's assume 0.6.
  - Business Administration: Given Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication, but less direct evidence connecting his personality to business studies, we'll assume this likelihood is moderate. Let’s assume 0.3.

- **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: As this is a normalizing constant, it ensures that the probabilities sum up correctly. However, since we're interested in relative comparisons, we don't need to compute an exact value of \( P(E) \).

### Bayes' Rule Application
For simplicity, let’s assume that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields.

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities:

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

### Normalizing:
Since \(\frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}\) and \(\frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}\) are both divided by \( P(E) \), the relative posterior probabilities will be:

- Computer Science: \( 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \)

The exact posterior conditional probabilities normalized would then be (after dividing by the sum):

- Sum of numerators \( 0.18 + 0.06 = 0.24 \)
- Computer Science probability \( \frac{0.18}{0.24} \approx 0.75 \)
- Business Administration probability \( \frac{0.06}{0.24} \approx 0.25 \)

So our final approximations are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

Note that these are relative probabilities and assume the priors and likelihoods as stated above. Adjustments to these assumptions could change the final values.
