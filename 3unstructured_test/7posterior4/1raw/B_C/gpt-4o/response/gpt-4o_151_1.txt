To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), which are the initial probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch \( E \). However, since we don't have the exact prior probabilities, let's assume a uniform prior for simplicity. This means we will proceed with the assumption that it is equally likely for Adam to have enrolled in any given field before considering his personality traits.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(H) \) is the same for each field, we can simplify the relative comparison between the fields by examining \( P(E|H) \), which is the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.

For each field, we need to determine how likely Adam's personality traits \( E \) would be if he were enrolled in that field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy for hard work are highly relevant to computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While empathy, appreciation for hard work, and high intelligence are relevant, traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoying solving puzzles are somewhat less directly aligned with business administration.
   - Therefore, \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \) might be lower compared to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments and assuming the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are equal, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are an estimation based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field, assuming equal priors. The actual probabilities would depend on more specific data regarding prior likelihoods and trait relevance distributions for each field.
