To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we would typically need specific statistical data such as the prior probabilities of students enrolling in each field and the likelihood of each field given the personality sketch \( E \). Given that we do not have such data, I will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

### Qualitative Reasoning

- **Business Administration**:
  - The personality traits listed (genuine curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, love for animals, empathy) are not strongly aligned with the typical traits associated with Business Administration, which might focus more on leadership, strategic thinking, and financial analysis.
  - Hence, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is relatively low.

- **Computer Science**:
  - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles are strongly aligned with the traits needed for Computer Science.
  - Hence, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.

Given these qualitative evaluations, we can assign heuristic probabilities to reflect the alignment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the better match of the personality traits in the sketch with the field of Computer Science compared to Business Administration.
