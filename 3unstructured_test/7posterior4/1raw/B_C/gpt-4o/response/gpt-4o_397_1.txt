To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability of being enrolled in each field before observing the evidence.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our calculations, we will make some assumptions about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch and a rough approximation of the priors \( P(H) \). Note that without detailed statistical data, these probabilities must be estimated qualitatively.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: There are many graduate computer science students, so we might consider it somewhat common (let's assume a moderate prior, say 0.2).
   - **P(E|H)**: High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, but a deep love for animals and nature might not directly correlate (assume medium likelihood, 0.5).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(H)**: Also a common field, so similar prior to computer science (assume 0.2).
   - **P(E|H)**: The personality traits (empathy, love for animals, nature curiosity) do not strongly fit business administration, except for appreciation of hard work and dedication (assume lower likelihood, 0.2).

Without precise values for \( P(E) \), we'll focus on the relative likelihoods. Since the priors are the same, the posterior will be directly proportional to the likelihoods.

Let's calculate approximate relative posteriors:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \)
}

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields (it's the same evidence considered), we look at the numerators for relative comparison:

Therefore, the approximate relative probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

(Note that these values are normalized for relative comparison and not absolute probabilities.)

To represent them as conditional probabilities, normalize by the sum of the numerators:

Total = 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.5}{0.7} \approx 0.71 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2}{0.7} \approx 0.29 \)
}
Thus, the conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.71,
  "business administration": 0.29
}
