To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must take into consideration several factors. Bayes' rule is generally given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

To compute these probabilities, we need appropriate prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since we don’t have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll reason qualitatively based on the information provided and typical distributions for graduate students in different fields.

### Reasoning for Likelihoods and Priors

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on Adam's personality sketch:
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants** might slightly favor fields like Biology, Environmental Science, or similar.
   - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles** might be indicative of a good fit for fields involving problem-solving, such as Computer Science or Mathematics.
   - **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals** might slightly favor fields like Veterinary Science, Psychology, or even related life sciences.
   - **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts** are often beneficial in fields like Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or Physics.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication** is generally a positive trait across many fields but may not significantly differentiate these fields.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Graduate enrollment figures:
   - Computer Science is a highly popular graduate field with increasing enrollment rates.
   - Business Administration is also a highly enrolled field but generally attracts different personality traits, like leadership and business acumen which are not strongly indicated in his sketch.

Given that we don't have specific numerical probabilities, I'll use informed estimations based on relative fit to Adam’s personality traits.

### Calculation and Estimation

Based on the qualitative assessment, I would assign the following posterior probability estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This is based on the reasoning that Computer Science fits better into the puzzle-solving and abstract thinking traits, whereas Business Administration doesn’t align strongly with Adam's described personality traits.
