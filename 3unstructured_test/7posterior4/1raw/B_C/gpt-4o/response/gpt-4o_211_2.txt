To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need three components:
1. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): Marginal likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the hypothesis.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have precise values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \). We can use qualitative reasoning to approximate the relative probabilities.

### Qualitative Assessment:

#### Computer Science
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, and his love for animals, seem more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or wildlife conservation rather than computer science.
- His intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts do align with computer science.
- Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate.
- Probability \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to high because computer science is a common graduate field.
  
#### Business Administration
- Adam's empathy, warm heart, and love for animals do not strongly align with the typical skill set emphasized in business administration.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit business administration.
- Probability \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low.
- Probability \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): Moderate, as business administration is also a common graduate field.

Given the qualitative reasoning, we can assume:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) might be somewhat higher than \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \), and \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) might also be a bit higher than \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \).

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can provide a rough estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's traits align more closely (but not perfectly) with computer science than with business administration.
