In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given each field of study, as well as the prior probabilities of each field of study. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we will need to make some assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

1. **Computer Science**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are less directly relevant but not contradictory.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderate to high.

2. **Business Administration**
   - Empathy and appreciation for dedication are relevant.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant, especially in higher-level strategic roles.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly relevant and may dilute the likelihood.

Considering the typical characteristics:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) > P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \]

Here are the posterior probabilities with assumed priors:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are illustrative and based on the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods. To get precise probabilistic values, actual data on enrollments and likelihoods would be necessary.
