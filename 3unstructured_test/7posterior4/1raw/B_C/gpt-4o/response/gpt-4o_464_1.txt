To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) given those fields, and then normalize accordingly. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H_i \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the evidence (personality sketch of Adam).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence across all possible fields (which acts as a normalizing constant).

Since the problem does not provide specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) directly, I'll make reasonable contextual assumptions based on Adam's personality traits and typical graduate field distributions. 

Let's analyze Adam's characteristics in the context of the given fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Traits alignment: While empathy and understanding of hard work might fit, parts like a love for nature, animals, and enjoyment of solving puzzles aren't usually central to business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Traits alignment: High intelligence, abstract thinking, curiosity, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the traits of a computer science student. 

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity, we give relative weights to the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \):
    - Empathy and understanding of hard work are decent matches, but the fit is not strong for the full profile. Suppose \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \).

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
    - High alignment with intelligence, abstract thinking, curiosity about nature, empathy (as it can relate to collaborative work and ethical AI), etc. Suppose \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.8 \).

Letâ€™s normalize over these two fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]

Assuming equal prior probabilities (\( P(H) = 0.5 \)):

\[
P(E) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5
\]

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
