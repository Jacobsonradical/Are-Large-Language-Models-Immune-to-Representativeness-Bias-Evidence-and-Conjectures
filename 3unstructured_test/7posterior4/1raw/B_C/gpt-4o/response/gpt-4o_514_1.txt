To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes’ rule, we would ideally need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of study, as well as the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) - the probabilities of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in each field. Without specific numeric values for these priors and likelihoods, we can only offer a qualitative assessment which intuitively considers how well the personality sketch matches typical profiles for each field.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), he appears to be inquisitive about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, loves animals, and understands abstract concepts well. These traits match certain fields better than others based on general profiles.

Here’s the qualitative assessment for each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Traits such as a warm heart and strong empathy could be beneficial in business administration, especially in human resources or organizational behavior.
    - However, curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and the enjoyment of solving puzzles don't predominantly align with business administration.
    - Knowledge and appreciation for hard work and dedication do apply broadly to many fields, including business administration.
    - Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be relevant but may not align as strongly compared to other fields.
    - Overall Match: Moderate to Low

2. **Computer Science**:
    - Enjoys solving puzzles directly aligns with computer science, as the field often involves problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
    - High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science.
    - Curiosity about nature and plants might suggest potential interest in computational biology or bioinformatics within computer science.
    - Love for animals and strong empathy are less directly relevant but do not rule out the field, suggesting a strong match for someone interested in applications of computer science in environmental or life sciences.
    - Overall Match: High

Given these qualitative assessments, we can offer the following posterior conditional probabilities as educated guesses:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These numbers are not definitive and should be refined with actual prior and likelihood data if available.
