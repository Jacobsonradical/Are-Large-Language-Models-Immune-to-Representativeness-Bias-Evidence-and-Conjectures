To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since this information is not explicitly provided, we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the descriptions given.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{BA}) \) = prior probability of being enrolled in business administration
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) = prior probability of being enrolled in computer science
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) = likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) = likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in computer science
- \( P(E) \) = overall probability of having the personality sketch \( E \)

Assume that the priors for both fields are equal for simplicity, though this may not be true in reality:

\[ P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) = 0.5 \]

Next, evaluate the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, solving puzzles) do not strongly align with a typical business administration focus, so letâ€™s assign a lower value, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): These traits (intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles) align somewhat with computer science, so we assign a higher value, but still moderate due to lack of direct evidence, say 0.3.

Since we are only comparing the relative probabilities for these two fields, we can omit \( P(E) \) because it would be the same for both calculations.

Now applying Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = k \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = k \cdot 0.15 \]

Where \( k \) is a normalizing factor.

Since we are comparing the two fields, we can normalize the probabilities by dividing each by their sum:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.15} = \frac{0.05}{0.20} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.05 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.20} = 0.75 \]

Thus, our final posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
```
