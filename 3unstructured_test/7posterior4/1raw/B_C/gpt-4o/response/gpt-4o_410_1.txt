To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need the following information or assumptions:

1. Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field: This is the general probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in a given field.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability that Adam's personality and background \( E \) would be observed given that he is in that field.
3. Normalizing constant \( P(E) \): This is the total probability of observing Adam's personality and background \( E \) over all fields.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities and detailed likelihood information, we'll have to make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch \( E \):

- For **business administration**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, quiet disposition, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood might be lower since these traits align more closely with fields involving analytical and theoretical work related to nature and abstract concepts, rather than typical business scenarios.

- For **computer science**: Given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, understands abstract concepts, and has a warm heart and empathy (potentially useful in designing user-centric software or AI), the likelihood may be relatively higher.

Let’s make some assumptions:

1. \( P(H_{\text{business admin}}) = 0.1 \)
2. \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 \)

These assume business administration and computer science have different enrollments. 
For the sake of this exercise, we adjust these based on Adam’s traits:

1. \( P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \) = 0.05: These personality traits are less typical for business administration.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) = 0.2: These personality traits are more in line with computer science.

Normalizing constant \( P(E) \) for simplicity can be assumed as the sum: 
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]

Let's calculate:
\[ P(E) \approx (0.05 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.005 + 0.03 = 0.035 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business admin}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.035} \approx 0.143 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.035} \approx 0.857 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.857
}
```

These computations are based on assumed priors and imagined likelihoods which align with the described personality. Real values would need actual prior and likelihood data.
