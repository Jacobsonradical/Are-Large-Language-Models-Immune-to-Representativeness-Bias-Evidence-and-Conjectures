To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \), we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

However, since we don't have the exact numbers, we can make some qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities based on the descriptions.

### Business Administration:
- **Prior Probability \( (P(H)) \)**: A fair number of graduate students might be in business administration.
- **Likelihood \( (P(E|H)) \)**: Business administration typically involves strong interpersonal skills, business acumen, and might not typically focus directly on nature, puzzles, or animals. Thus, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) might be lower.

### Computer Science:
- **Prior Probability \( (P(H)) \)**: There are many graduate students in computer science.
- **Likelihood \( (P(E|H)) \)**: Computer science often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with Adamâ€™s personality. Thus, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be higher.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can make a rough estimate of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics needed in these fields. For precise probabilities, actual data would be required.
