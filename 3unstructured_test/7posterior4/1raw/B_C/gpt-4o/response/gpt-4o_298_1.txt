To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions need to be made about prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) because these values are not specified. For simplicity, let's assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for each field, and focus the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on how closely Adam's personality traits align with typical traits in those fields. This will require a qualitative assessment of alignment.

1. **Business Administration:**
    - Typically involves leadership, management, communication, and strategic thinking.
    - Less emphasis on curiosity about nature, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts compared to other fields.
    
    Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - Often involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, puzzles, and high intelligence.
    - Openness to curiosity in nature and a quiet demeanour may also be fitting.
    - Somewhat relevant for empathy due to user experience considerations.
    
    Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is high.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's use arbitrary numerical ranges to express this:

- Assume:
   - Prior probabilities \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
   - Likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
   - Likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.8 \)
   - We don't need \( P(E) \) to compare as it is constant.

We normalize to ensure the values reflect our assessments within these findings. Therefore, the probability estimates (which are relative and illustrative) are:

```python
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

These values are based on the high likelihood that Adam's personality aligns significantly more with what one would expect from a computer science graduate student than a business administration graduate student. Adjustments can be made based on more precise estimations of \( P(E|H) \) or \( P(H) \).
