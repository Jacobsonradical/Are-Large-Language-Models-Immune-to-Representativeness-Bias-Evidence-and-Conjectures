To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have actual numerical values for these probabilities, we'll reason qualitatively based on the given information to estimate the probabilities.

### Prior probabilities \(P(H)\):

Assume a general distribution of graduate students across fields:
- Let's hypothesize that the prior probability \(P(H)\) for computer science and business administration are roughly equal due to the lack of specific population data, but we'll consider general trends where certain fields might be more popular.

### Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts is highly aligned with computer science.
- Enjoying solving puzzles also suggests a natural fit for computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and animals, however, are not directly relevant but do not detract.
- Likelihood might be moderately high because of the strong fit with essential skills.

**Business Administration:**
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can fit, but to a lesser degree than in computer science.
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might fit well in the context of leadership within business administration.
- Curiosity about nature and animals and solving puzzles are less pertinent.
- Likelihood is moderate but less convincing than for computer science.

### Posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\):

Knowing this, \(P(H|E)\) for each field would be roughly estimated based on how well Adam’s characteristics match the fields.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

### Explanation:
- We estimate a higher likelihood for computer science (0.65) due to Adam’s intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving preferences aligning well with the field.
- Business administration is less likely (0.35) but still plausible given his empathy and appreciation for hard work, which are beneficial in business leadership roles.

Remember, these are qualitative estimates and would be more accurate with specific numerical data regarding distributions and field-specific likelihoods for such personality traits.
