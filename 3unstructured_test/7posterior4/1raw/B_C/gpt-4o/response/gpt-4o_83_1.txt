To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

For this question, we must estimate these probabilities based on the personality sketch of Adam and the fields of computer science and business administration. Here are the steps:

1. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. We need to assess how likely it is for someone in each field to have the personality described.
2. **Estimate \( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability of the hypothesis based on how common it is for graduate students to be in each field.
3. **Estimate \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the evidence, incorporating all possible fields. Since we don't have specific data, we can use a common technique of normalizing later.

Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and intelligence:

- **Computer Science Hypothesis (H_CS)**
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): A quiet individual who enjoys solving puzzles, is intelligent and understands abstract concepts aligns fairly well with profiles in computer science.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) to be about 0.6.

- **Business Administration Hypothesis (H_BA)**
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Strong empathy and warm heart can fit a business administration profile, but curiosity about nature and solving puzzles might be slightly less aligned.
  - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) to be about 0.3.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
  - Computer Science is a common graduate field.
  - Let's assign \( P(H_{CS}) \) a value of 0.3.
  - Business Administration is also a common field.
  - Let's assign \( P(H_{BA}) \) a value of 0.3.

To find \( P(E) \), we should sum over all possible fields, but for simplicity, let's normalize using the provided hypotheses.

Using Bayes' rule and normalizing:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

Since the specific \( P(E) \) isn't known, for normalization, let's keep both sums equal and proportional:

Normalizing factor:
\[ P(E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.3 \times 0.3) = 0.18 + 0.09 = 0.27 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.33 \]

Thus the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
