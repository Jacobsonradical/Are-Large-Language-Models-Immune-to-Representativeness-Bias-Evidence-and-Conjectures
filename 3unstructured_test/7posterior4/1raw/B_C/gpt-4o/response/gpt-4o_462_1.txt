To use Bayes' rule for calculating the posterior probabilities, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing the evidence given that he is in each field. However, since we don't have numerical prior probabilities or specific likelihoods, we will make some educated estimations based on the given personality sketch and the nature of the fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can still discuss relative likelihoods based on the personality sketch.

### Computer Science
- **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, along with understanding abstract concepts, makes it quite likely that he could be in computer science. Empathy and love for animals are less directly related but don't conflict with the possibility.
- **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Computer science is a very common field for graduate studies, which suggests a higher prior.

### Business Administration
- **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** While business administration could involve understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication, Adam’s personality sketch suggests a stronger inclination toward natural sciences or technical fields rather than a focus on business. Additionally, the traits like a genuine curiosity about nature and animals may not align typically with business administration.
- **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Business administration is also a common field but may have a slightly lower prior given Adam’s interests.

Considering these points, let's estimate the relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values represent an educated estimation based on how well Adam's personality aligns with the respective fields, given the information in the sketch. The values do not need to add up to 1 because they consider only these two fields among many possible fields.
