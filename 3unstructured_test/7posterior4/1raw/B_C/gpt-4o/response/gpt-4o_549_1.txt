To compute the posterior conditional probability, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that hypothesis \( H \) (specific field of study) is true given the evidence \( E \) (personality sketch of Adam).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Assuming we don’t have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can informally estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality traits align with the typical traits expected for each field. We then use these estimations to compare the fields.

### Estimating P(E|H):
1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (strong match).
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (strong match).
   - Quiet and introspective nature can fit with common perceptions of people in this field.
   - Nature and animals might be less relevant but aren’t contradictory.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - High intelligence (matches).
   - Strong empathy and warm heart (good fit for people-oriented roles).
   - Quiet nature might be slightly less aligned with the typical need for networking and extroversion in business settings.
   - Appreciation for hard work (good fit).

### Assigning Informal Probabilities:
- For simplicity, let’s assign relative probabilities \( P(E|H) \) based on subjective alignments.

Assume:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.75 \) for Computer Science, reflecting the strong match.
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) = 0.4 \) for Business Administration, reflecting some but fewer strong alignments.

### Prior Estimates \( P(H) \):
Without explicit data, we might assume the following for rough illustrative purposes:
- \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.3 \) as a roughly common field for high-achieving graduates.
- \( P(H_{ba}) = 0.2 \) as another common field.

Given:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs}) + P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba}) + \ldots \]

Let’s cancel \( P(E) \) assuming we're only interested in comparative probabilities and not absolute values.

### Calculation:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{cs})P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{ba})P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

So, the relative probabilities are:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.75 \times 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.4 \times 0.2 \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.225 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.08 \]

### Normalizing:
Finally, since we need values between 0 and 1 and should correspond to relative likelihoods:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.225,
  "business administration": 0.08
}
```

This provides a comparative look at the relative strengths of the hypotheses given the evidence.
