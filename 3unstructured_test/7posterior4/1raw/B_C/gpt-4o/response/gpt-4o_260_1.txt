Let's break down the problem using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which in this case is the personality sketch of Adam.

We need to estimate:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given how personality traits align with certain fields, we can reasonably estimate \( P(E|H) \). Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, assuming equal priors across various graduate programs for simplicity.

### Computer Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits — high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles — these are quite consistent with characteristics often found in computer science students. While not all computer science students have these traits, many do.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assuming an equal likelihood among multiple fields, a typical institution might have a significant number of computer science students.

### Business Administration
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Traits such as empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work align somewhat but not strongly with typical characteristics often associated with business administration students.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is also a common field among graduate programs.

Without concrete data on prior distributions or detailed base rates, we'll rely on how well Adam's traits align with the traits generally associated with these fields. Note that these estimates incorporate some degree of subjectivity.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Here, 0.7 for computer science reflects that Adam's traits align well with typical characteristics of computer science students. The 0.4 for business administration reflects that while some traits match, there is a less strong alignment with the typical characteristics of business administration students.
