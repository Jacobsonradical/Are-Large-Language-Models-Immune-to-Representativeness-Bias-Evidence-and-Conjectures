To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihoods and priors for the fields "computer science" and "business administration" based on Adam's characteristics:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and puzzles aligns well with the field.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
   - Less emphasis on empathy and love for animals but still could be plausible due to parallel domains like bioinformatics.
   - Dedication and hard work are universal traits.

   Tentative assessment:
   \[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \] is relatively high.
   \[ P(\text{computer science}) \] is not infrequent among graduate students.
   
   Overall, let's assume a plausible value for comparison.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Curiosity about nature might be less directly relevant.
   - Empathy and understanding human behavior are beneficial.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles can align with problem-solving in business cases.
   - Dedication and hard work are critical traits in business.

   Tentative assessment:
   \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \] is moderate.
   \[ P(\text{business administration}) \] is also a frequent field among graduate students.
   
   Overall, let's assume a plausible value for comparison.

Given that we don't have precise numerical values, let's use the qualitative information to estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.55,
  "business administration": 0.40
}
```

Please note that these values are rough estimates and would ideally require more precise statistical data to compute accurately. Nonetheless, based on the qualitative fit of Adam's characteristics, computer science appears slightly more probable than business administration.
