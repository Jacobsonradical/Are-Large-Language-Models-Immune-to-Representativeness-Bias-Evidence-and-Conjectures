To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): This represents the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. The prior probability \( P(H) \): This represents the initial probability of the hypothesis \( H \) before considering the evidence.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, we will make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch.

### For Business Administration:

Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- Business Administration might not typically attract individuals with a strong curiosity about nature and plants.
- It might involve abstract concepts, but less focus on nature and solving puzzles (which Adam enjoys).
- Empathy and a warm heart could be advantageous but are not exclusively linked to Business Administration.

***Estimated*** Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration: Low (e.g., 0.2)

Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
- Business Administration is a common field, but we don't have specific data, so let’s assume a moderate prior.

***Estimated*** Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate (e.g., 0.3)

### For Computer Science:

Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- Computer Science attracts individuals with high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoy solving puzzles.
- Curiosity about nature and strong empathy might be less directly related but not contradictory.
- Computer Science involves a good understanding and appreciation for hard work, which aligns with Adam’s personality.

***Estimated*** Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science: High (e.g., 0.7)

Prior Probability \( P(H) \):
- Computer Science is a common field.
- Given recent trends, it might be more likely than some other less common fields, but assume similar to business as a baseline.

***Estimated*** Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate (e.g., 0.3)

Reasoning can be simplified and aligned with the qualitative estimates directly proportional:
\[ P(Business\ Administration|E) = 0.2 * 0.3 \]
\[ P(Computer\ Science|E) = 0.7 * 0.3 \]

In the context of Bayes' *(not normalized here for simplicity)*:
\[
P(Business\ Administration|E) ≈ 0.06
\]
\[
P(Computer\ Science|E) ≈ 0.21
\]

Combining the findings:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.06,
  "computer science": 0.21
}
```

(Exact numerical values can vary as estimates are used and normalization required for absolute scale within finite hypotheses.)
