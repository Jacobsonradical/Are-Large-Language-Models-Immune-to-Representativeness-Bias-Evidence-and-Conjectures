To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam having each of the given characteristics in these specific fields. We'll denote:

- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) as the normalizing constant (which is not needed for relative comparisons as long as we're not summing to 1).

While we don't have explicit values for these probabilities, we can make qualitative judgments based on the given personality traits and typical characteristics of these fields of study. 

For a qualitative approach:

### Business Administration

- Business Administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills, a focus on management and leadership, an interest in economic trends, and often, a competitive or strategic mindset. While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well, his quiet nature, focus on abstract concepts, and deep love for animals do not align as closely with a typical Business Administration profile.
- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration may thus be moderate to low.
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) might also be lower given the specific traits described.

Overall: Lower probability value.

### Computer Science

- Computer Science often involves problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and logical thinking, which align well with Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of puzzle-solving, and understanding of abstract concepts.
- A deep love for animals and empathy might be less directly relevant but do not contradict this field.
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) for someone with Adam's traits might be higher for Computer Science given the alignment with key personality and skill traits.

Overall: Higher probability value.

### Posterior Probability Estimates

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign rough probabilities based on the relative alignment of Adam's traits with the fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values represent a qualitative judgment of how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field based on typical field requirements and characteristics.
