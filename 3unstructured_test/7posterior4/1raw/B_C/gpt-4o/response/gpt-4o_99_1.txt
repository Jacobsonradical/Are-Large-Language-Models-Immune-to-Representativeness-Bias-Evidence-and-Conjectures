To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to rewrite Bayes' rule in the context of the problem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we are comparing two specific hypotheses, we only need the relative probabilities (that is, how much more likely one field is compared to the other given \( E \)), meaning we can ignore \( P(E) \) because it will be the same for both fields.

We make assumptions about \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) based on typical domain knowledge:
1. \( P(H) \): Without additional information, we assume that all graduate fields are equally likely.
2. \( P(E|H) \): This is based on how well Adamâ€™s personality sketch matches the typical characteristics of students in each field.

### Assumptions about Likelihoods:

Given Adam's profile:
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: This would be very favorable for Computer Science.
- Curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals: This could align more with fields like biology or environmental science, less with Business Administration.
- Quiet, solving puzzles: Favorable for fields that require deep thought and individual work, like Computer Science.
- Strong empathy and warm heart: Unclear strong advantage for either field, but often associated with roles in helping fields or those involving people.

Given these considerations, we will rate the likelihoods accordingly:
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Medium-low (0.2 - 0.3)
- \( P(E|H_{comp_science}) \): High (0.6 - 0.7)

#### Computation:

Since this problem revolves around relative likelihoods, we apply the above estimates directly.

{
  "business administration": "0.25",
  "computer science": "0.65"
}

Note: These values are rational estimates based on the given profile and standard assumptions about the fields. They are not precise computations but provide a rough likelihood based on available information.
