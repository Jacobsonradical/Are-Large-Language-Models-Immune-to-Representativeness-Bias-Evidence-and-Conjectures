To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express the problem in the following way:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

As we don't have specific numbers for prior probabilities or exact likelihoods, we will make educated estimates based on the nature of the fields and Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration \( P(H_{BA}|E) \)**:

- **Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Let's assume a reasonable prior probability for someone choosing Business Administration among all possible fields of study. For simplicity, let's assume a moderately even distribution across various fields, so say it's \( 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Given the personality sketch, Adam's traits are somewhat less aligned with typical Business Administration students. Business students might be expected to have a more extroverted disposition due to networking and leadership roles. Thus, we estimate a relatively lower probability here, say \( 0.2 \).

2. **Computer Science \( P(H_{CS}|E) \)**:

- **Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Similarly, let's assume a prior probability for someone choosing Computer Science. Given the popularity of the field, we might set this slightly higher, say \( 0.25 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: The traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving fit well with the profile of a Computer Science student. Curiosity about nature can correlate with a broader interest in understanding complex systems. Thus, we set a higher probability here, say \( 0.6 \).

Using Bayes' rule without the exact values of \( P(E) \), we will estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively.

{
  "business administration": "0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03",
  "computer science": "0.25 * 0.6 = 0.15"
}

Thus, we get:

{
  "business administration": "0.03",
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Again, these values should be taken as qualitative estimates rather than precise computations.
