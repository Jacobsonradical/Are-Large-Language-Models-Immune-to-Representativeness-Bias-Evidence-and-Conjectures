To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for the fields given Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need several pieces of information to perform this calculation: the probability of Adam's personality traits given he is in each field (\(P(E|H)\)), the prior probability of each field (\(P(H)\)), and the overall probability of Adam's personality traits (\(P(E)\)).

Since we do not have specific probabilities for these, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the traits described and the nature of the fields. 

Factors considered:
1. Fields typically associated with high intelligence and abstract thinking: Both Computer Science and Business Administration.
2. Fields where a love for nature, animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work fits well: Computer Science may have a slight edge due to its compatibility with solving puzzles.
3. Quiet and puzzle-solving traits: Computer Science has a closer match than Business Administration, which often requires frequent interaction and communication skills.

Given these considerations and assuming \(P(H)\) for both fields is roughly equivalent, we can qualitatively assign higher likelihood to Computer Science:

\[P(E | \text{Computer Science})\) > P(E | \text{Business Administration})\]

Therefore, qualitatively:

\[
\begin{cases}
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.7 \\
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx 0.3
\end{cases}
\]

So, the answer in the desired format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
