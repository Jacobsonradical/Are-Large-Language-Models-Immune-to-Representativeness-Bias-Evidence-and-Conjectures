To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for Adam being enrolled in various fields such as computer science and business administration using Bayes' rule requires having the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each field. However, in the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we can make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
1. He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a strong empathy and love for animals.
4. He has high intelligence and understands abstract concepts.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's qualitatively assess the suitability of computer science and business administration based on this sketch:

### Computer Science
- Curiosity about nature and solving puzzles might suggest an inclination towards analytical fields, including computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are favorable traits for success in computer science.
- Computer science also often requires dedication to solving complex problems.

### Business Administration
- While empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant in business contexts, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are more aligned with fields like biology or environmental science rather than business.
- Business administration may not strongly align with his passion for nature and animals.
- Abstract thinking and intelligence are beneficial, but solving nature-related puzzles is less directly applicable.

Without specific numerical data but based on qualitative assessments, here are the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

This assumes a higher likelihood that Adam's interests and skills align more closely with computer science than business administration. Note that these values are purely indicative and should be considered as qualitative estimates rather than precise calculations.
