Bayes' rule allows us to update our prior beliefs in light of new evidence. When calculating the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), the formula we use is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

For this exercise, it's important to have estimates for these probabilities. Since we don't have numerical priors or likelihoods, I'll provide a reasonable intuitive assessment based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \[ P(H) \]: Assume it's relatively high since many graduate students in 2021 are in computer science.
   - \[ P(E|H) \]: The traits of strong intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles fit well with a computer science student.
   - \[ P(E) \]: Personality traits such as empathy might be less stereotypical, but not unrelated.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \[ P(H) \]: Likely lower than for computer science given the subjects' specific characteristics.
   - \[ P(E|H) \]: Some traits (e.g., genuine curiosity, appreciation of hard work) align, but empathy and love for animals are less directly related to this field.
   - \[ P(E) \]: As with computer science, not the strongest fit.

Considering these factors and making a qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This represents a greater fit for Adam as a graduate student in computer science given his personality traits, with a somewhat lower fit for business administration. Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the described personality characteristics and common associations with these fields.
