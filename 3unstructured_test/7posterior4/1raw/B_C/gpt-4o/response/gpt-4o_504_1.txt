To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing factor \( P(E) \). However, due to the lack of specific numeric data, we'll adopt a qualitative reasoning approach.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's interest in puzzles and high intelligence make Computer Science a plausible field. Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are often associated with success in Computer Science. His quiet nature and preference for understanding and analyzing could also align well with the demands of the field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While Business Administration often values strong communication and leadership skills, Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant. However, the sketch doesn't indicate a strong inclination towards business-oriented skills like strategic thinking, management, or finance.

Based on these qualitative considerations, we can infer the probabilities as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the qualitative analysis of the information provided in the personality sketch.
