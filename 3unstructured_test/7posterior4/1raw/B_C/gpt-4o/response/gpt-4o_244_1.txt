To apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam \( E \), we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in real-world scenarios, we often lack precise numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we use qualitative reasoning based on the information given.

Let's deduce the probabilities in a qualitative manner:

1. **Business Administration:**

- Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, a deep love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciates hard work and dedication.
- Business Administration often involves leadership, management skills, financial acumen, and a focus on organizational behavior, which are not directly aligned with Adam's described traits.
- Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) that someone with Adam's personality would be studying business administration might be moderately low.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \] is moderately low.
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) \] is likely moderate, as many U.S. graduate students enroll in business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**

- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high level of intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are highly relevant traits for computer science.
- These traits make it more probable that Adam would be studying in a field like computer science.
- Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) that someone with Adam's personality would be studying computer science is higher.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \] is high.
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) \] is also moderately high, as computer science is a common field among U.S. graduate students.

Given that we don't have precise numerical values, we make educated guesses to rank the fields:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods based on qualitative reasoning, not exact probabilities.
