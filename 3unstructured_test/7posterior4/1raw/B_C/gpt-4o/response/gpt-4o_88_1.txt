Bayes' rule for conditional probability is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don’t have explicit probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will have to make educated estimates based on the information given about Adam and typical characteristics or probabilities associated with these fields of study.

For each field, we can reason as follows:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Computer science students are often intelligent and good at solving abstract problems (matching Adam's high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills). However, computer science is not primarily associated with a deep love for animals or nature.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a common field of graduate study in the U.S.
   - Considering Adam’s traits, \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is moderate.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Business administration students might have strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, but typically, they are not necessarily characterized by a deep love for nature and animals.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is also a popular field of graduate study in the U.S.
   - Considering Adam’s traits, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is low to moderate.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can come up with a rough estimation. 

Given that we need numeric values between 0 and 1, and relative probabilities must somewhat reflect our analysis:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values reflect that Adam’s characteristics better align with those typical of a computer science student rather than a business administration student, albeit with moderate certainty.
