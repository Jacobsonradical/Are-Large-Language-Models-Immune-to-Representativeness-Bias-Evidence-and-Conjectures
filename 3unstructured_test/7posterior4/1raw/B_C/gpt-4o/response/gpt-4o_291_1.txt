To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the following steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule Formula**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
   - \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   Without specific data, we can assume each field has an equal prior probability \( P(H) \). Suppose there are \( N \) relevant fields, then each field might have a prior probability of \( \frac{1}{N} \).

3. **Likelihood**:
   The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) reflects how well the personality sketch E matches a typical student enrolled in each field. Here, subjective judgment based on provided traits and common characteristics for students in each field is applied.

Let's estimate the relative likelihoods based on the available information.

- **Business Administration**:
  - **P(E|H):** The characteristics desirable for business administration might include leadership, outgoing personality, strategic thinking, and business acumen. Adam’s warmth, empathy, and high intelligence might slightly support this hypothesis, especially understanding and appreciation of hard work. However, traits like quietness and love for nature/plants do not lean strongly toward business administration.

- **Computer Science**:
  - **P(E|H):** Characteristics desirable for computer science typically include strong problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, intelligence, and perhaps a more introverted personality. Adam's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align nicely with these traits.

Given that Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) fits more closely with a field like computer science than business administration, we need to assign a higher relative likelihood to computer science.

Let's also assume we have no strong prior reason to believe Adam is more likely to be enrolled in one field over another (i.e., \( P(H) \) is uniform across fields, but not needed to make an accurate subjective probability).

Thus, the subjective estimates for \( P(E|H) \) would be:
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration: Low (Let’s assign an approximate subjective value of 0.2)
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: High (Let’s assign an approximate subjective value of 0.8)

Given that these two fields are competing hypotheses and simplifying by ignoring the normalization constant for brevity:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.8
}
```

Please note these values are subjective estimates rather than empirically derived probabilities but should fit within the given personality sketch of Adam.
