To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we should consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Since insufficient data is provided to compute the exact probability values, let's use subjective reasoning based on the provided description.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, there is a reasonable likelihood he could be in computer science. But his strong empathy and love for animals are not particularly characteristic of the typical computer science student.
   - **P(H)**: Graduate computer science programs are quite common.
   - **P(E)**: The personality traits specified (intelligence, curiosity, problem-solving) align moderately well with the computer science field.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication are valuable traits for someone in business administration, but his deep love for nature and animals does not strongly align with the typical business administration stereotype.
   - **P(H)**: Graduate business administration programs are very common.
   - **P(E)**: The specific traits (warm heart, strong empathy) align decently but not strongly with a business administration program.

Given these subjective evaluations, I'd estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these values are rough subjective estimates due to insufficient exact data and should be taken as such. The completeness and consistency of the data could substantially improve these estimates.
