To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make educated guesses based on the information provided in the personality sketch \( E \). Here's a qualitative assessment:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with what's typically valued in computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits the problem-solving nature of the field.
    - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer science is a common field for graduate students.
    - Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): Likely high, given Adam's traits.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): While Adam's attributes like strong empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable in business administration, his deep love for nature and solving puzzles do not strongly align with typical traits encouraged specifically in this field.
    - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business administration is also a common field for graduate students.
    - Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): Potentially lower compared to computer science given his personality sketch.

Given these qualitative assessments, we assign a higher posterior conditional probability for computer science and a lower one for business administration.

Based on these considerations, we provide the following estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on subjective interpretation and assumed distributions of evidence alignment with different fields.
