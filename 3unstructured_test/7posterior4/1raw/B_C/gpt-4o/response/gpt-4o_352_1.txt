To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given these hypotheses, and then compute \( P(H|E) \).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll provide a qualitative assessment of how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Likelihood Assessment:
1. **Business Administration**:  
   - Pros: Adam's high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit into the demands of a business administration program.
   - Cons: The personality sketch does not emphasize a strong interest in business, economics, or management, and business administration typically demands strong social interaction skills, which is not highlighted in the sketch.

2. **Computer Science**:  
   - Pros: Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the nature of computer science. His quiet nature and empathy might also suit roles in computer science where collaboration on technical problems is key but intense social interaction might be less critical.
   - Cons: Strong empathy and love for animals are not directly relevant to computer science but don't necessarily rule it out either.

Based on this qualitative assessment:
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \) might be relatively low because there is little in the sketch about business interests.
- \( P(E|H_{computer}) \) might be higher because his qualities align well with the nature of computer science.

Since we don't have exact probabilities, we'll make an informed guess based on the qualitative assessment.
