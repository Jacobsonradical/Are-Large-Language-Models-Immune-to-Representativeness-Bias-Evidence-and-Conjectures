To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make educated guesses based on the provided information.

### Business Administration
- Businesses administration might not directly align with Adam's strong empathy and deep love for animals.
- The curiosity about nature, plants, and understanding of abstract concepts is not typically emphasized in business administration.
- Empathy and a warm heart could be useful in leadership, but it's not a strong indicator by itself.

### Computer Science
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with problem-solving skills needed in computer science.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are strong fits for a field that often involves theoretical and algorithmic thinking.

Given these qualitative alignments, we can make educated guesses at the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
```

These values are hypothetical and based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality sketch with the fields in question. In practice, more detailed statistical analysis and data would be required for precise probability calculations.
