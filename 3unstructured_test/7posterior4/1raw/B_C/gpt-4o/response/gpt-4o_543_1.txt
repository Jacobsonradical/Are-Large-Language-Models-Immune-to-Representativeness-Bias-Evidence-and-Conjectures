To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors or the likelihoods, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch of Adam:

**Computer Science:**
- Pros: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Cons: Strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature and its plants (these traits may correlate more with fields that directly involve interactions with living things).

**Business Administration:**
- Pros: High intelligence, understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- Cons: Quiet disposition, strong empathy, deep love for nature and animals (traits that might lean more towards research or fieldwork-oriented fields).

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign rough probabilities to each hypothesis based on how well the characteristics match the typical traits and interests of students in each field.

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are subjective estimates based on the qualitative fit between Adam's personality sketch and the general characteristics of students in the specified fields. Actual probabilities would require more specific data on the distribution of personalities in each field of study.
