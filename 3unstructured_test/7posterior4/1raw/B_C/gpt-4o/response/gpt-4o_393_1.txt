To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Bayes' Rule Formula**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Explanation of Terms**:
   - \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specified field.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in the specified field.
   - \( P(E) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch overall.

To make the problem more straightforward, we'll qualitatively estimate the probabilities based on typical traits associated with each field.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Likely high, as computer science often attracts people who are good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts, and exhibit high intelligence.
   - **\( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in computer science. It's a reasonably popular field.
   - **\( P(E) \)**: Probability of Adam's personality profile which is composite and should consider overlaps with various fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **\( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Likely lower than for computer science, as business administration generally attracts people who are more extroverted and focused on interpersonal skills rather than quiet, puzzle-solving traits.
   - **\( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in business administration. This is also a popular field, but the fit with Adam's profile might be less.
   - **\( P(E) \)**: Again, same composite probability of Adam's overall personality profile.

### Qualitative Values:
Without exact numerical data, we'll provide qualitative estimates:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_{CS}) & \approx 0.7 \\
P(H_{CS}) & \approx 0.2 \quad \text{(since it's a popular field)} \\
P(E) & \approx 1.0 \quad \text{(normalized probability across all fields)}
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_{BA}) & \approx 0.3 \\
P(H_{BA}) & \approx 0.15 \quad \text{(also a popular field but less likely for Adam)} \\
P(E) & \approx 1.0 \quad \text{(same normalization)}
\end{align*}
\]

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
For Computer Science:
\[ 
P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{1.0} = 0.14 
\]

For Business Administration:
\[ 
P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{1.0} = 0.045 
\]

### Final Posterior Probabilities:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.14",
  "business administration": "0.045"
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in a computer science program than in a business administration program as of 2021.
