To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

- \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\)

However, since we don't have explicit values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\), we'll have to estimate these probabilities qualitatively based on the information given about Adam.

Here is the qualitative reasoning behind the probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is described as having high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits that are commonly found in computer science students.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles also aligns well with skills used in computer programming and algorithm development.
   - Curiosity about nature and empathy might not be strong indicators but do not contradict computer science as a field either.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically requires strong interpersonal skills and interest in management, finance, or entrepreneurship.
   - While Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be beneficial in business administration, his other traits like interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract concepts make a slightly weaker case for this field compared to computer science.

Given these analyses, we can assign estimated probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in computer science based on his personality traits and interests, while still acknowledging the possibility of business administration.
