To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the prior probabilities, the likelihoods, and the evidence. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

However, since we don't have the precise values of these probabilities, we can only make educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge about the fields.

Here are some assumptions we can make:
- Adam is curious about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, high intelligence, and a love for animals.
- These traits seem to align more with fields involving analytical thinking and empathy, which may be more prevalent in certain fields.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities
- The prior \( P(H) \) for each field could be assumed based on the general popularity of the fields among graduate students, but since this isn't specified, we'll treat them as equal for simplicity.

### Likelihoods
- \( P(E|H) \) will be assessed based on how well the personality sketch fits what is typically seen in students of the field.

#### Computer Science
- Likely to have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
- May or may not have a strong appreciation for the hard work (depends on the individual).
- Love for nature and animals is less relevant but doesn't negatively impact.

#### Business Administration
- Could have empathy and warm heart, especially in roles related to leadership and corporate social responsibility.
- Appreciation for hard work.
- Curiosity about nature and animals may be less relevant.

Based on these initial assessments:

### Computing Posterior Probabilities
Let's provide qualitative estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,  // Adamâ€™s problem-solving skills, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts align well with this field.
  "business administration": 0.3  // Some empathy and appreciation for hard work align, but the fit is less strong compared to computer science.
}

These values are hypothetical estimates to demonstrate the relationships qualitatively. For precise values, we'd need actual data on the likelihoods and priors.
