To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, in the absence of specific numerical values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics of these fields and Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which can be seen as a normalizing constant.

Since we are not provided with precise data, we can focus on the qualitative assessment:

### Assumptions:

#### 1. Computer Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: High, as Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the analytical and intellectual demands of computer science.
- **Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)**: Moderate to high, given the popularity of computer science among graduate students in the U.S.

#### 2. Business Administration 
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Lower than computer science, as Adam's personality traits (strong empathy, love for animals, interest in nature) don't strongly align with the typical focus areas of business administration (though empathy can be a useful trait in business leadership).
- **Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Moderate, considering business administration is also a popular graduate field.

Given the qualitative assessment, we hypothesize the following posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

These values reflect the alignment of Adam's traits and interests with the fields, his potential aptitude, and the common prior likelihoods for these fields among graduate students.
