To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we'd typically need:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field, which represents how common it is for someone to be enrolled in that field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which indicates how probable the given personality sketch \( E \) is under the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in that field.

Unfortunately, in a typical prompt like this, we don't have access to actual statistical data for these values. Therefore, Iâ€™ll provide a reasoned estimation based on the given personality sketch.

### Reasoned Estimation:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Business administration is a fairly common field of study, so its prior probability is likely moderate.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The personality traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in puzzles do not strongly align with the typical characteristics expected for business administration. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Computer Science is also a common field of graduate study.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Many traits mentioned in the personality sketch, such as high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, align well with a typical computer science student. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively high.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can provide the following rough estimations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are purely illustrative and would need to be refined with actual data to be more precise. However, based on the provided description, Adam's personality aligns more closely with the characteristics commonly associated with computer science.
