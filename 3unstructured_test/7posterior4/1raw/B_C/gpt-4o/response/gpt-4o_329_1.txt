To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of each field \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of Adam's personality sketch given the field, and the normalizing factor \( P(E) \).

In the absence of specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will instead provide qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

1. **computer science**:
   - Traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, interest in solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are compatible with someone in the field of computer science.

2. **business administration**:
   - Traits such as a warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals do not typically align closely with the stereotypical profile of a business administration student. However, the appreciation for hard work and dedication does.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with these fields. In real scenarios, specific numerical data and additional context would be required for precise computation.
