To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). In this case, we do not have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, but we can make educated guesses based on the information provided.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - For **Business Administration**: Let's assume the prior probability is low since Adam's personality sketch doesn't clearly align with a business-oriented profile. Let's say \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).
   - For **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking, and interest in puzzles, the prior probability might be more favorable. Let’s say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **Business Administration**: The likelihood is likely lower given the traits described. Let’s estimate it to be \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).
   - For **Computer Science**: The likelihood is higher due to his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. Let’s estimate it to be \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: 
   - The evidence is constant for both cases as it refers to Adam’s overall likelihood to exhibit these traits. For simplicity, assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for calculation and normalization purposes.

### Calculations:
#### For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Normalized Values:
Since we aren’t given \( P(E) \), we can only compare the likelihoods proportionally without exact values. These likelihoods show that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Computer Science rather than Business Administration based on the given personality sketch. To normalize these, we can consider their relative proportions:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) / P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.1} = 0.2 \]

Thus, if \( P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.2 \), then \( P(H_{CS}|E) = 1 \).

To convert these into a range between 0 and 1 for easier comparison, let’s normalize further:

Total sum = 0.2 + 1 = 1.2
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.2}{1.2} \approx 0.167 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{1}{1.2} \approx 0.833 \]

### Final Probabilities:
