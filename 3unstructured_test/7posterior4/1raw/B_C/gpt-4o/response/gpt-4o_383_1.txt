To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of his personality traits given his enrollment in those fields. Since this information is not provided, I will make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch.

Generally, personality traits like curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and high intelligence can be strong indicators for a field like computer science. On the other hand, the traits of strong empathy and appreciation for hard work could be relevant in business administration but might be less directly connected.

For the purpose of this exercise, I'll make the following qualitative estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) align well with the typical traits of a computer science student.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work are valuable traits in business administration; however, Adam's specific interests (nature, puzzles, animals) are less typically aligned with this field.

Thus, assuming equal prior probabilities for Adam being in any graduate field, we can qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities. Here's the output in the desired format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are not exact and should be interpreted as qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch and common associations with each field. Actual posterior probabilities would require more precise data.
