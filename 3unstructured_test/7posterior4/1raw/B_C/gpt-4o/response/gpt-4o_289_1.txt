Sure, I'll compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. The rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the terms needed for this calculation:

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in a particular field.
2. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam is in that particular field.
3. **\( P(E) \)**: The evidence, or the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don't have specific priors and likelihoods, I'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Assumptions:

- **Computer Science**: 
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking (high \( P(E|H) \)).
  - Empathy and love for nature and animals (lower \( P(E|H) \)).
- **Business Administration**: 
  - Strong understanding and appreciation for dedication and hard work (high \( P(E|H) \)).
  - Empathy can be common, but love for nature and animals (lower \( P(E|H) \)).

### Likelihoods and Priors:

To provide a rough estimate, I'll assume the following likelihoods and priors:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)

The evidence \( P(E) \) can be normalized across all potential fields, but it is not necessary to explicitly compute this if we are only interested in relative comparisons.

### Computations:

1. For Computer Science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}
   \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

2. For Business Administration:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)}
   \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
   \]

Now, normalizing these probabilities relative to each other (as we can ignore \( P(E) \)):

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total} &= 0.15 + 0.06 = 0.21 \\
P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) &= \frac{0.15}{0.21} \approx 0.71 \\
P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) &= \frac{0.06}{0.21} \approx 0.29 \\
\end{align*}
\]

So the answers, approximated, are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.71,
  "business administration": 0.29
}
```
