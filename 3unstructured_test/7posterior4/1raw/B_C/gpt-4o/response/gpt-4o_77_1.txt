To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand how Bayes' rule works. The rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

While we typically need actual numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) to compute \( P(H|E) \) precisely, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and characteristics of typical fields.

Given the information in the sketch about Adam:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We can qualitatively assess the fit of Adam's traits to the likelihood of enrolling in each field:

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are good fits.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well with computer science problem-solving.
- Quiet and introspective behavior is also common in the field.

### Business Administration
- Strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial for leadership and management roles.
- Dedication and appreciation for hard work are significant in the field.
- However, there is less of a direct link with his curiosity about nature and love for animals compared to other personalities better suited for business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize the posterior probabilities:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
\]

These values reflect a higher probability for computer science based on the personality sketch but still acknowledge a reasonable chance for business administration, given the strong empathy and understanding of dedication.
