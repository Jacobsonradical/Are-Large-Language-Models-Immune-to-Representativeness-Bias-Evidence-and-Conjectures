To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this specific case, I do not have access to precise numerical probabilities such as \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \). These probabilities would typically be derived from data or detailed knowledge of student enrollment in various fields and the characteristics of those fields.

Instead, I'll make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and common characteristics of these fields.

- **Computer Science:** Adam's high intelligence, curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts match well with the skills and interests needed for computer science. Computer science often involves solving logical puzzles, understanding abstract algorithms, and requires a high level of intelligence.
- **Business Administration:** While Adam's warm heart and strong empathy may align with human resources and leadership roles in business administration, the emphasis on curiosity about nature, love for animals, and problem-solving in abstract ways is less directly aligned with typical business administration coursework.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can infer that the posterior probability may be higher for computer science than for business administration. Here are the qualitative posterior probabilities for the two fields:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Please note that these values are qualitative estimations rather than quantitatively computed probabilities since precise numerical information is not provided.
