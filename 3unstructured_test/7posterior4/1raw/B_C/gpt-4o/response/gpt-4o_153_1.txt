To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we can make qualitative assessments based on the given information about Adam's personality and interests.

### Steps:
1. **Identify Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**: Generally, for simplicity, we could assume that each field has an equal prior probability (which would be \( 0.5 \) for each, only considering these two fields). However, realistically, these probabilities can be different based on the popularity of the fields or other available data.
  
2. **Determine Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it seems likely that he could be in computer science.
   - **Business Administration**: Adam's attributes such as a warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might align less directly with business administration but could still fit certain aspects such as HR or CSR (corporate social responsibility).

3. **Normalize with \( P(E) \)** (Normalizing constant, which ensures probabilities add up to 1 over all possible fields).

Given the qualitative nature of the task, let's assign:

- For **Computer Science**: High likelihood due to intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles.
- For **Business Administration**: Lower likelihood due to less evidence aligning with this field's typical demands.

As we are not given exact numerical values for each component, I'll provide qualitative probabilities that reflect this.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values do not add up to 1 because we consider only two among many possible graduate fields.
