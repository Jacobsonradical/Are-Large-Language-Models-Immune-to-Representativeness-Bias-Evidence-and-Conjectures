To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must first express it as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have precise values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided about Adam's personality and common characteristics of students in the given fields.

Let's denote:
- "business administration" as \( H_{BA} \)
- "computer science" as \( H_{CS} \)

**Assumptions for calculation:**

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the overall likelihood that a student is enrolled in the given field, independent of Adam's characteristics. We will assume:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \) (assuming business administration is less common among graduate students in the general population)
   - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (assuming computer science is somewhat common among graduate students)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, given he is enrolled in the specific field.
   - For business administration:
     - Adam's empathy, love for nature, and puzzle-solving abilities could be less directly related to business administration.
     - Assume \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
   - For computer science:
     - Adam's high intelligence, abstract reasoning, and puzzle-solving skills align well with characteristics often found in computer science students.
     - Assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)

3. **Total probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the combination of all probabilities, \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \), across all fields. For simplicity, let's normalize to the fields we're considering:
   - Assuming there are other fields with independent probabilities that would sum the total to 1, we disregard these for simplicity.
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + \text{(other probabilities)} \)
   - Here, let's normalize with only the given two fields: 
     - \( P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.5 \cdot 0.3) = 0.02 + 0.15 = 0.17 \)

**Calculate Posterior Probabilities:**

1. **For business administration:**
   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.17} \approx \frac{0.02}{0.17} \approx 0.12 \]

2. **For computer science:**
   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.17} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.17} \approx 0.88 \]

Based on these assumptions, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "computer science": 0.88
}
