To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to consider three main components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this case, we do not have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods given. Instead, we can qualitatively assess the fits based on Adam's personality traits and interests compared to the typical attributes and activities in each field.

For "computer science":
- High intelligence and good at solving puzzles: Strongly matches.
- Abstract concepts: Matches well.
- Curiosity about nature/plants and strong empathy: Neutral or only weakly related.
- Love for animals: Neutral or only weakly related.

For "business administration":
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Matches well.
- Empathy and a warm heart: Can be relevant.
- Curiosity about nature/plants and love for animals: Unlikely to be a direct fit.
- High intelligence and solving puzzles: Neutral fit.

Given this qualitative assessment, and considering that fields like biology or environmental science might be better fits for someone with Adam's interests, we can estimate the probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These values suggest that based on the provided personality sketch and without additional specific data, Adam is somewhat more likely to be enrolled in computer science than business administration, though fields more closely related to his interests in nature and animals might be more likely overall.
