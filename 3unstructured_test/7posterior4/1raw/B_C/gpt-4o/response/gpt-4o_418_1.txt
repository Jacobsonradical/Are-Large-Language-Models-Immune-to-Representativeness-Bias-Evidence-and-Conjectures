To use Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis H being true.
3. **P(E)**: The probability of the evidence E.

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific values for these probabilities, we'll make reasoned assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the general characteristics of the fields.

### Assumptions and Reasoning

1. **P(E|H_computer_science)**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strongly associated with computer science.
   - Empathy and love for nature are less directly associated with this field.
   - Overall, Adam's traits align moderately well with computer science.

2. **P(E|H_business_administration)**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also valuable in business administration.
   - Empathy is a strong trait for business leaders, especially in roles involving human resources or corporate social responsibility.
   - However, Adam's love for nature and animals might align less with the typical characteristics of business students.

3. **P(H_computer_science)** and **P(H_business_administration)**:
   - The prior probabilities of Adam being in either field can be assumed to be reasonably equal without additional context.

4. **P(E)**:
   - The probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) is constant across all hypotheses, so it can be treated as a normalizing factor.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively. The estimates are not precise but are based on the alignment of Adam's traits with the fields.

### Estimated Posterior Probabilities

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

- **Computer Science (0.5)**: Given Adam's high intelligence, curiosity, and appreciation for abstract problem-solving, there is a moderately high probability he is in this field.
- **Business Administration (0.3)**: While business administration can involve empathy and intelligence, it is less closely aligned with Adam's specific traits like love for nature and animals. 

These values are indicative, not precise, and serve to illustrate how Bayesian probability can be applied given qualitative data.
