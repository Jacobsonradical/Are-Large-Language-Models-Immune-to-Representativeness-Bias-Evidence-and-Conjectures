To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following inputs:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)** for each field: This represents the prior probability of a graduate student being in that field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** for each field: This denotes the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields of study.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we don't have specific numerical data, I'll provide a qualitative assessment:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - For business administration: While empathy and understanding abstract concepts might be relevant, traits like a strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles might be less common in this field.
    - For computer science: High intelligence, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant. However, the deep love for animals might be less directly connected but doesn't rule it out.

2. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Business administration is a common field, so we assume a moderate probability.
    - Computer science is also a common and growing field, so we assume it has a substantial probability too.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: Since we're comparing just these two fields, this remains the same for both.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's estimate (remember these are rough estimates based on the provided information):

\[ P(E|H_1) \] for business administration is relatively low due to the weak alignment with nature curiosity and love for animals: let's estimate 0.1.
\[ P(H_1) \] for business administration is moderate: let's estimate 0.4.

\[ P(E|H_2) \] for computer science is higher due to a better alignment with intellectual and puzzle-solving traits: let's estimate 0.6.
\[ P(H_2) \] for computer science is substantial: let's estimate 0.6.

We can somewhat neglect \( P(E) \) as it would affect both fields equally and thus cancel out in a relative comparison for the same person.

So the conditional probability estimates (normalized to provide qualitative understanding) are:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.6}{P(E)} \]

Given the normalization would likely reduce values proportionally, we'll provide relative estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.36
}
```

These values suggest that, based on Adam's personality profile, he is relatively more likely to be enrolled in computer science compared to business administration.
