To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in either field, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in each field, as well as the evidence \( P(E) \) which can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i)P(H_i) \]

However, we don't have concrete data for \( P(H) \) or \( P(E|H) \), so we can only provide subjective estimations based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's interest in nature, solving puzzles, animals, strong empathy, and abstract concepts, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) would be higher for fields that align with these interests and traits. 

Starting with computer science and business administration:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well.
    - Enjoys solving puzzles; curiosity fits well with the analytical nature of computer science.
    - Less directly tied to nature and animals unless focusing on specific applications (e.g., bioinformatics).

2. **Business Administration:**
    - High empathy could be useful in business roles that require interpersonal skills.
    - Less likely to involve solving puzzles or having a direct connection to nature and animals.

Using subjective reasoning:

- **Computer Science**: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high since the traits align well with computer science skills.
- **Business Administration**: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is lower since the traits are less directly related to this field.

Based on these subjective assessments, the posterior probabilities would be roughly estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note that these values are subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch and should be validated with actual data for higher accuracy.
