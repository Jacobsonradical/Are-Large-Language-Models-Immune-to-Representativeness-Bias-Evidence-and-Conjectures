To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider multiple factors, but for simplicity, we will focus on the relevance of Adam's personality traits and interests to the specified graduate fields. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we are not provided with specific values for these probabilities, we will make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \).

### Assumptions:
- **Computer Science (CS)**:
  - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are very relevant.
  - Solving puzzles could indicate strong problem-solving skills, relevant to coding and algorithm design.

- **Business Administration (BA)**:
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals might not be directly relevant. However, appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
  - The ability to solve puzzles could be beneficial in strategic planning and analytical aspects of business.

We'll proceed to estimate qualitative probabilities:

- **P(E|H)**:
  - For CS: High, as traits like high intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving are highly relevant.
  - For BA: Moderate, as empathy and understanding hard work are relevant, but traits like a deep love for animals and solving puzzles are less so.

- **P(H)**:
  - Assuming equal priors for simplicity, i.e., each field is equally likely a priori.

- **P(E)**:
  - The overall probability of the evidence \( E \) happening across all fields, which is constant for our purpose of comparison.

Given these considerations, let's approximate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The higher posterior probability for Computer Science reflects that Adam’s skills, such as understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, are more directly aligned with the typical requirements and nature of the CS field.
- The moderate posterior probability for Business Administration reflects that while some of Adam’s traits (like empathy and appreciation for hard work) may be relevant, they are not as directly aligned as they are for CS.
