To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of being in a specific field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of having the given personality sketch if enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence or the probability of the personality sketch across all fields.

Since the actual likelihoods and priors aren't provided and are likely field-specific, we must make reasonable qualitative assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) are less typical of business administration students.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The general prior probability of being in business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The traits such as high intelligence, appreciation for hard work, understanding abstract concepts, and liking puzzles are more common in computer science students.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The general prior probability of being in computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we make reasoned judgments:

- **Business Administration**: Low probability, given the mismatch in personality traits.
- **Computer Science**: Higher probability, given the strong alignment with the personality traits described.

Hence, an educated estimate might look like:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values suggest that given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science than business administration, though the precise numbers are qualitative estimates.
