Applying Bayes' Rule requires a bit more specific information than is given in the problem for a precise numerical computation since we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field. 

However, we can reason qualitatively about how likely Adam's personality and interests fit with each of the fields provided. Hereâ€™s a rough reasoning based on the information given:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Subject enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits suitable for Computer Science.
    - Understanding abstract concepts is very useful in Computer Science.
    - His curiosity about nature and empathy don't directly point towards Computer Science but don't exclude it either.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Business Administration typically requires skills in leadership, strategic thinking, and possibly some level of extroversion, which might not align strongly with Adam's description as a "quiet boy."
    - Empathy and understanding for hard work can be useful, but the other traits don't strongly indicate this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, Adam seems more fit for a field like Computer Science than Business Administration. The actual Bayesian computation needs specific prior and likelihood data, but we can assume the qualitative likelihoods might be roughly as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are illustrative and based on subjective reasoning about how Adam's characteristics align with each field. Generating precise probabilities would need quantitative prior information and exact likelihoods.
