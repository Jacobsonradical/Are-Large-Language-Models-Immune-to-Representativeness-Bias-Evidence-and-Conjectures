To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would generally need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis (field of study). However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these, we will need to make educated estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll reason qualitatively about \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration often requires strong leadership, strategic thinking, and people management skills.
   - The description of Adam emphasizes his curiosity about nature, love for animals, emotional empathy, and solving puzzles, which don't strongly correlate with typical traits for a business administration student.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) seems relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer science often requires problem-solving skills, intelligence, and the ability to understand abstract concepts.
   - These attributes match well with Adam's described characteristics (enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts).
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) seems relatively high.

Given these qualitative assessments and assuming we don't have reasons to believe Adam was particularly more or less likely to pursue either field (so the priors \( P(H) \) are not extremely skewed), we can hypothesize likely probabilities.

Based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note that these are simplified estimates meant to reflect the qualitative fit of Adam's personality to each field. In a real-world scenario, more precise prior and likelihood estimates would yield more accurate probabilities.
