To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since we do not have the specific values for these components, we need to make some assumptions based on common knowledge or reasonable estimations about the fields and Adam's personality.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Given Adam's high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, this field seems reasonably likely for him.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) (likelihood that Adam has the given traits if heâ€™s in computer science) might be moderately high.
   - \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) (general proportion of graduate students in computer science) would be relatively high as CS is a popular field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While business administration does require intelligence and understanding of concepts, it may not align as closely with Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals. These traits are more aligned with fields like psychology or environmental science.
   - \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) might be lower because the personality traits are not as strongly associated with business administration.
   - \(P(H_{\text{BA}})\) might be moderate as business administration is also a common field.

Given this reasoning, let's provide some reasonable estimations:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values illustrate our best-guess estimates based on the given descriptions and the compatibility of Adam's personality with each field. They reflect a higher likelihood for computer science over business administration, but still allow for a possibility in the latter.
