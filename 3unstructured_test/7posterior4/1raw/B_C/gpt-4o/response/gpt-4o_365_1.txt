To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field and how likely Adam's personality sketch \( E \) fits with those fields. Since specific prior probabilities are not given, let's assume equal priors for simplicity. The probabilities that we estimate will be based on the alignment of Adam's personality with typical characteristics of students in those fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in a particular field (assumed equal for simplicity),
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality if he is in that field,
- \( P(E) \): Marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality (a normalizing constant).

Since we are comparing only two fields, we can ignore the absolute normalization and focus on the relative likelihoods.

### Computer Science
Characteristics:
- High intelligence
- Good at abstract concepts
- Enjoy solving puzzles
Adam fits well with these characteristics as described in the personality sketch.

### Business Administration
Characteristics:
- Understanding of hard work and dedication can be relevant
- Empathy and warm-heartedness can be valuable
While empathy and understanding dedication fit, the alignment with curiosity in nature and solving puzzles is less direct compared to computer science.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) can be qualitatively estimated. 

So, let's estimate these:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- We'll normalize these probabilities for comparison.

Normalization:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.7}{0.7 + 0.3} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.7 + 0.3} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
