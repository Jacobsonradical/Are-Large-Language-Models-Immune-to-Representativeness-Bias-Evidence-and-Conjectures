To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given we do not have concrete numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the marginal probability \( P(E) \), we will need to make educated assumptions. 

We will assume that Adam's attributes as described in the personality sketch \( E \) (curiosity about nature, love for animals, skill in solving puzzles, high intelligence, etc.) are less likely to match the typical profile for business administration and more likely to match fields that require such intellectual and empathetic traits, such as computer science. 

1. **Business Administration**:
   - It is less typical for business administration students to have strong inclinations towards nature, animals, and problem-solving puzzles at a level requiring abstract understanding.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science students often require high intelligence and abstract reasoning skills. Interest in puzzles and problem-solving fits well with the computer science profile.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is high.

Without specific numerical values, an estimation approach will need to be qualitative.

Here is a very rough estimate based on this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are just indicative based on assumptions and reasoning about the likelihood of Adam's personality traits fitting these fields. In a real-world scenario, we would require actual statistical data to provide precise probabilities.
