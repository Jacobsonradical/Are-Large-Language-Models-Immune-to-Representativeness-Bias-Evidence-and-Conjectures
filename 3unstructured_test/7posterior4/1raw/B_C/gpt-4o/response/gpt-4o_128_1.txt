Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science and Business Administration, we would need specific numerical values for these probabilities, which are not provided. Instead, we will make reasoned approximations based on the available information about Adam's personality and interests.

### Analysis

Adam's love for nature, curiosity about plants, high intelligence, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals make him a unique candidate. Let's analyze each field:

1. **Computer Science**
   - **P(E|H)**: While Adam's ability to understand abstract concepts might align well with computer science, his quiet nature and love for plants and animals do not strongly correlate with the typical computer science field, which usually involves a lot of computer interaction and less nature-oriented activities.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular and common field, generally well-prioritized among graduate studies.

2. **Business Administration**
   - **P(E|H)**: Business Administration may require strong people-oriented skills, strategic thinking, and often a more extroverted or management-oriented personality. Adam's empathy and warm heart could be assets here, but his strong interest in nature and solving puzzles doesn't strongly align with what is traditionally required in business administration.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field, but perhaps slightly less so than computer science among certain graduate student populations.

Given these qualitative assessments, we might reason potential probabilities as follows, keeping in mind these are approximations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```

These values reflect the consideration that while Adamâ€™s abstract thinking is suitable for Computer Science, his strong emphases on nature, empathy, and animals might make this field less attractive. Business Administration might be less likely due to its general demand for more managerial and extroverted interactions. The provided values are subjective approximations based on available traits and should be validated with more data for precision.
