To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each given field (business administration or computer science) based on his personality sketch, we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Given we do not have explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or \( P(E) \), we will focus on the qualitative aspects to determine relative likelihoods.

**For business administration:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):
  Business administration doesn't strongly align with Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, and animals. The personality traits described do not strongly suggest a fit for typical business administration interests.

**For computer science:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \):
  Computer science aligns well with Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are often crucial for success in computer science.

Considering these qualitative assessments:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.

With this, we can infer that the posterior probability for Adam being in computer science is higher than for business administration.

Approximate posterior probabilities:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This assumes that the probabilities follow a pattern where computer science is notably more likely than business administration for someone with Adam's described traits. Note that these probabilities are illustrative and not computed from extensive data.
