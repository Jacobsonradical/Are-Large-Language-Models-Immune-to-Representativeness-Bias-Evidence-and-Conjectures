To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the evidence given each hypothesis. Bayes' Rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information in the question, we don't have the exact values for the priors \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Therefore, any numerical answer would have to be an educated guess based on the personality traits and how they align with the fields of computer science and business administration.

### Evaluating Likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Likely traits: Curiosity about nature (could translate into curiosity about technology), enjoys solving puzzles (important for algorithmic thinking), high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, appreciation for hard work.
    
    Based on these traits, it seems quite likely that Adam could be enrolled in computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likely traits: Appreciation for hard work and dedication, empathy (important for leadership roles), high intelligence.
    
    While some of Adam's traits are useful in business administration, not all strongly point towards this field as much as they do for computer science.

### Making Educated Guesses:

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign higher likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science compared to business administration.

#### Hypothetical Values:

We can hypothetically guess the following probabilities based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits with each field, noting that these are not exact but rather based on intuition:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are chosen to reflect a higher likelihood for computer science without exact priors and likelihoods. These are subjective evaluations based on the given personality sketch.
