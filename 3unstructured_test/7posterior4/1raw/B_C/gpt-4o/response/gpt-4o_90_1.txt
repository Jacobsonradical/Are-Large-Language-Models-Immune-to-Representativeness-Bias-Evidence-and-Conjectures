To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify our computations, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probabilities \( P(H) \). Additionally, we assume that:

1. The prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in business administration or computer science are equal unless evidence suggests otherwise.
2. The posterior probability will be influenced by how well Adam's characteristics match the typical profile of a student in each respective field.

### Nature and Plants:

- **Business Administration:** Likely less relevant. Assume a low \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).
- **Computer Science:** More relevant if nature-related projects or specializations are considered. Assume a moderate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \).

### Solving Puzzles:

- **Business Administration:** Could be relevant for strategy and analysis. Assume moderate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).
- **Computer Science:** Highly relevant, solving puzzles is a common activity. Assume high \( P(E|H_{CS}) \).

### Love for Animals and Empathy:

- **Business Administration:** Could be relevant for social entrepreneurship. Assume a low-to-moderate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).
- **Computer Science:** Less directly relevant; might come into play in specific fields like AI for social good. Assume a moderate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \).

### Intelligence and Understanding Abstract Concepts:

- **Business Administration:** Relevant for high-level strategic roles. Assume a moderate \( P(E|H_{BA}) \).
- **Computer Science:** Highly relevant to the field. Assume high \( P(E|H_{CS}) \).

### Posterior Probabilities

Using qualitative impressions for \( P(E|H) \) and assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity (\( P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{CS}) \)), let's assign and normalize:

1. **Business Administration \( H_{BA} \)**:
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \) (moderate relevance for most traits)
2. **Computer Science \( H_{CS} \)**:
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.7 \) (high relevance for problem-solving, abstract concepts)

Now we can compare:
- \( P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.7 \)

By normalizing (over just these two domains, assuming equal priors):

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.7} = \frac{0.3}{1} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.7}{0.3 + 0.7} = \frac{0.7}{1} = 0.7 \]

### Final Result

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note that these values are based on qualitative assessments, and real posteriors would require detailed statistical analysis of actual student characteristics in each program.
