To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field given the personality sketch \(E\) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). However, in the absence of specific data, we can make an educated guess based on the personality traits described. This method will involve qualitative reasoning rather than precise numerical computation.

Let's recap the relevant traits from the personality sketch \(E\):

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Computer Science**:
- Enjoying solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest a match with computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals are less directly aligned with this field, but they do not conflict.
- Curiosity about nature and plants is not typically associated with computer science but isn't a negative indicator either.

**Business Administration**:
- Warm-heartedness, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work fit well within business administration.
- Curiosity about nature and plants is less directly aligned with business administration.
- The enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts is also relevant but typically less emphasized compared to skills like leadership and operations management.

Based on these qualitative assessments, it seems more probable that Adam would be in a field that aligns closely with his specific pairing of traits: primarily high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking for Computer Science, and empathy, dedication, and appreciation of hard work for Business Administration.

Given these traits and without numerical specifics, the posterior probabilities can be qualitatively estimated:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

Here, we estimate a slightly higher probability for computer science due to the clear alignment of specific critical traits such as puzzle-solving and abstract thinking with that field. However, the strong appreciation for hard work, empathy, and dedication make business administration still a reasonably likely field, hence the non-negligible 0.4 estimate.
