To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know more than just the personality sketch of Adam. Specifically, we would need:

1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis (before considering the personality sketch).
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. Evidence \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the actual probabilities, we need to rely on reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

### Assumptions

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - We assume that graduate students are evenly distributed among different fields, although in practice, some fields might have higher or lower enrollment. For simplicity, let's assume:
     - \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (Computer science is a popular field among graduate students)
     - \( P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.15 \) (Business administration is also common but slightly less so)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Based on Adam's personality:
     - He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, which might be less relevant to both computer science and business administration but suggests a potential interest in scientific disciplines.
     - He enjoys solving puzzles, a trait strongly associated with computer science.
     - His empathy, warm heart, and love for animals might suggest fields like biology or veterinary science more strongly than business administration.
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts also align well with computer science.

     Let's assume these distributions:
     - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \) (Given his puzzle-solving skills and intelligence, stronger fit with computer science)
     - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (Given his traits are less related to business skills)

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**
   - This is the total probability of the evidence and can be computed by considering all possible fields, but for simplicity, we'll assume it normalizes the probabilities.

### Approximate Posterior Probabilities

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in both cases, it cancels out in the comparison:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{P(E)} \]

To normalize:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)} \]

Let's normalize the values:
Total = \( 0.08 + 0.015 = 0.095 \)

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.095} \approx 0.842 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.095} \approx 0.158 \]

So, approximately:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.842,
  "business administration": 0.158
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science than in business administration.
