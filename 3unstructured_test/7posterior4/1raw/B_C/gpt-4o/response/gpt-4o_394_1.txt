To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity and given the lack of specific numerical data for priors and likelihoods, we will make some reasoned assumptions based on common knowledge and the personality sketch provided for Adam.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.

We'll assume that the likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in either business administration or computer science is relatively common. For simplicity, we can assign subjective probability values based on common enrollments, which could be \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \) and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \). 

### Likelihood For Each Field Given E
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The probability of exhibiting Adam's personality characteristics given that he is studying business administration. Considering his traits, this likelihood might be lower as business administration typically might attract students with a more people-centric or strategic-type personality, not necessarily involved with nature or solving puzzles.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): The probability of exhibiting Adam's personality characteristics given that he is studying computer science. This fits better due to his problem-solving skills, love of puzzles, and abstract-thinking abilities.

We can reasonably assume the following likelihood values:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \)

### Evidence Probability
\( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's traits universally, which combines all possible fields he might be in, but since we primarily care about our specific fields of business administration and computer science, simplifying across these, we need not calculate an exact value.

### Posterior Probabilities
Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common to both calculations, it serves as a normalizing factor and cancels out when comparing across choices. Thus, we can ignore it for a relative comparison:

\[ \text{Relative comparison for business administration:} = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Relative comparison for computer science:} = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18 \]

### Normalized Posterior
Given that we only need the posterior probabilities in relation to the two fields, we normalize:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.02}{0.20} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.02 + 0.18} = \frac{0.18}{0.20} = 0.9 \]

Thus, the final posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.9
}
```
