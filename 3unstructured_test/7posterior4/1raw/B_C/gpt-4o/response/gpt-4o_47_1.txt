To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, specific values for these probabilities (\( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \)) are not provided in the question. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given about Adam's personality, interests, and time frame.

1. **Business Administration**: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he does not particularly possess traits that strongly align with typical characteristics of business students, such as leadership, interest in economics, or management skills. His empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature lean more toward fields like environmental studies or biology rather than business.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with traits often found in computer science students. Computers and technology often involve solving logical puzzles and abstract thinking.

Therefore, qualitatively, the probability of Adam being in business administration should be lower than the probability of him being in computer science. If we were to make an educated guess based on his profile, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Note: These values are subjective and based on a qualitative assessment. The actual computation of these probabilities would require specifics on the likelihood of each field given the provided personality traits and base rates (prior probabilities) of students in each field in 2021.
