To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field \(P(H)\) and the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given that field \(P(E|H)\). While we won't have specific numerical values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods without additional data, we can make some qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where: 
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\).

Considering the personality sketch of Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- He has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

Based on this information:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science often involves solving abstract puzzles and requires high intelligence.
   - There isn't a direct mention of interests in computational or technical fields in the sketch.
   - Still, the problem-solving aspect aligns well with computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business Administration involves understanding abstract concepts but more from a management and human relations perspective than a purely intellectual one.
   - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work can align with the skills required in business management.
   - However, there's no direct mention of interest in business or management in the sketch.

Based on these considerations, we might reasonably conclude the following rough approximations for the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Please note that these values are qualitative estimates rather than precise calculations, given we don't have specific priors and likelihoods.
