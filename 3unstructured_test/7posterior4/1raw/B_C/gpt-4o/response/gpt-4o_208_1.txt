To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities and likelihood values, I will estimate the values based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The likelihood that someone in business administration has Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work) is relatively low. Business administration students are typically not characterized by these traits strongly, although there could be some overlap.
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration can be considered moderate since it's a common graduate field.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): The likelihood that someone in computer science has Adam's characteristics is higher. The fields of computer science often attract individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): The prior probability of Adam being in computer science can also be considered moderate to high, as computer science is a popular field among graduate students who possess the traits described.

Given these considerations, let's estimate the posterior probabilities.

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}} | E) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \approx 0.5 \]

These are rough estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics found in these fields. They are not derived from precise statistical data but are instead informed by general knowledge of these fields.

Please adjust the probabilities based on more detailed priors and likelihoods if available.
