To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence E given that hypothesis H is true.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence E.

Given that we don't have specific numerical values, we'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the description of Adam.

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)
Let's qualitatively evaluate \(P(E|H)\) for each hypothesis:
1. **Business Administration**: 
   - Interests: Business administration typically involves interests in management, finance, and leadership. Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals don't strongly align with these fields.
   - Cognitive traits: While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial in business, Adam's empathic and warm-hearted nature, along with his love for nature, are less indicative of a business administration field.
   - Likelihood: Moderately low.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - Interests: While direct interest in nature and animals doesn't point to computer science, Adamâ€™s enjoyment of solving puzzles is a strong indicator. 
   - Cognitive traits: High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align very well with computer science.
   - Likelihood: Moderately high.

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)
For the sake of this analysis, assume that there is no significant difference in the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) since these probabilities depend on the distribution of graduate students across fields, which isn't provided.

### Overall Probability \(P(E)\)
Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both hypotheses and our priors are reasonably uniform, the comparison between these fields will primarily depend on the likelihoods.

Combining these evaluations qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Low likelihood given Adam's traits and interests.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Higher likelihood due to alignment with problem-solving skills, intelligence, and interest in abstract concepts.
