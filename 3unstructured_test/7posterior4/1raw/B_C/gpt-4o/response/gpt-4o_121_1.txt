Applying Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study requires knowledge of the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of his personality sketch given that he is enrolled in those fields. However, without concrete data on these priors and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative estimate based on the description provided.

### Step 1: Prior Knowledge
We would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being in business administration and computer science, respectively. Since we don't have these priors, we'll assume they are somewhat equally likely among possible fields of study.

### Step 2: Likelihood of E Given H
We'll assess the likelihood of Adam having his personality sketch \( E \) based on the field hypothesis \( H \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - A graduate student in business administration typically focuses on leadership, management, economics, and business strategy, which may not necessarily align with characteristics like a love for nature, puzzles, and animals. It seems less likely compared to computer science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - A graduate student in computer science often deals with abstract thinking, problem-solving (aligning with solving puzzles), and might have interests in fields like biology (computational biology) or environmental science (eco-informatics), which can include a genuine curiosity about nature.

### Step 3: Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given no specific numerical priors or likelihoods, we'll make a qualitative estimate:

1. **Business Administration**: We'd estimate a lower probability based on Adam's described interests and traits.
2. **Computer Science**: We'd estimate a higher probability given the alignment with his characteristics.

### Qualitative Estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates reflecting that Adamâ€™s personality sketch seems more consistent with someone studying computer science than business administration. Other fields that could align well with Adam's description (e.g., biology, environmental science) are not included but would impact a complete assessment.
