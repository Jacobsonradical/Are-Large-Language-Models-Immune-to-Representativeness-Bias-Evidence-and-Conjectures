To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make some assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in any specific field, is initially assumed to be equal for all graduate fields of study.
2. \( P(E) \), the probability of the evidence being observed, is a normalizing factor.
3. \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given the field of study, is qualitatively estimated based on the clues in the sketch.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods as follows:

- For **Computer Science**:
  - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts support this hypothesis.
  - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with computer science.
  - Curiosity about nature and animals is less directly related but doesn't exclude it.

Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be fairly high for Computer Science.

- For **Business Administration**:
  - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication support this hypothesis.
  - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and puzzle solving do not clearly correlate with business administration.

Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be somewhat lower for Business Administration.

Given these qualitative estimates, we'll compute as follows:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{cs}} \propto P(E|\text{cs}) \cdot P(\text{cs}) \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{ba}} \propto P(E|\text{ba}) \cdot P(\text{ba}) \]

Assuming \( P(\text{cs}) = P(\text{ba}) \), we simplify to compare \( P(E|\text{cs}) \) and \( P(E|\text{ba}) \).

1. Let's say \( P(E|\text{cs}) \) is high, say 0.7.
2. Let's say \( P(E|\text{ba}) \) is lower, say 0.3.

So, the posterior probabilities, qualitatively estimated, may be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Please note that these values are heuristic estimates and would require actual data for precise computation.
