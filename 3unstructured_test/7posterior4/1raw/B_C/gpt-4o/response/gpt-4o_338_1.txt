To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in computer science and business administration, we would use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \). Instead, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the description given.

From Adam's personality sketch, we can infer the following:
- He has a curiosity about nature and enjoys solving puzzles.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has empathy and loves animals.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

For computer science:
- Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with the field of computer science, which often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
- High intelligence also supports success in computer science.
- However, the interest in nature and love for animals, while not strictly opposed to computer science, are not directly relevant.

For business administration:
- Empathy and understanding the value of hard work can be beneficial in business administration, particularly in areas like human resources or management.
- High intelligence is a generic positive trait for many fields, including business administration.
- However, the specific traits of curiosity about nature and solving puzzles are less directly related to business administration.

Qualitatively, the personality traits seem more aligned with computer science, especially given the enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking. 

Thus, based on this qualitative assessment, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are provided as educated guesses based on the personality sketch and should be interpreted accordingly, not as definitive numerical probabilities.
