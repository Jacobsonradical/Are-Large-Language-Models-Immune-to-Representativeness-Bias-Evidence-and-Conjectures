To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., whether Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration), we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The base rate of students in each field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam’s personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in that field.
3. **Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and we're only looking for relative probabilities here, we'll compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for both fields directly without normalizing.

We’ll make some reasonable assumptions to estimate these values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Suppose \( P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H = \text{business administration}) = 0.15 \), based on general enrollment statistics for graduate studies in the U.S.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Based on Adam’s traits, he seems more aligned with fields that value strong intelligence, abstract thinking, empathy, and appreciation for dedication. Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|H = \text{computer science}) = 0.6 \)
     - \( P(E|H = \text{business administration}) = 0.3 \)

Using these assumptions, we can compute the following:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H = \text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|H = \text{computer science}) \cdot P(H = \text{computer science}) \]
\[ = 0.6 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ = 0.15 \]

For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H = \text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|H = \text{business administration}) \cdot P(H = \text{business administration}) \]
\[ = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ = 0.045 \]

The values here show relative weightings but aren't normalized probabilities. To normalize these:

\[ P(H = \text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.045} \approx 0.769 \]
\[ P(H = \text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.15 + 0.045} \approx 0.231 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.769,
  "business administration": 0.231
}
```

These figures suggest that given Adam’s personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in a computer science program compared to a business administration program.
