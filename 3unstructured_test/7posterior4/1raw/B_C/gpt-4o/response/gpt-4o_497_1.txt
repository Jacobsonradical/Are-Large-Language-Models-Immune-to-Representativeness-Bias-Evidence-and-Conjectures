To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probabilities of the hypotheses. However, since we do not have concrete numerical values for these likelihoods and priors, we have to make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will largely focus on the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and the characteristics typically associated with different fields.

**Estimation Process:**

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typically involves skills in leadership, management, finance, marketing, and a general outgoing personality.
   - Not a perfect match for Adam, who is described as quiet, empathetic, and curious about nature.
   - Prior likelihood \( P(H) \): Low to moderate.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, given the mismatch in interests and traits.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Involves logical thinking, problem-solving skills, understanding abstract concepts, and often, an appreciation for working quietly and independently.
   - Matches well with Adam's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Prior likelihood \( P(H) \): Moderate to high.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, given the close alignment with Adam's traits.

Here are the qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

**Note:** These values are not derived from precise calculations but are qualitatively reasoned based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Ideally, more specific data about the priors and likelihoods would refine these estimates.
