To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \), we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihoods:

### Computer Science
Factors supporting enrollment in computer science (CS):
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts

Factors not particularly aligned:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Deep love for animals

### Business Administration
Factors supporting enrollment in business administration:
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication
- Empathy and warm heart (useful in fields like human resources or management)

Factors not particularly aligned:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet disposition (less aligned with the often interpersonal demands of business settings)

Given the qualitative nature of the assessment and the alignment of traits with each field, it seems more likely that Adam is associated with a field that aligns closely with abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, such as computer science, rather than business administration. Thus, we might estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

This is a qualitative estimation and should be interpreted accordingly, giving higher weight to computer science due to Adam's affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
