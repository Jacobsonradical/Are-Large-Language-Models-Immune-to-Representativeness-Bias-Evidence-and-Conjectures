To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, exact computations are difficult. Instead, we can reason qualitatively to provide an estimate based on the personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - While Adam's personality traits include high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work, his interests and empathy for nature, animals, and puzzles suggest a lower probability of him enrolling in Business Administration, which might not align directly with his passions and characteristics.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has a high intelligence, and understands abstract concepts. These traits highly align with the skills and interests required for the field of Computer Science. Additionally, his curiosity and problem-solving abilities suggest a strong fit for this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, the approximate posterior probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

This is just an estimation based on the provided personality traits and reasoning about the likely alignment of those traits with the respective fields.
