To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of study (business administration and computer science) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for the characteristics described in E given these fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of this question, since we don't have the actual values for the priors and likelihoods, we will conceptually assess the probabilities based on the characteristics given in the personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge about these fields.

### Analysis

1. **Business Administration:**
   - People in this field typically focus on management, finance, marketing, and other business-centric topics.
   - The described traits of curiosity about nature, quiet demeanor, strong empathy, love for animals, and abstract thinking are less characteristic of business administration students, though not completely exclusive to them.
   
   Based on this, we would assign a relatively low likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - This field often attracts individuals with high intelligence and good abstract reasoning skills.
   - Puzzle solving is also a common trait among computer science students.
   - However, the strong empathy and love for animals are not typical indicators but not entirely exclusive either.
   
   This profile matches more closely with computer science students, suggesting a higher \( P(E|H) \) for this field compared to business administration but not maximally high due to some less-relevant traits.

### Posterior Probabilities

Let's hypothesize plausible probabilities without exact numerical values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This rough estimate means that given Adam's personality sketch, we're more likely to think he's in computer science than in business administration, though the absolute certainty isn't high due to the mixed nature of the traits. For precise values, actual data regarding students from these fields would be required.
