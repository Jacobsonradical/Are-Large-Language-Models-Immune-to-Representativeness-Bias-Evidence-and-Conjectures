Bayes' rule is given by the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll make reasonable assumptions about \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \): The base rate of students being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of anyone having Adam's personality sketch.

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we'll make qualitative assumptions based on the description of Adam and the nature of the fields:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is described as intelligent, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts well. These traits align well with the skills needed in computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_1) \) should be relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While business administration may require intelligence and appreciation for hard work, it's less directly aligned with Adam's noted curiosity about nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_2) \) might be lower compared to computer science.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(H_1) \) (prior probability of being in computer science): 0.25
- \( P(H_2) \) (prior probability of being in business administration): 0.20
- \( P(E|H_1) \): 0.70 (given his traits are well-suited for computer science)
- \( P(E|H_2) \): 0.30 (given his traits are less aligned with business administration)
- \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and doesn’t need to be explicitly computed to compare relative probabilities.

Using these assumptions, we can apply Bayes' rule qualitatively to arrive at:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.70 \cdot 0.25 = 0.175 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.30 \cdot 0.20 = 0.060 \]

Normalizing (if we wanted total probability to sum to 1 for these two hypotheses only):

\[
\text{Total} = 0.175 + 0.060 = 0.235
\]
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.175}{0.235} \approx 0.745
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.060}{0.235} \approx 0.255
\]

For simplicity, not normalizing, and to adhere to the requested format:

{
  "computer science": 0.175,
  "business administration": 0.060
}
