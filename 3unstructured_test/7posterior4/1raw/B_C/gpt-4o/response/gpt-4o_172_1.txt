In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide accurate values for these probabilities, we would need numerical data or prior distributions, which aren't provided in the sketch. Instead, I'll provide qualitative insights based on the given personality sketch and typical field characteristics.

1. **Business Administration**: This field often attracts individuals who are interested in leadership, management, finance, economics, and organizational behavior. While empathy is beneficial in this field, Adamâ€™s deep curiosity about nature, love for puzzles, and appreciation for hard work seem less directly aligned with the business administration's core interests and activities.

2. **Computer Science**: This field typically attracts individuals who have a strong interest in problem-solving, logical thinking, and often, abstract concepts. Adam's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and capability to understand abstract concepts align well with the skill set required in computer science. Additionally, his empathy and warm heart can be beneficial in fields like human-computer interaction or AI focusing on ethical aspects and user-centered design.

Given these insights, here's a qualitative estimate:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}

These values are based on the qualitative match between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements or characteristics of these fields. Without concrete numerical data, these are plausible estimates based on the provided personality sketch.
