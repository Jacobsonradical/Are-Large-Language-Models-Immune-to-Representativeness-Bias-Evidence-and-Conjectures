To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the relevant factors for both prior probabilities and likelihood. However, without explicit numeric values for these factors, we'll rely on a qualitative analysis.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if Adam was enrolled in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) remains the same across fields for comparative purposes.

Qualitatively:
- For computer science: Considering Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for solving puzzles, and interest in abstract concepts, it aligns well with a computer science background.
- For business administration: Given Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and lack of direct references to interest in economic theories or corporate structures, this field seems less aligned.

Let's estimate:

\( P(E| \text{computer science}) \): High
\( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Prior probability is moderate to high because CS is a common field.

\( P(E| \text{business administration}) \): Moderate to low
\( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Prior probability might be lower given the traits described.

Assuming:
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \) and \( P(E| \text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Normalizing considering the qualitative context:

- For computer science: Given \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \), we estimate \( P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21 \).
- For business administration: Given \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \), we estimate \( P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \).

Thus:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.21",
  "business administration": "0.02"
}
```

Keep in mind these values are qualitative estimates, not precise probabilities.
