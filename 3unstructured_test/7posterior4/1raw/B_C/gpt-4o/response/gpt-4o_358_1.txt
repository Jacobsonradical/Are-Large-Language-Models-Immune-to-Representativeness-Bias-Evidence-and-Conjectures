To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

However, since we don't have the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), this task requires making qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch. 

Adam's personality traits and interests can guide our assessments:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: May not directly correlate with either field but has nuances that could be explored in computer science through artificial intelligence in agriculture or bioinformatics.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: This trait strongly correlates with computer science.
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, loves animals: While more aligned with behavioral sciences or biology, it doesn't strongly align with business administration.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Strongly aligns with computer science.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: This can be relevant to both fields.

On these qualitative assessments, we can surmise the following conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

The value for business administration is lower as traits such as empathy and a love for animals are less characteristic of this field. Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts have a stronger correlation with computer science, hence the higher likelihood for this field.
