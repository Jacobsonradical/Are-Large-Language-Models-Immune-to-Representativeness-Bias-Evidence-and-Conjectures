To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, we lack specific prior probabilities and likelihoods in this context, so we can't compute precise numerical values. Instead, we can reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch and the general nature of the fields.

Adam's personality traits include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, we can make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles suggests a compatibility with computer science, as it often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking.
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also align with computer science fields.
   - However, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy might be less directly related to this field.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart could be beneficial in understanding organizational behavior and human resource management.
   - However, this field may not directly align with his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals, unless he is specifically interested in industries related to these areas (e.g., environmental sustainability, organic product businesses).

Given this qualitative reasoning, we can hypothesize:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are speculative and based on the qualitative fit between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics of these academic fields.
