To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and normalize by the total probability \( P(E) \). Unfortunately, we don't have explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods for these fields and personality traits. 

Thus, I must rely on reasonable assumptions based on the given information and common/statistical correlations between personality traits and fields of study.

Given Adam's personality sketch, let's try to estimate:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Generally, this field values leadership, business acumen, and social skills.
   - Adam is described as having a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Traits such as a quiet personality and interest in nature/plants are not explicitly aligning with typical business administration traits but aren't exclusive either.
   
   Assumed likelihood estimate: 0.3

2. **Computer Science**:
   - This field highly values problem-solving skills, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and quiet demeanor align well with the field of computer science.
   
   Assumed likelihood estimate: 0.7

These estimates are based on the descriptions and the alignment of Adam's traits with typical characteristics valued in these fields.

Thus, by these assumptions:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note that these are subjective estimates based on provided personality information and typical field characteristics. For rigorously computed probabilities, extensive statistical data would be required for accurate priors and likelihoods.
