To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that the description E matches someone in that field, and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \). We apply Bayes' rule as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the exact numerical probabilities are not given, so we'll have to rely on qualitative reasoning about the subject's traits and their alignment with typical candidates in each field. 

1. **Business Administration:**
    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field among graduate students, so let's assume a higher prior probability.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The traits described (nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, abstract concepts) do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics (financial acumen, management, communication).
    - Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low for business administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is also a common field among graduate students, assuming a similarly high prior probability.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The subject's interest in puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts strongly align with typical traits found in computer science students.
    - Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high for computer science.

Based on the qualitative reasoning, here are the probabilistic estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Business Administration (P(H|E) = 0.1)**: The traits of Adam do not strongly align with what one typically finds in business administration students.
- **Computer Science (P(H|E) = 0.6)**: The subject's traits align well with those typically found in computer science students, making this hypothesis more probable given E.
