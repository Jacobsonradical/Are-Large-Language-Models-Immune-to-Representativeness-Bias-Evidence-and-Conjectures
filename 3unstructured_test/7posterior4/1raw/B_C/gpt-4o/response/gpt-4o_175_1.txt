To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we use the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can't compute exact numeric values. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

### Assessment Logic:
- **Business Administration**:
  - While business administration involves understanding abstract concepts, it usually doesn't have a primary focus on nature, animals, or puzzles.
  - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work might be relevant, but the absence of a focus on nature or animals is a significant mismatch.
  - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are not strongly relevant to this field.

Hence, the posterior probability for business administration would be relatively low.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Computer science requires understanding abstract concepts and problem-solving, both of which align with Adam's skills.
  - High intelligence and the ability to solve puzzles are strong indicators for a good fit in this field.
  - Curiosity about nature and empathy might play into areas like bioinformatics or creating software related to environmental conservation.

Thus, the posterior probability for computer science would be relatively higher compared to business administration.

Given these considerations, while not providing exact numbers, we qualitatively state that the probability for computer science is higher than for business administration.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimated to reflect the mismatch for business administration and the relative suitability of computer science based on the profile provided for Adam, acknowledging that these are heuristic judgments in the absence of more specific probability data.
