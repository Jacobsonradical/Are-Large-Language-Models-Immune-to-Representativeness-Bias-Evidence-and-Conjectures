To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we have to make reasonable assumptions based on general impressions and heuristics.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(E|H)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
   - **Computer Science (CS)**: Adam's personality traits, such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills, are reasonably common in the field.
   - **Business Administration (BA)**: Traits like empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work are beneficial but less directly aligned with the stereotypical skills for this field compared to CS.

2. **P(H)**: Prior probability of enrolling in a specific field.
   - For simplicity, let's assume equal priors as there is no strong indication otherwise.

3. **P(E)**: Probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of his field.
   - This can be considered a normalizing constant and will cancel out when comparing the conditional probabilities for the two fields.

Given these assumptions, we can make heuristic estimates for \( P(E|H) \). 

- **P(E|CS)**: Let's assume a value around 0.6.
- **P(E|BA)**: Let's assume a value around 0.3.

Assuming equal prior probabilities (which we can denote as \( P(CS) = P(BA) = 0.5 \)):

### Calculation:
\[
P(CS|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(BA|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and serves as a normalizing factor that will be the same for both fields, we can just compare the numerators:

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(CS|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(BA|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

To get probabilities that sum to 1 when we only have these two options:

\[
\text{Normalization factor} = 0.3 + 0.15 = 0.45
\]

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.45} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

\[
P(BA|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.45} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

Please note that these are heuristic values, not exact probabilities. Further data could refine these estimates.
