To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need information about prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of the personality sketch given each field (\( P(E|H) \)). However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities or data on the likelihood, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don’t have the exact prior probabilities or the likelihood values, we can infer some qualitative likelihood based on the details in the personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which are traits that align well with computer science.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles, which is a common activity in the field of computer science.
   - No direct mention of technology or computers, but the puzzle-solving trait is strong in this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which is relevant to business administration.
   - However, traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not typically aligned with business studies.
   - Business administration often values leadership and social interaction, and the sketch emphasizes Adam’s quiet nature more.

Given these inferred likelihoods, we can make some educated guesses about the probabilities:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Here, we assume that the personality sketch fits better with traits commonly found in computer science professionals than those in business administration. Note that this is a qualitative estimation and may not reflect actual probabilities due to the lack of specific data.
