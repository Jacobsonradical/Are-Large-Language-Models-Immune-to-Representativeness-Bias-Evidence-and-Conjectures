To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to give a precise numerical answer, we need the following information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having his described personality traits given that he is in each specific field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam having his described personality traits (which would be the same for both fields in this context and hence acts as a normalizing constant).

Given that we do not have specific values for these probabilities and assuming we do not have contextual information to derive them, we will need to make some educated estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Adam's personality sketch suggests a curiosity about nature, an affinity for solving puzzles, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and empathy, which might make him more aligned with computer science due to the strong emphasis on problem-solving and abstract thinking.

For business administration, while empathy and appreciation for hard work can be relevant, the traits of curiosity about plants and love for animals are not as directly applicable.

Given these considerations, we can qualitatively estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field and apply it to get a rough comparative posterior probability.

Here's a qualitative approximation:

{
  "business administration": 0.2,  // less alignment with his personality traits
  "computer science": 0.6  // more alignment with his personality traits
}

Please remember, these are very rough estimates made for the sake of answering the question without precise prior and likelihood data. These values could be adjusted with more specific probabilistic data.
