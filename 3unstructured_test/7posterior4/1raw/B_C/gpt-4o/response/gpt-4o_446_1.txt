To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, let's outline the general steps needed even though exact numeric answers will require assumptions or external data.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch across all fields.

Without explicit data, we can provide an informal reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch and likely fields of study:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy) are generally less aligned with business traits, which often focus on leadership, management, and finance.
   - Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts can be useful in business, but it's not the primary focus.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and high intelligence are highly correlated with success in computer science.
   - Empathy and a love for animals are not typical markers, but they don't preclude involvement in computer science either.

Considering these observations qualitatively:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \text{ is relatively low}
\]
\[
P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \text{ is relatively high}
\]

Assigning plausible estimates while acknowledging the hypothetical nature, the probabilities might look like:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)}
\]

Without precise values, this would likely yield a small number due to the lower likelihood.

\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}
\]

This would likely yield a higher value due to the higher alignment of traits.

Given qualitative reasoning and for illustrative purposes, possible (though not data-backed) numbers might be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05, 
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are illustrative of the trend, not precise calculations, and are based on the qualitative fit of \text{E} with common traits for these fields.
