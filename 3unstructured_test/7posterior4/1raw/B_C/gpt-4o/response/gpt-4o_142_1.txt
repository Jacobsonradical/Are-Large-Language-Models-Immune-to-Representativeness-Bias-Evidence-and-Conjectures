To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence and the prior probability of each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E) \), we must make educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided and the typical profiles of students in the respective fields.

For the fields of computer science and business administration, I will estimate the probabilities based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical traits and interests associated with these fields.

### Computer Science (CS)
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the cognitive demands of computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits well with the problem-solving nature of studying computer science.
- However, the strong empathy and love for animals, while not irrelevant, are less directly related to the typical characteristics of computer science students.

### Business Administration (BA)
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication are crucial traits in business administration.
- Strong empathy and people skills can be very beneficial in management and business environments.
- However, the focus on nature, plants, and animals is less directly aligned with business administration.

Based on these considerations, Adamâ€™s traits seem to align more closely with computer science than business administration.

Here are the approximate posterior probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values suggest that it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science, but there is still a significant probability that he could have been in business administration, given his appreciation for dedication and strong empathy.
