To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to rely on the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, i.e., the probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Given that we do not have exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we need to make educated guesses based on the personality sketch E and general knowledge about the fields in question.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam’s traits such as high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving skills align well with computer science. Also, quiet and introspective personalities are common in this field.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular graduate field in the U.S., so the prior probability can be considered moderate to high.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Although empathy and a warm heart can be valuable in business administration, Adam’s strong focus on nature and animals, as well as puzzle-solving and quiet personality, are less aligned with typical business administration roles, which often require strong social interaction and leadership.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is also a popular graduate field, but given the mismatch with Adam's introspective and nature-focused traits, the prior probability could be lower than that for computer science.

Making these qualitative judgments and given that exact values are not provided, we can assign approximate probabilities based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values represent the likelihood that Adam’s personality traits fit the respective fields, based on a reasoned approach to the information given.
