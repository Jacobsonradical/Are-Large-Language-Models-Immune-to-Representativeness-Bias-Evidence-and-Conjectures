To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to incorporate the given personality sketch (E) and our hypotheses about Adam's field of study.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have explicit values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we will make educated estimates based on the personality traits and interests given in the personality sketch.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, intelligence, and enjoyment in solving puzzles, we will consider these factors in relation to the hypotheses.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration might require strong empathy and intelligence but doesn't directly align with curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, or specific interests in solving puzzles and abstract concepts.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Computer Science aligns well with intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts. However, the strong curiosity about nature and love for animals doesn't directly correlate with this field, even though it's not entirely unrelated.

Let's assign some rough probabilities based on logical inference:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, because the personality traits less directly align.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Medium to high, because of the fit with problem-solving and abstract concepts.

Assuming a roughly equal prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the number of possible fields.
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx \frac{1}{n} \).

Since specific values for \( P(E) \) are not provided, we will simplify this argument to qualitative analysis. 

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

- **Business Administration**: Low probability because the specific traits do not strongly align with this area.
- **Computer Science**: Higher probability due to the alignment with problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.
