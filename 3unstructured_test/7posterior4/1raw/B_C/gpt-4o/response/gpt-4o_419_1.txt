To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field, we apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the prior probability of the evidence.

However, since we do not have specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll have to make some qualitative estimations based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Assumptions

1. **P(H: Business Administration)**:
   - Adam's traits such as strong empathy, a warm heart, and appreciation for hard work could align with Business Administration, especially in areas like human resources or ethical leadership.
   - However, traits such as a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might not align well with a typical Business Administration focus.

2. **P(H: Computer Science)**:
   - Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, these traits are highly relevant to Computer Science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles is a common trait in Computer Science students.
   - Curious nature and love for animals might not be as directly aligned but do not necessarily conflict with a Computer Science focus.

### Estimations

- **Likelihood of Evidence Given Business Administration** (\( P(E|H_{business}) \)):
  - Quiet, empathetic, and warm-hearted but less focus on nature and animals: Moderate to low.

- **Likelihood of Evidence Given Computer Science** (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \)):
  - High intelligence, abstract reasoning, puzzle-solving, moderate empathy, and curiosity: High.

- **Prior Probability of Hypothesis** (\( P(H) \)) for each field:
  - Business Administration might have a lower baseline probability for these specific traits compared to Computer Science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we'll estimate the relative conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values suggest that given the personality sketch E, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in Computer Science than Business Administration. Note that these are rough estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise numerical data.
