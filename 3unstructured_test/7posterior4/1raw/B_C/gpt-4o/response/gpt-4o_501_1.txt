To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need more specific prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, I can provide a conceptual approach to how you might think about these values based on the personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence, aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest he might have a natural affinity for fields that require these skills. Also, computer science often involves problem-solving and abstract thinking. 
   
2. **Business Administration**: Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication might be useful in a business context. However, his interests in nature, plants, and animals, along with his high intelligence and preference for solving puzzles, might lean away from business administration unless it's in a context that incorporates these interests.

Given that we do not have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, we might make a qualitative judgment based on his profile:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities are based on the assumption that Adam's personality characteristics align more closely with a field like computer science rather than business administration. However, these values are quite subjective and should be adjusted if specific priors or more detailed context about Adam or the general distribution of students in those fields are known.
