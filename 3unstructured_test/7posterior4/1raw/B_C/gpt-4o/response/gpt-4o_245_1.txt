To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we would ideally need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in that field of study.

Bayesâ€™ rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \) and can be computed by summing over all possible fields:

\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

However, without concrete data, we can make educated guesses based on assumptions. Here's how we might reason about this given the personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically values leadership, strategic thinking, and financial acumen. While those pursuing this field can certainly appreciate nature and animals, the given traits of quietness, empathy, and a deep love for animals are less directly aligned with the core skills of business administration. Therefore, the posterior probability for this can be low.

2. **Computer Science**: This field often attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles, have high intelligence, and enjoy abstract concepts. Given Adam's traits of enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, as well as high intelligence, this field seems more aligned with his personality.

Let's assume some reasonable prior probabilities: 

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.2 \)
- Other fields, splitting the remaining 0.7

Now, estimate the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \) (assuming less alignment)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.7 \) (assuming more alignment)

Then, estimating the normalizer \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 + \text{(terms for other fields)} \]

Assuming the contributions from other fields sum to 0.5:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.14 + 0.5 = 0.66 \]

Now we compute:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{0.66} \approx 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.66} \approx 0.21 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be given approximately as:

{
  "business administration": "0.03",
  "computer science": "0.21"
}

These values are approximate and based on assumed priors and likelihoods. Accurate computation would require specific data and more precise likelihoods and priors.
