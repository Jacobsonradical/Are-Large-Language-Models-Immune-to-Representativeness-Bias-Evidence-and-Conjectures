To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can't compute exact probabilities. Instead, we can make qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch and likely fit to the fields of study.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable traits in computer science.
   - His enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of the field.
   - However, his deep love for nature and animals is less directly aligned with computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration often involves interpersonal interactions, leadership, and management skills.
   - While Adam's warm heart and strong empathy could be advantageous, the personality sketch does not emphasize traits typically associated with business administration (e.g., interest in economics, leadership).
   - Additionally, his curiosity about nature and solving puzzles is less directly related to this field.

Based on the qualitative fit, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the better alignment of Adam's personality traits with computer science as opposed to business administration.
