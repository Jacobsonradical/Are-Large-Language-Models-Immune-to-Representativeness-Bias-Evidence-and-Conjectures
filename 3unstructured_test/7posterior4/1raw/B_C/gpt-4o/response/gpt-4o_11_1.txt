To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in Computer Science or Business Administration given the personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, specific numerical values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and evidence probabilities \( P(E) \) are not provided. However, we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate these values.

### Computer Science
1. **Evidence Alignment (\( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \))**: Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with the skills needed in computer science.
2. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \))**: A relatively high number of graduate students are enrolled in computer science in the U.S.

Given the alignment of Adam's traits with computer science, we estimate a moderately high likelihood.

### Business Administration
1. **Evidence Alignment (\( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \))**: Adam's personality traits such as empathy and understanding of dedication could be beneficial in business administration. However, his specific interests in nature and solving puzzles are less directly aligned with typical business administration characteristics.
2. **Prior Probability (\( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \))**: Business administration is a common graduate field.

Given the only partial alignment of Adam's traits with business administration, we estimate a lower likelihood compared to computer science.

Without numerical data but based on qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These are qualitative estimates suggesting Adam is more likely to be in a field like computer science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
