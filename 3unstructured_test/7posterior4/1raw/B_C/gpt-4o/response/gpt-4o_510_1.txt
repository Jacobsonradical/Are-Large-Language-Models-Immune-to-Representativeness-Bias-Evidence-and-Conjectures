{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Explanation:
To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we consider the fit of Adam's personality traits with typical profiles of students in those fields. Given his high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, understanding of abstract concepts, and quiet nature, he's more likely to fit the profile of a computer science student, hence the higher probability assigned.

On the other hand, while some traits such as appreciation for hard work and dedication might align with business administration, other traits like a deep love for animals and a quiet disposition seem less characteristic of typical business students, resulting in a lower probability for business administration.

The exact values are educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided and the typical characteristics of students in each field.
