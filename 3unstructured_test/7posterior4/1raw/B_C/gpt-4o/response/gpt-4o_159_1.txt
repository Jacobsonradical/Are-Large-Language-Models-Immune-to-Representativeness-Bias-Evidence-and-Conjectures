To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide these probabilities accurately, we need some additional context or data such as:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch (E).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which denotes the probability of having Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which is the overall probability of having Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and the information provided in the personality sketch. 

Let's assign some reasonable values qualitatively:

- \( P(E|H) \) for "computer science": Likely high, given the traits of high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
- \( P(E|H) \) for "business administration": Likely moderate to low, as the personality traits described do not strongly align with the stereotypical traits for a business administration student.

Now, assume prior probabilities:

- \( P(H) \) for "computer science": Let's assume a prior of 0.2, reflecting a moderate probability that Adam could be studying this field.
- \( P(H) \) for "business administration": Let's assume a prior of 0.1, reflecting a lower probability compared to computer science.

We'll assume \( P(E) \) can be adjusted to reflect the overall presence of such personality traits in the general graduate student population. However, this will act as a normalizing factor over all possible hypotheses and won't affect the relative comparison between the hypotheses we're interested in here.

Given these qualitative intuitions, let's estimate the conditional probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Keep in mind that these are rough estimations based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculations. For an accurate numerical analysis, we would need more specific data.
