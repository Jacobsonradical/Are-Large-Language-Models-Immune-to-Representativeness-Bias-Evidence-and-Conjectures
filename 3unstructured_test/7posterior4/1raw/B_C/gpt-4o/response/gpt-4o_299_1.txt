To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for hypotheses \( H \) (field of study being business administration or computer science) given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule. The formal expression of Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of each hypothesis before considering the personality sketch) and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence), we'll make some informed assumptions based on the given information and general knowledge:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - A field generally associated with a more extroverted personality, interest in business, leadership, management skills, and less focus on nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.
   - \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Relatively low, as the personality sketch does not align closely with typical traits needed for this field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - A field that tends to attract individuals who are good at understanding abstract concepts, solving puzzles, and having high intelligence, fitting more closely with Adam's personality traits.
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Relatively high, as Adam's characteristics align well with what is often expected in this field.

Given these considerations and without precise numerical priors, we'll provide qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the fit between Adam's personality sketch and the hypothesized fields. Specific numerical probabilities would require more detailed information about priors and likelihoods.
