To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to combine our prior beliefs about fields of study with the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in each field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down:

1. **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
2. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
3. **P(E)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields, serving as a normalizing constant.

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we will make qualitative estimates based on the details provided:

### Business Administration
- **P(E|H)**: Business administration might not typically emphasize the curiosity about nature, empathy, or love for animals. It's more focused on leadership, finance, and organizational behavior. Thus, we might rate the likelihood comparatively low.
- **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field for graduates, so we will assume a moderate prior.

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H)**: Computer science may align well with Adamâ€™s high intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, as these traits are important for problem-solving and abstract thinking. The love for nature and animals is less directly relevant but not incompatible.
- **P(H)**: Computer Science is also a common field for graduates, so we will assume a moderate prior.

### Estimations
- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Low (perhaps 0.1, as the personality sketch doesn't align strongly with typical characteristics of a business admin student).
  - \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Moderate (let's assume 0.2).

- For **computer science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): High (perhaps 0.5, considering the alignment with problem-solving and intelligence).
  - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Moderate (let's assume 0.2).

Let's assume \( P(E) \) approximately normalizes based on typical distributions. Since we are not given \( P(E) \), it will cancel out comparatively in the numerator, so we focus on the relative values.

### Final Calculation:
- Posterior for **business administration**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

- Posterior for **computer science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \]

Since both probabilities are relative based on their likelihood scores and their priors, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "computer science": 0.1
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the personality sketch provided, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in computer science compared to business administration in 2021.
