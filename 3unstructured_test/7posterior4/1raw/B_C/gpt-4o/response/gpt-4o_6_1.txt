To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without actual data for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \), we are limited to making educated guesses based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam. We need to estimate how likely it is that Adam would be enrolled in computer science or business administration based on his personality traits.

Given the information:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**
2. **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**
5. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**

Let's make the following rough estimates:

- **Computer Science**:
  - Curiosity and problem-solving skills are strong indicators for a field like computer science.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
  - Quiet nature may also fit the stereotypical image of a computer scientist.

- **Business Administration**:
  - Strong empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication are good traits for business administration.
  - However, a quiet nature and love for animals might be less strongly correlated with business administration.

Based on these considerations, we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities. Let's assume:

- **P(E|Computer Science)** is relatively high because of his problem-solving skills and interest in abstract concepts.
- **P(E|Business Administration)** is moderately high due to his understanding of hard work and empathy.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some provisional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective estimates, and the real probabilities would require more detailed data collection and analysis.
