To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. In the absence of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch (E).

However, without additional data, we can provide a qualitative assessment rather than precise numerical probabilities.

The personality sketch suggests Adam has traits such as:
- Genuine curiosity about nature
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, let's qualitatively assess Adam's fit for each field.

### Computer Science:
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work are also good indicators.
- The connection to a strong curiosity about nature may not be as directly relevant but doesn't contradict a fit.

### Business Administration:
- While appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant, strong empathy can be beneficial in business.
- However, compared to computer science, the traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles) are less directly associated with business administration.
- Business administration often involves interpersonal and managerial skills, which are not explicitly highlighted in the sketch.

### Qualitative Assessment:
Given the qualitative nature of this assessment and the alignment of traits with computer science, we might estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

This estimation shows a higher conditional probability for computer science given the traits mentioned, but also recognizes that business administration is not entirely ruled out based on the hard work and empathy aspects.
