To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to identify two main components for each field:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)** - The initial probability of Adam being in that field without considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** - The probability of the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that field.

**Bayes' Rule** is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the same for all fields, we can ignore it for comparison across fields. Thus, we focus on:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, without empirical data, we have to rely on qualitative assessments. Let’s consider these assessments for each field:

### Computer Science (CS)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a common field, so we might assign a reasonable prior, say \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's appreciation for solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits align well with the skills needed in Computer Science. Therefore, we might say \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \).

### Business Administration (BA)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is also a common field, so we might assign a similar prior, say \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business Administration might value empathy and appreciation for hard work, but it’s less directly related to the love of nature, solving puzzles, and abstract concepts. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).

Combining these, we get:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = 0.09
\]

To get the final probabilities, we would normalize these values. But since the prompt specifies that they don't need to add up to 1, we'll present these proportional values directly.

Thus, the qualitative assessment results in the following:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
