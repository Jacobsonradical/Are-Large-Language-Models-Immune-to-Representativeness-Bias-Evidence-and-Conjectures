To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field \(P(H)\), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given each hypothesis \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have the exact prior probabilities or detailed likelihoods, we'll have to reason qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch \(E\):

1. **Computer Science**: Adam has high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, all of which are relevant and beneficial traits for a student in computer science. His curiosity about nature and empathy are less relevant but do not contradict this field.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's traits like empathy, understanding, appreciation for hard work, and dedication can be quite relevant to business administration as well. However, his love for animals, puzzles, and nature might be less commonly associated with this field.

Given the subjective nature of the information, let's make a reasoned qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative matching of Adam's traits to each field. Since the curiosity about nature and abstract concepts aligns more closely with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science, we assigned a higher probability to that field. The business administration field also values empathy and dedication, but other traits are less closely aligned.
