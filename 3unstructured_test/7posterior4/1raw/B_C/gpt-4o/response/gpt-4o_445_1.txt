To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have direct data for these, we will rely on educated estimations based on the personality traits and field characteristics.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and doesn't affect the relative comparison between the fields, so we can compare \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) directly.

Given Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, etc.), it seems he might be more suited for fields like biology or environmental science over business administration. However, for the purpose of this question, let's focus on business administration and computer science:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): This could be estimated based on the proportion of graduate students in business administration in the U.S. However, we'll assume a fairly low prior for Adam given his personality traits don't strongly match typical motivations for business administration.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Low - The personality traits mentioned don't align very well with typical traits needed in business administration.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior probability, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): This could also be estimated from general data on graduate distributions. Still, his high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles increase this prior.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to high - Adam's love for problem-solving, understanding abstract concepts, and high intelligence align well with computer science traits.

Assuming no specific numerical data for priors but considering the personality alignment, we can provide the estimated probabilities. Let's assign conservative probabilities simply as a subjective assessment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the given information about Adam's interests and the typical requirements and nature of the fields described. Actual numerical probabilities would require more detailed statistical data.
