To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each field, as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \). Without specific numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods, I can only provide a qualitative approach. However, I can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Let's assume the following qualitative assessments:
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) of being enrolled in business administration (\( H_1 \)): likely lower due to the personality sketch not aligning strongly with typical traits for this field.
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) of being enrolled in computer science (\( H_2 \)): likely higher due to alignment with traits such as high intelligence, abstract thinking, puzzle-solving, and curiosity about nature.

Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) assessments:
- \( P(E|H_1) \) for business administration: relatively low, as the subject's traits do not align strongly with typical profiles in this field.
- \( P(E|H_2) \) for computer science: relatively high, due to the strong match of traits with common profiles in computer science.

Given these qualitative considerations, here are the approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

The actual values will depend on the specific details of \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), but these estimates reflect the relative likelihood based on the given personality sketch.
