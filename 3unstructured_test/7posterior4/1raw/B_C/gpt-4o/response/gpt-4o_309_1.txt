To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial belief about the probability of Adam being in a specific field before considering the personality sketch \( E \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field \( H \).
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' Rule can be defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will estimate these probabilities based on reasonable assumptions, as we do not have exact numerical data.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.15 \) (business-related graduate programs typically have a moderate enrollment rate).
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.25 \) (due to the popularity and high enrollment in computer science graduate programs).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For business administration: Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals might make it less likely that he is in a business administration program, so we assign a lower likelihood \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \).
   - For computer science: Adam's intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with traits often associated with computer science students, so we assign a higher likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: We assume this is a normalization factor that ensures the total probability sums up correctly. Since we're comparing two fields, we can ignore this in the relative comparison of probabilities.

Based on these assumptions:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

We'll omit the evidence term \( P(E) \) since it is the same in both equations, and we are comparing relative values:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities can be noted as relative likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": "0.015",
  "computer science": "0.15"
}

Please note that these values are approximate and based on the subjected assumptions.
