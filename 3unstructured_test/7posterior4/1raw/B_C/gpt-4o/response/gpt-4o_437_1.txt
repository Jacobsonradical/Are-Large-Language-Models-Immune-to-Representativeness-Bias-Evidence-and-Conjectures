To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of each field and the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch in each of those fields. However, since these priors and likelihoods are not provided, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information and general norms.

First, I will assume that prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of being enrolled in computer science and business administration are generic priors, which might typically be around 0.1 (10%) each for simplicity, given the wide range of graduate fields.

Next, I'll estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) â€” the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he is in computer science or business administration.

### Likelihood Estimations:

- **Computer Science**: 
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking (common in CS): high likelihood.
  - Solving puzzles (aligned with CS problem-solving): high likelihood.
  - Curiosity about nature and animals (less common in CS): lower likelihood.
  - Empathy, warm heart, appreciation for hard work (less specific to CS, but neutral impact): moderate likelihood.

- **Business Administration**: 
  - Empathy, warm heart (good fit for leadership and HR aspects of business): high likelihood.
  - Appreciation for hard work (aligned with business): high likelihood.
  - Curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, deep love for animals (less specific, lower relevance): moderate-to-low likelihood.
  - High intelligence and abstract thinking (valuable but less distinguishing in business): moderate likelihood.

Using these qualitative assessments, let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.4 \)

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing Adam's personality across all fields) is a normalizing constant that we can assume is similar across the fields for relative comparison, it simplifies our calculations:

### Posterior Calculations:
Given the above, we can approximate:

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]

- For **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.04 / P(E) \]

The ratio between these probabilities will give an indicative posterior probability relative to each other, even without knowing \( P(E) \). 

Thus, the approximate conditional posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) could reasonably be presented as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

This reflects a higher likelihood for Adam being in computer science given his personality traits, but a non-trivial likelihood for business administration considering the traits that align with the field.
