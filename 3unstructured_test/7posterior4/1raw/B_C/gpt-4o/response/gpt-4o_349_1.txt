To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to establish the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The normalizing constant, which is the total probability of the evidence \( E \) under all hypotheses.

For simplicity and based on common assumptions about graduate student distributions and personality traits related to each field, we will make some reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science
- **Observation & Reasoning**:
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align with typical traits for computer science students.
  - Curiosity about nature, while relevant, is less directly associated but doesn't rule out the field.

- **Estimates**:
  - Let \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \): Traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles are relatively common.
  - Let \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \): A rough estimate since it's a common graduate field.

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
- **Observation & Reasoning**:
  - Empathy, understanding, and appreciation for hard work could be essential for business administration.
  - Abstract concept understanding is also crucial but high intelligence isn't specifically tailored to this field.

- **Estimates**:
  - Let \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \): Traits are somewhat aligned but less about solving puzzles.
  - Let \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.15 \): A slightly rarer field than computer science among grad students.

### Bringing It Together with Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \)

\( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be a bit challenging to estimate without comprehensive data. However, we can compare the posteriors relatively without knowing \( P(E) \) precisely.

1. **For Computer Science**:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

2. **For Business Administration**:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

If we normalize these to make it more interpretable while recognizing that these are relative comparisons:

Normalized estimates:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.2 = 0.12 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.15 = 0.045 \)

Now convert them into probability range:

\[
\text{Total} = 0.12 + 0.045 \approx 0.165
\]

So we have:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.165} \approx 0.727
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \approx \frac{0.045}{0.165} \approx 0.273
\]

### Final Answers

\[
{
  "computer science": "0.727",
  "business administration": "0.273"
}
\]
