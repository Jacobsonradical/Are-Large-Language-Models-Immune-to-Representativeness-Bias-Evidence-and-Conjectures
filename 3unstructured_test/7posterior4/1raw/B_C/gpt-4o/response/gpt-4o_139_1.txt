To carry out this calculation accurately, we'd need the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each of these fields (P(H)), the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given he's enrolled in each field (P(E|H)), and the overall probability of having that personality sketch (P(E)). 

Since we don't have actual numeric values for these, I will make some educated assumptions based on the description provided.

Let's assume:
1. **Priors**:
   - P(H_computer_science): This represents the general likelihood of a graduate student being in computer science. Let's assume this is relatively high given the general trend.
   - P(H_business_administration): Similarly, let's assume the likelihood of a graduate student being in business administration is fairly high.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood that he is in computer science could be assumed to be moderate to high, since he is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles.
   - The likelihood that he is in business administration might be lower, as this field often requires more focus on quantitative analysis, finance, and management rather than abstract thinking and puzzles. 

3. **Marginal Probability (P(E))**:
   - This is the overall probability of anyone having such a personality sketch, which would normalize our results, but since we don't have exact figures, we'll skip this for simplicity in estimation.

Given these assumptions, here's a rough estimation without exact figures:

P(H|E) ‚àù P(E|H) * P(H),

Based on the personality sketch (E):

P(E|H_computer_science) is high,
P(E|H_business_administration) is moderate to low.

Thus:

{
  "computer science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

These numbers are heuristic and based on qualitative reasoning due to the lack of exact data.
