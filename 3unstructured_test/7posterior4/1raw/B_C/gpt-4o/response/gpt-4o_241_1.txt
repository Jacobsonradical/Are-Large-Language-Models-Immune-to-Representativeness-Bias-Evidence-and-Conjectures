To utilize Bayes' rule for computing the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)), and the overall probability of the evidence (\( P(E) \)). However, without specific numerical priors or likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative reasoning for these probabilities.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, here's a qualitative assessment:

1. **Computer Science**: High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts align with success in computer science. Enjoying solving puzzles also fits well since many aspects of computer science involve problem-solving. While not directly related to nature or animals, computer science can appeal to a logical, intelligent individual.

2. **Business Administration**: While being intelligent and appreciating hard work align with business administration, the subjects of nature, empathy, and love for animals are less directly related. Business administration generally focuses more on interpersonal skills, leadership, finance, and organizational behavior, which are less emphasized in his sketch.

**Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \))**:
- **Computer Science**: Moderate to high likelihood
- **Business Administration**: Low to moderate likelihood

Given this qualitative analysis, let's assign higher probability to Computer Science than to Business Administration. 

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This distribution recognizes the alignment of Adam's characteristics more with computer science than with business administration while considering that other fields could also fit his profile.
