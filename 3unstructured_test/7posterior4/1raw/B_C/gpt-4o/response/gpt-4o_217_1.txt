To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch enrolling in each field, as well as the prior probability of graduate students enrolling in those fields. Since we don't have detailed prior probabilities without additional data, we will focus on the qualitative likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch.

Here's Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have exact numbers, we will base our answers on the qualitative alignment between Adam's traits and the typical traits of students in each field.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as having high intelligence, being good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles, and having a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These characteristics align well with students in computer science, which often requires problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.

2. **Business Administration**: Adam's strong empathy, warm heart, and appreciation for hard work might suggest some suitability for business administration, particularly in roles that involve teamwork, leadership, and dealing with people. However, the focus on nature, plants, and animals might not directly align with typical MBA curricula.

Given this, the qualitative likelihood \( P(E|H) \) would be higher for computer science than for business administration, assuming a relatively higher prior probability of Adam's traits aligning well with computer science.

Thus, our educated guesses for the probabilities might look like this:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Please note these values are hypothetical estimations based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise statistical data.
