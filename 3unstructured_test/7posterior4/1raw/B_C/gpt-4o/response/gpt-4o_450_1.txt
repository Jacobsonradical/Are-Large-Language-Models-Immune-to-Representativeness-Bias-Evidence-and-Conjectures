To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field) and \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of the provided personality sketch given that he is in that field).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles: These traits fit well with a profile for computer science.
   - Appreciation for hard work: This is relevant but less distinctive.
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals: These are not strong indicators for CS.

2. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is highly relevant.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart: These traits are advantageous in business administration but not unique to it.
   - High intelligence: This is relevant but less distinct for BA.
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals: These are less indicative for BA.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate the likelihoods qualitatively.

### Estimations:
1. **P(E|H) for Computer Science (CS):**
   - High alignment with some traits (abstract concepts, puzzles) suggests high \( P(E|CS) \).

2. **P(E|H) for Business Administration (BA):**
   - Moderate alignment with traits like empathy and understanding hard work, but less strong on more distinctive traits (abstract thinking, puzzles).

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):
- Assume the prior probabilities for each field are similar due to a lack of specific data.

### Normalization:
We won't normalize because non-normalized values are requested.

Based on these estimations, here are the qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,  // Higher due to strong alignment with intelligence and puzzle traits.
  "business administration": 0.3  // Moderate due to empathy and hard work but less alignment with others.
}
```

Again, it's important to note that these are qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and general perceptions of these fields.
