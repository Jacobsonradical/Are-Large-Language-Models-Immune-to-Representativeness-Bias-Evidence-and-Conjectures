To compute posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), Bayes' rule is used:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have specific numbers to plug into Bayes' rule, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the provided personality sketch.

Let's break down each component:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field (without knowing anything about his personality).
- \( P(E) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch overall.

Given Adam's characteristics:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Typically, business administration students might not show a strong inclination toward nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving to the same extent as Adam.
- Lower likelihood compared to Computer Science.

**For Computer Science:**
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \): Computer science students often have an interest in solving puzzles and abstract thinking, which aligns well with Adam's traits. While empathy and love for animals are less specific to CS, they don't lower this likelihood significantly.
- Higher likelihood compared to Business Administration.

Without exact numerical priors and likelihoods, we qualitatively estimate:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) &\ll P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, our estimates might look like:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```
The values are not exact but offer a qualitative comparison showing higher posterior probability for Computer Science based on Adam's personality traits.
