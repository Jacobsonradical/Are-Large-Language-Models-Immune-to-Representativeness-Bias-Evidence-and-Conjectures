To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of Adam's traits given the field and the prior probability of each field.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis (field) given the evidence (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we'll need to make some educated estimates based on typical attributes. 

For Adam, the traits that stand out are a genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and interest in solving puzzles. These traits may fit differently into various fields:

### Computer Science

- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): High intelligence and solving puzzles are strong fits. Less clear are his empathy, and love for nature and animals.
- Prior probability \( P(H_{cs}) \): Roughly informed by the popularity of computer science among graduate programs.

### Business Administration

- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Empathy and appreciation for the hard work are more aligned. Less interaction with nature and animals.
- Prior probability \( P(H_{ba}) \): Similarly, the popularity of business administration programs.

Given these considerations, let's provide rough estimates for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values are hypothetical and based on general knowledge about typical interests and skills in these fields. In an actual scenario, more specific data and probabilities would be required for precise computation.
