To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In the absence of specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only make qualitative judgments based on the description provided.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

### Computer Science
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \):
  - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts favor computer science (\( P(E|\text{computer science})\) high).
  - Enjoys solving puzzles also aligns well with computer science.
  - Curiosity about nature and empathy for animals are not particularly indicative but do not contradict either.
  
### Business Administration
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \):
  - High understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit business administration.
  - Empathy and a warm heart can be beneficial in fields like management and leadership.
  - The subject’s curiosity about nature and love for animals, and intelligence might be less directly aligned.

Considering these factors and without precise numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can provide a rough qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

- **Computer Science**: Adam’s intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles strongly suggest a natural fit for computer science.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence could fit business administration, his interests in nature and animals are less directly related.

This is a qualitative judgment based on the given personality sketch and common associations with field requirements.
