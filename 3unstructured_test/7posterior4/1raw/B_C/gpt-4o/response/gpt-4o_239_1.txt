To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given his enrollment in each field, and then normalize these probabilities using the prior probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this problem:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field (business administration or computer science).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \(E\) given his enrollment in a specific field.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \(E\).

Without specific prior probabilities, we will consider relative likelihoods based on Adam's characteristics in the personality sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm-hearted with strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We will make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration often involves people skills, leadership, management, and organizational behavior.
   - The personality traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work might be relevant but are less specific to curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, and love for animals.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science requires problem-solving skills, understanding of abstract concepts, and high intelligence.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals are not necessarily strong indicators, but they do not rule out computer science.

Given these assumptions, we can reasonably estimate the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) for each field:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) & \approx 0.2 \quad (\text{lower due to misalignment with nature and puzzle interests}) \\
P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) & \approx 0.7 \quad (\text{higher due to alignment with solving puzzles and abstract thinking}) \\
\end{aligned}
\]

If we assume the prior probabilities \(P(H_{\text{business administration}})\) and \(P(H_{\text{computer science}})\) are equal (\(0.5\) each, for simplification):

Using Bayes' rule: 

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) & = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \\
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) & = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.35}{P(E)} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Since we're not normalizing by \(P(E)\) and considering relative likelihoods, we simply compare 0.1 and 0.35.

Thus, the normalized probabilities will reflect higher likelihood for computer science given the personality sketch. Here is the result:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{business administration}: & \quad \frac{0.1}{0.45} \approx 0.22 \\
\text{computer science}: & \quad \frac{0.35}{0.45} \approx 0.78 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So the final answer formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.22",
  "computer science": "0.78"
}
```
