To apply Bayes' rule for this, we need some additional baseline probabilities, often called priors. These would tell us the general likelihood of a graduate student being in each field, independent of the personality sketch E. However, since we don't have these exact priors, we'll make educated guesses based on typical distributions of graduate students across fields, along with how well Adam's personality sketch fits with each field.

Given the provided personality sketch of Adam, it seems he's more likely to be in a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, intelligence, abstract reasoning abilities, and strong empathy. Here are tentative posterior probabilities for each field based on these considerations:

**Field: Computer Science**
- **Prior probability (P(H))**: Let's assume the general proportion of graduate students in computer science is around 20%.
- **Likelihood given personality sketch (P(E|H))**: Adam's traits like high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are quite fitting for computer science, though his love for nature isn't a strong match. Let's assign a moderate likelihood, say 0.5.

**Field: Business Administration**
- **Prior probability (P(H))**: Let's assume the general proportion of graduate students in business administration is around 10%.
- **Likelihood given personality sketch (P(E|H))**: The traits described (strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for nature and hard work) aren't typically those associated with business administration students. Let's assign a lower likelihood, say 0.2.

Posterior probabilities can be approximated using Bayes' rule without normalizing since we're only comparing two fields:

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \times P(H) \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.20 = 0.10 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.10 = 0.02 \]

Given these calculations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.10,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
```

Note that these values are not exact, and obtaining more precise posterior probabilities would require access to actual prior probabilities and more specific likelihood estimations.
