To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field (before considering the evidence E), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing E given H), and the evidence \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing E across all hypotheses).

Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of exact prior probabilities and likelihood values, I'll make some reasoned estimations based on common knowledge and the details in Adam's personality sketch (E).

### Business Administration (H = business administration)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Business administration is quite a common graduate field, though usually more oriented towards individuals with a strong inclination towards leadership and corporate environments rather than nature and abstract concepts. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.2.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Considering Adam's profile, it seems unlikely that someone with his inclinations would pursue business administration. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) conservatively at 0.05.

### Computer Science (H = computer science)
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Computer science is also a common graduate field. It's a good fit for individuals with high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) as 0.3.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, computer science appears to be a fitting field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) at 0.6.

### Calculations:
We need to calculate the evidence \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \cdots \]
Where \( H_1, H_2, \ldots \) are different hypotheses.

For our fields:
\[ P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.2 + 0.6 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.19 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
#### Business Administration
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.0526 \]

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) \approx 0.9474 \]

Using these calculations, we can express the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0526,
  "computer science": 0.9474
}
```

These estimations suggest that with the given personality sketch, Adam is significantly more likely to have been enrolled in a computer science graduate program than in business administration.
