To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in "computer science" or "business administration" using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given the field, and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume the priors \( P(H) \) to be uniform, i.e., equal for both fields, and we will focus on determining the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We need to evaluate how likely these traits are for computer science students compared to business administration students.

### Likelihood Evaluation:
**Computer Science (\( P(E|computer\ science) \)):**
- Curiosity about nature might be less common.
- Enjoying puzzles suggests a strong fit.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are key traits.
- Less emphasis on empathy and love for animals, but not incompatible.
- Appreciation for hard work fits well.

**Business Administration (\( P(E|business\ administration) \)):**
- Curiosity about nature might be less relevant.
- Enjoying puzzles is less typical but possible.
- Empathy and warm heart are beneficial in business.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit but maybe less emphasized.
- Appreciation for hard work is highly relevant.

From the above evaluation, we might infer:
- Adam's traits are very much aligned with computer science due to the emphasis on puzzles, abstract concepts, and intelligence.
- Adam's traits such as empathy and love for animals might be more slightly relevant in business administration roles focused on people management but may not be primary characteristics.

### Relative Likelihoods:
Considering the fitting of traits:
- Let’s assume \( P(E|computer\ science) = 0.7 \)
- Let’s assume \( P(E|business\ administration) = 0.3 \)

### Final Calculation:
Assuming equal priors \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since we are not given specific data to differentiate):
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \[ P(E) = P(E|computer\ science) \cdot P(computer\ science) + P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ P(computer\ science|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```
