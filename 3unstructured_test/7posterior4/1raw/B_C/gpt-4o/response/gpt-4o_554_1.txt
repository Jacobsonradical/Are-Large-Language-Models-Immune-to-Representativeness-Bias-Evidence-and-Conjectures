To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of study and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is indeed enrolled in that field. Since we do not have specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can make reasoned qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and the nature of the fields.

Let's break down some qualitative aspects first:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles.
   - Requires technical and analytical skills which Adam seems to possess.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Might not explicitly require interest in nature, animals or solving puzzles.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant but less specific compared to the traits for computer science.

Now, using Bayes' rule in a qualitative manner:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is how likely we are to observe Adam's characteristics given that he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is how probable it is for any random student to be in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics irrespective of the field (which will be the same across both computations and cancels out in relative ranking).

Given the personality details provided and matching it with the field characteristics, we can make a reasoned qualitative guess as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
