To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numbers for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E) \), we’ll use the information provided in Adam's personality sketch to make a reasoned estimate.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant for computer science.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles, which correlates well with problem-solving skills often required in computer science.
   - Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. While empathy and understanding are helpful in business administration especially in roles related to human resources or corporate social responsibility, they are not the core competencies typically highlighted.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication are valuable traits but not exclusive to business administration.
   - Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is not as high as for computer science but not negligible.

Given these qualitative assessments and the nature of the personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values reflect that Adam’s attributes somewhat align more with a computer science field due to his interest in puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, but still maintain significant relevance to business administration.
