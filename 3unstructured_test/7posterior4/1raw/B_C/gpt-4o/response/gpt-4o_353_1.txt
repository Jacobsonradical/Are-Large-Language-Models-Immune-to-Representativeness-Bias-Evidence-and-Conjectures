To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following general formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, to determine \( P(E) \), we would need the entire probability distribution over all possible fields, which is not provided here. Therefore, let's focus on understanding relative likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{BA} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We'll need to make some reasonable assumptions regarding \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) based on how well the personality traits match typical profiles for these fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts lean towards computer science.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns well with algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in computer science.
   - Empathy and love for animals might not directly correlate with computer science as much.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant but is broadly applicable.
   - Empathy can be important in leadership and management roles.
   - Strong warm-hearted nature may be beneficial in human resources or employee management aspects, but nature curiosity and love for animals might not be typically associated.

Given these assumptions:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be higher due to Adam's problem-solving abilities and intelligence.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be lower due to less alignment with core personality traits needed for business administration.

I'll use qualitative reasoning for relative probabilities.
