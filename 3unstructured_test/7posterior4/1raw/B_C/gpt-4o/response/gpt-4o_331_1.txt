To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the information available and without exact numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, the best we can do is to make qualitative inferences based on the attributes provided in the personality sketch (E).

1. **Business Administration**
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for business administration: Graduate programs in business administration are common but typically associated with attributes like leadership, management skills, and quantitative skills.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's attributes like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for quiet, abstract thinking do not strongly align with the typical traits expected in business administration.
   
2. **Computer Science**
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for computer science: Computer Science is also a popular field, especially for individuals who enjoy solving puzzles, abstract thinking, and having a strong appreciation for hard work.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work align well with the typical characteristics of a computer science student.

Given these considerations, we can make an educated estimation about the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch aligns much better with computer science than with business administration. Note these are rough estimates based on qualitative assessment rather than precise calculations.
