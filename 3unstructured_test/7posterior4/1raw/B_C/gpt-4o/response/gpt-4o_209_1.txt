To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to apply:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Instead, we will make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of each field.

Here's how we might approach this without exact numbers:

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given he is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field, which might depend on the popularity of the field among graduate students.

Given the information:

- **E**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy and love for animals, is highly intelligent, and appreciates hard work and dedication.
- **Business Administration (H1)**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \): Business administration students might have diverse interests, but the provided traits (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, love for animals) are not particularly aligned with the typical focus of this field.
- **Computer Science (H2)**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \): Computer science students often possess high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles and abstract concepts, making this field more aligned with Adam's traits.

### Hypothetical Assessment (Qualitative):

Let's assume some prior probabilities and likelihoods based on general trends, noting that these are rough estimates.

- **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \):
  - \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \): 0.3 (assuming moderate popularity)
  - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \): 0.3 (assuming moderate popularity, equal to business administration for simplicity)

- **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \) (qualitative):
  - \( P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.7 \)

- **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \):
  Proportional to the sum of the products of priors and respective likelihoods:
  \[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.7) = 0.3 \]

### Calculations:

1. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.1
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = 0.7
   \]

Thus, reflecting these assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are based on qualitative reasoning and an estimation approach. In a real-world scenario, one would need more precise data to perform an accurate Bayesian update.
