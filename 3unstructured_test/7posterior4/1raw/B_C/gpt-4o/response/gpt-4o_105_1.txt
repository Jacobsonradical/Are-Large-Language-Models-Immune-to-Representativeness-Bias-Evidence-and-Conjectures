To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand and break down the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence to be true under all hypotheses.

Since we don't have precise numerical values for these probabilities, I will make reasoned estimates based on the information given in the sketch of Adam's personality and typical characteristics associated with the respective fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Personality traits such as strong empathy, warm heart, love for animals, and high intelligence are not typically the primary markers for Business Administration, which usually emphasizes leadership, strategic thinking, and decision-making skills. 
   - Given the description, \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) is likely lower.
   - The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) for any student could be moderate as Business Administration is a common field.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and a quiet demeanor align well with the typical aptitudes for Computer Science students.
   - Given the description, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer\_science}}) \) is likely higher.
   - The prior probability \( P(H_{\text{computer\_science}}) \) for any student is also moderate or high since Computer Science is a common and popular field.

Given these considerations, here's an approximation as actual numerical values need more specific data which we don't have.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```
This approximation is built on the fact that Adam's described personality aligns more closely with the typical profile of a Computer Science student rather than a Business Administration student.
