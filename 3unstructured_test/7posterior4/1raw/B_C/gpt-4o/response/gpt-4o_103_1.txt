To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the specific details of Adam's personality sketch (E) and how they align with the typical characteristics of students in each field (H). However, we don't have specific prior probabilities (P(H)) or likelihoods (P(E|H)) for each field. Given this limitation, we'll make plausible qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and their alignment with the respective fields. 

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're interested in the relative probabilities, we'll focus on comparing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically involves leadership, management skills, and a strong interest in business operations and strategy.
   - Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work may not align strongly with this field.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Often attracts individuals with strong analytical skills, a love for problem-solving, and high intelligence.
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which makes this field a more plausible match based on the given traits.

Given the qualitative assessment, we can estimate the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical characteristics of students in these fields, without precise numerical data.
