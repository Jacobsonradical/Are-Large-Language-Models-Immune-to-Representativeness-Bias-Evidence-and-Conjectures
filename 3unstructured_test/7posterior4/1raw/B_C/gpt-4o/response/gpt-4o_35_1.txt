To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis and the prior probability of each hypothesis. However, because the prior probabilities and exact likelihoods are not provided, we will consider qualitative understanding based on the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the given hypotheses:

- **Business administration**
- **Computer science**

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll intuitively consider \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).

### Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \)
We need to determine the likelihood of someone with Adam's characteristics being in each field:

- **Business administration**:
  - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Less relevant
  - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Doesn't strongly correlate
  - **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: Less relevant 
  - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Relevant, but not definitive
  - **Appreciation for hard work**: Relevant

- **Computer science**:
  - **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Neutral
  - **Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles**: Strongly correlates
  - **Warm heart, empathy, love for animals**: Less relevant but doesn't exclude
  - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Highly relevant
  - **Appreciation for hard work**: Relevant

### Priors: \( P(H) \)
The prior probability of students enrolling in each major varies by school and region, but generally:

- **Business administration**: Moderate prior likelihood
- **Computer science**: Moderate to high prior likelihood due to the high demand in the current era

### Normalizing Factor: \( P(E) \)
The overall evidence probability \( P(E) \) is the same for both, so it will cancel out when comparing the two computed \( P(H|E) \).

Given the qualitative assessment:

- **Computer science**: 
  - Stronger correlation with puzzle-solving, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
  - Moderate number of individuals with these traits.
  
- **Business administration**: 
  - Less direct correlation; a broader demographic might fit into business administration.

### Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are assigned based on qualitative reasoning given the personality traits provided and common stereotypes regarding these fields. Actual probabilities would require more detailed data and context about Adam and corresponding fields of study.
