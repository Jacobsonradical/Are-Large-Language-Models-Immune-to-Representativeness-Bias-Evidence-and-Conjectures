To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would generally need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, as well as the likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). However, since we don't have specific numerical priors or likelihoods provided, we need to make some qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality traits.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don’t have exact values, we will qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given his field of study) and \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of him enrolling in each field). Here's an analysis based on Adam's personality:

1. **Computer Science:**
    - Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are beneficial traits for computer science.
    - His interest in abstract concepts can also be a good fit for theoretical aspects of computer science.
    - However, his deep love for animals and nature might not be directly related to computer science, though it’s still possible he has these interests outside his field.

    Given these qualitative assessments, the probability \( P(E|H = \text{computer science}) \) might be higher based on the mentioned traits (intelligence, solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts).

2. **Business Administration:**
    - The traits of strong empathy, understanding hard work and dedication can be crucial in business administration.
    - However, his quiet nature and strong interest in nature and animals seem less directly relevant to a typical business administration program.
    - His skills in solving puzzles and abstract thinking might be applicable but are more aligned with fields such as computer science or natural sciences.

    Consequently, the probability \( P(E|H = \text{business administration}) \) might be lower in comparison.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

These numbers are mere qualitative estimates considering the given personality traits and typical alignments with the fields. To get a more accurate posterior probability, we would need detailed prior probabilities and specific likelihood values.
