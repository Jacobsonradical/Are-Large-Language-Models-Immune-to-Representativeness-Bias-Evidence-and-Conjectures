To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have explicit numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field without knowing his personality sketch) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field), nor do we have the marginal probability \( P(E) \) (the probability of Adam having that personality sketch regardless of the field).

Instead, we can make qualitative estimations based on the provided information to determine how well the personality sketch fits the typical characteristics of students in those fields.

For computer science:
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns with problem-solving skills needed in computer science.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and strong empathy are less typical but not incompatible.

For business administration:
- A strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication fit well with business administration.
- Empathy can be beneficial in leadership and team management within business.
- Love for nature and animals is less relevant, and enjoyment of solving puzzles is not specifically characteristic.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize that Adam's personality traits may slightly better align with computer science than business administration. However, the difference isn't vast.

With the above considerations, we can estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.35
}
```

Again, please note that these values are qualitative estimates based on the provided information and typical associations. Without actual data for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, precise numerical calculation is not possible.
