To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) given the personality sketch of Adam \( E \), we need more information about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, in the absence of specific data, we will use qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality traits to construct a reasonable estimate.

### Personality Traits and Corresponding Fields:
1. **Computer Science:**
   - Good at understanding abstract concepts (positive indicator).
   - Enjoys solving puzzles (positive indicator).
   - Strong intelligence (positive indicator).
   - Quiet and has a warm heart (neutral effect).

   The personality sketch aligns quite well with traits desirable in computer science, making a moderate to high likelihood.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy and warm heart (positive indicator, given the emphasis on interpersonal skills).
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication (positive indicator).
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles (neutral to slightly negative, since business often involves extroverted activities like presentations and networking).

   The personality sketch aligns less strongly with traits typical in business administration.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the absence of specific priors and likelihoods, we can make a reasonable estimate based on qualitative alignment with each field.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for computer science based on the personality traits provided in the sketch. If more specific data were available, these estimates could be refined further.
