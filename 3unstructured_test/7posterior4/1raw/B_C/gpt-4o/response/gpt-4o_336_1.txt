To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess how likely Adam's personality traits (as described in the sketch) match with the characteristics typically associated with students in the respective fields of business administration and computer science.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Without specific numerical values or detailed prior information about the prevalence of students in each field, we'll base our estimations on typical personality-trait alignments with each field.

### Business Administration
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: This trait is not particularly aligned with business administration.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This trait might have some alignment, especially with problem-solving aspects of business.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**: While empathy is valuable for business, a love for animals is less directly relevant.
4. **High intelligence and abstract concepts understanding**: This is beneficial but not exclusive to business administration.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: These traits are quite aligned with business.

### Computer Science
1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not directly related but a love for nature can translate to interest in biological algorithms or eco-friendly computing.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Highly aligned with the analytical problem-solving nature of computer science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals**: While empathy is not the main focus in computer science, developers do consider user impact.
4. **High intelligence and abstract concepts understanding**: Strongly aligned with the field, which requires heavy abstraction and logical thinking.
5. **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Equally relevant to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior probabilities somewhat as follows. Note that these are educated guesses based on the traits and typical demands of each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These numbers suggest that Adam is more likely to be a graduate student in computer science than in business administration based on the provided personality sketch. However, without specific empirical data, these should be taken as rough estimations.
