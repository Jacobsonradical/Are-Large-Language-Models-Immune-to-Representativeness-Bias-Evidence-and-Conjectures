Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities for each hypothesis. However, we lack the base rate probabilities (prior probabilities) for Adam choosing each field and the likelihood of the personality traits given each field. Instead, we'll provide a qualitative estimate based on the information provided.

The relevant traits from the personality sketch of Adam include:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

Let's evaluate how these traits align with the fields of computer science and business administration:

### Computer Science:
- Curiosity about nature: somewhat relevant if tied to computational biology or environmental modeling.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: highly relevant, as computer science involves solving complex problems.
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: not directly relevant, but empathy can help in team collaborations and user-centered design.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: very relevant for algorithms and theoretical computer science.
- Appreciation for hard work: relevant, as computer science can be demanding and requires persistence.

Estimate: Moderately likely.

### Business Administration:
- Curiosity about nature: less relevant.
- Enjoys solving puzzles: somewhat relevant for strategic planning and problem-solving.
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: relevant in fields like corporate social responsibility, HR, organizational behavior, and possibly sustainable business practices.
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts: relevant for strategic management and complex decision-making.
- Appreciation for hard work: relevant, as the field often requires dedication and commitment.

Estimate: Less likely compared to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, here's the estimated posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

These values are based on inferred alignments between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics required for success in the respective fields, without the actual base rates or detailed likelihoods.
