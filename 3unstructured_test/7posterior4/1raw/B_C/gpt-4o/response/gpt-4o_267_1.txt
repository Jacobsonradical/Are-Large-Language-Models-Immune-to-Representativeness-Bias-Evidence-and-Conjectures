To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we lack the specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in a specific field without any information about his personality) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of having the observed personality given enrollment in a specific field), direct computation is not possible.

Nevertheless, we can make some educated assumptions based on the personality sketch provided and the typical characteristics associated with students in these fields. Here's a qualitative assessment:

- **Business Administration**: Typically attracts individuals who are socially active, interested in human behavior and management, and might have a less pronounced inclination towards abstract concepts and puzzles. While Adam's empathy and warm heart could fit this field, his strong interest in nature, puzzles, and abstract thinking makes this slightly less probable.

- **Computer Science**: Often attracts individuals who enjoy problem-solving, abstract thinking, and puzzles. His curiosity about nature and plants could align with the field's growing interest in bioinformatics and environmental modeling. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also highly compatible with the rigorous demands of this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, we might assign higher posterior probabilities to computer science than to business administration.

Here are the probability estimates based on this qualitative assessment:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.7
}

These values are estimates reflecting the alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics of students in these fields. Without precise prior probabilities and likelihoods, exact numeric computation isnâ€™t feasible.
