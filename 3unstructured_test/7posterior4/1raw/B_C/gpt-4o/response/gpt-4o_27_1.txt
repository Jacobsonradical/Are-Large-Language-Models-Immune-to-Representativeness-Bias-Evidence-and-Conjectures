Sure, let's compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrollment in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Given the limited information, we will make some reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \).

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume the prior probabilities for being enrolled in each field (computer science and business administration) are equally distributed in the general population of graduate students. These priors can be adjusted with more specific data, but for simplicity:
     - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)
     - \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - **Computer Science**: Considering Adam's curiosity about nature, intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving skills, we assign a moderately high likelihood:
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.7 \)
   - **Business Administration**: Given Adam's empathy, warmth, appreciation for hard work, and understanding abstract concepts (important in strategy and finance), but possibly less alignment with curiosity about nature and animals, we assign a somewhat lower likelihood:
     - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.4 \)

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**
   - This is a normalization factor that is constant across all hypotheses for given evidence \( E \). Because we are focusing on computing relative probabilities, we don't need to calculate it explicitly for this comparison; it will cancel out.

Given the assumptions, we can now use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probabilities.

### Posterior Probabilities:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \), as it is a common factor:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.35 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \]

Normalizing these to sum to 1 gives:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.2} = \frac{0.35}{0.55} \approx 0.636 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35 + 0.2} = \frac{0.2}{0.55} \approx 0.364 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

{
  "computer science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.364
}
