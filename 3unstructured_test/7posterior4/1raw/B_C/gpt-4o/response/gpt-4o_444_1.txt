Given E, the personality sketch of Adam, we want to calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for H being "computer science" or "business administration" using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of this personality sketch given he is enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, i.e., the probability of this personality sketch across all possible fields.

To simplify, let's compare the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for both hypotheses "computer science" and "business administration," assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for both fields. This allows us to focus on \( P(E|H) \) rather than getting exact numerical values, as we only need relative probabilities for comparison purposes here.

1. **Computer Science**: Considering Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, enjoying puzzles, strong curiosity about nature, and a quiet demeanor, it seems they align well with the personality traits often associated with students in computer science. Additionally, his love for solving puzzles indicates strong analytical skills, which are crucial in computer science.

   Likelihood \( P(E|H_{computer\;science}) \): High

2. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's warm heart, empathy, and understanding and appreciation for hard work, some traits align with business administration goals of leadership and understanding human dynamics. However, his quiet nature and love for animals, alongside a proclivity for puzzles and abstract thinking, are less directly linked to the usual characteristics associated with business administration compared to computer science.

   Likelihood \( P(E|H_{business\;administration}) \): Moderate to Low

Given the information above, we assign higher likelihood to computer science than to business administration for Adam based on his personality traits.

{
  "computer science": 0.7,  // High likelihood due to alignment of traits such as intelligence, puzzle-solving, and abstract thinking.
  "business administration": 0.3  // Moderate likelihood due to appreciation of hard work and empathy but less alignment with other traits.
}

The values are subjective estimates based on the given personality sketch and assumed to show the relative comparison rather than independent exact calculations.
