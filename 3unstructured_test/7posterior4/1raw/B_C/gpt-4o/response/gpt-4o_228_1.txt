To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would ideally need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) of observing the evidence. However, since we don't have actual numerical values for these, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Given the information:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Considering these points:

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
- Enjoying puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and animals is less directly related to computer science.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
- Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication align with skills needed in business administration.
- Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related.

Using these qualitative assessments to form our estimates:

#### Adjusted Probability for Computer Science
Given Adam's interest in puzzles, intelligence, and abstract thinking, we could assign a moderately high likelihood here.

#### Adjusted Probability for Business Administration
Given Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work, but fewer direct indications from the sketch towards business, we assign a moderate likelihood here.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.65,  // Reflecting alignment with puzzle solving and abstract thinking.
  "business administration": 0.35  // Reflecting alignment with empathy and dedication.
}
```

Please note that these values are not exact probabilities but are reasonable estimates based on the provided personality traits and their relevance to the fields.
