To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for "business administration" and "computer science" given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given no specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll make educated guesses based on Adam's personality and common stereotypes about graduate fields.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Business administration generally values skills such as leadership, strategic thinking, and understanding economic models. Adam's profile doesn't strongly align with this field because his personality highlights curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and puzzle-solving, which are not typical primary traits for business administration students.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Let's assume a moderate prior since business administration is a common graduate field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Computer science fits better with Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are highly valued in computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a highly popular graduate field, so we'll assume it's quite likely.

Given the qualitative nature of these assessments and the goal to provide approximate probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}

These values reflect the higher alignment of Adam's personality traits with computer science as opposed to business administration, based on common expectations about these fields.
