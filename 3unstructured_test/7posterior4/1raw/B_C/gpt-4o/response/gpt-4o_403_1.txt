To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \). 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of having the personality sketch \( E \) given being in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

However, since we don't have explicit numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll approach this qualitatively. We'll consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with each field based on the given information.

**For Computer Science**:
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles matches well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
- Quiet and enjoys solitary activities, often a trait observed in fields requiring intensive independent work.

**For Business Administration**:
- Strong empathy and warm heart could be relevant, but not as defining for an MBA program.
- Deep love for animals and genuine curiosity about nature are less directly related to business studies.
- Abstract thinking is useful, but it might be more crucial in practical and interpersonal skills in business administration contexts.

Given these qualitative evaluations, we might infer that the likelihood of Adam's personality profile fitting computer science is higher than it fitting business administration.

Therefore, the posterior probabilities might look something like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are heuristic and qualitative estimates based on the alignment of personality traits with the expected characteristics of students in each field of graduate study. The actual numerical probabilities would require more data on prior distributions and specific likelihoods.
