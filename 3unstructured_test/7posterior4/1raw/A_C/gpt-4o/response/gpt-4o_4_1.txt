To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute exact values for \(P(H|E)\), we need specific probabilities for \(P(E|H)\) (the probability of Adam having the described personality given he is in a specific field), \(P(H)\) (the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field), and \(P(E)\) (the overall probability of Adam having such a personality). Since exact probabilities are not provided in the prompt, we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the evaluation of Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with each field.

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihood of Adam being in each field based on his personality traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants (positive correlation)
   - Warm heart and empathy, love for animals (highly positive correlation)
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication (positive correlation)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoy solving puzzles (positive correlation)
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts (positive correlation)
   - Quiet nature (neutral to positive correlation, depending on specific area within computer science)

Given these qualitative factors, it appears more likely that Adam's traits align more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, primarily because of his love for animals, empathy, and interest in nature.

Thus, the posterior probabilities might be estimated as follows (keeping in mind these are subjective assessments):

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{{"agricultural and veterinary science"}}: 0.8 \\
\text{{"computer science"}}: 0.5 
\end{array}
\]

These values are not exact but are intended to reflect the stronger alignment of Adamâ€™s personality traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Computer Science. Here is the result in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Note: Since precise numerical values for prior and likelihood probabilities were not given, these estimates are based on qualitative reasoning rather than exact Bayesian computation.
