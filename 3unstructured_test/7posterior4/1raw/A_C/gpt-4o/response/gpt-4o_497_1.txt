Let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities for each hypothesis H given the evidence E.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values, we need to rely on qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities.

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of each hypothesis.
3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the evidence, which acts as a normalizing factor.

Let's make some qualitative assumptions:

1. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: Adam's traits like high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. However, his genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals are not typical traits for a computer science graduate. Thus, while it's not impossible, it's less likely than for the other field.

2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align very well with this field. Traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication also match this field.

3. **P(H) for Computer Science**: The prior probability is high for computer science since it's a highly popular field, but we need to balance this with Adam's specific traits.

4. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The prior probability is less than computer science just based on popularity, but Adam's traits strongly support this field.

Let's arbitrarily assign some qualitative probabilities reflecting these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This shows that given the personality sketch provided, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science, although the exact numerical computation might vary based on actual statistical data specific to student enrollment and field characteristics.
