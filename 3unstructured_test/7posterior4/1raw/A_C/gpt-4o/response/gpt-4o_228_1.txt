To compute the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrollment in that field among graduate students.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

While it is impossible to get exact values without specific data, I can provide a qualitative assessment to infer plausible probabilities based on the given information:

1. ***Computer Science:***
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science: Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make it less aligned.
   - \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: Likely high, as computer science is a common field of study in the U.S. for graduate students in 2021.
   - \( P(E) \): Likely similar across various fields.

2. ***Agricultural and Veterinary Science:***
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Likely lower than Computer Science, as it is a more specialized field.
   - \( P(E) \): Similar across various fields.

Given these qualitative assessments, here's a possible estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are hypothetical approximations to indicate that while there is some chance Adam could be in computer science based on his abstract thinking and intelligence, his personality sketch fits more naturally with agricultural and veterinary science.
