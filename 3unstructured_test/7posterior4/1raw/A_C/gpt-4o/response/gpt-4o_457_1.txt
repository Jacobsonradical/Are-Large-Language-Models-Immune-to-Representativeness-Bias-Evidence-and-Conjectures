To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need three things:

1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which determines how likely the evidence \( E \) is given \( H \).
3. Evidence probability \( P(E) \), which is the total likelihood of observing \( E \) across all hypotheses.

Given that the exact posterior probability calculations require specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, which we don't have here, Iâ€™ll offer rough estimates based on the personality sketch provided:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Adam has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.
- In 2021, Adam was a graduate student in the U.S.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): Very high, given Adam's traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
- Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \): Assume moderate (graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are relatively common).

### Hypothesis 2: Computer Science
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): Moderate-to-low. While Adam's high intelligence and abstract thinking fit, the nature and empathy part is less aligned.
- Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \): Assume high, since computer science is a popular field.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some plausible values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values suggest that based on the given personality sketch, it's more probable that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science rather than Computer Science.
