In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need several pieces of information, including the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since we don't have specific numerical values for these, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the provided sketch to qualitatively estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule can be formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information about Adam, we can make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \): Graduate programs in computer science are quite common.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students are often good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, but traits like a love for nature, plants, and animals are less typical for this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This field may have fewer students in total compared to computer science, so the prior probability might be lower.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): This field highly values a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. It's very aligned with Adam's profile.

Now, let's combine these qualitative assessments to estimate the posterior probabilities:

- For **computer science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be moderate because of the abstract concepts and puzzle-solving trait.
  - \( P(H_{CS}) \) might be relatively high due to the popularity of the field.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) might be high because Adam's interests and traits are strongly aligned with this field.
  - \( P(H_{AVS}) \) might be lower due to fewer total students.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These are rough estimates based on the qualitative fit between Adam's profile and each field.
