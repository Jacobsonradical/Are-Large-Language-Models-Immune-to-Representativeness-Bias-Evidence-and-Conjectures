To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several factors. Unfortunately, without specific prior probabilities or detailed statistical data, we can't calculate exact numeric values. However, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants (strong interest in biology and agriculture).
- Adam has a deep love for animals (aligns with veterinary science).
- Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts (strong fit for computer science).
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a warm heart and strong empathy.

Here's an educated estimate for the posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature and animals, balanced by a strong potential fit for computer science given his high intelligence and problem-solving skills. 

Please note that these are estimated probabilities and could vary with more specific information about Adam's background and interests.
