To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, or the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, or the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, or the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can reasonably estimate the probabilities for computer science and agricultural and veterinary science. However, we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods given directly. Therefore, we will make reasoned assumptions to derive a rough estimate of the posteriors.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as having a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. While these traits align well with computer science, there is no specific mention of an interest in technology or computing.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \): The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is in computer science.
    - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.25 \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in computer science (assuming some level of popularity among graduate fields).
    - \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant which includes the probabilities for all possible hypotheses but doesnâ€™t need to be exact for comparison purposes.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. These traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.8 \): The probability that Adam has the described traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.05 \): The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science (assuming it is less common than computer science).
    - Again, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalizing constant.

Using these estimates, we apply Bayes' rule:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

We can see from this that the raw numbers (before normalization) favor agricultural and veterinary science more strongly because \( 0.04 \) is significant despite its lower prior due to much higher \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \).

However, without the exact normalizing constant, we are looking at relative likelihoods. Hence, our final estimates, normalized informally, would roughly be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This suggests that given Adam's interests and traits, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
