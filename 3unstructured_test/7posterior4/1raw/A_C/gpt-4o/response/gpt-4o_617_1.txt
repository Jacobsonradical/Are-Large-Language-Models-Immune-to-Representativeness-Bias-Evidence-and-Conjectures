To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to rely on not only the prior probabilities of each hypothesis but also the likelihood of E given H. However, in the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
    - Prior Probability \(P(H_{AVS})\): Assume the prior is relatively low given the number of possible graduate fields.
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): High, as Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.
  
2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
    - Prior Probability \(P(H_{CS})\): Likely higher than AVS due to the popularity and broad applicability of the field.
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Moderate, as Adam's quiet nature, puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit a computer science profile, but the direct association with nature and animals is weaker.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can provide an estimate of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values reflect our qualitative assessment that Adam's profile more strongly corresponds to agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature and animals, while still being compatible with computer science but to a lesser degree.
