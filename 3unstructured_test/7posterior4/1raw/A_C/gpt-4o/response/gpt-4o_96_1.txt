To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood or the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, we need to estimate them based on the provided personality sketch.

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - The proportion of graduate students in computer science relative to the total graduate student population.
   - The proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science relative to the total graduate student population.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - The probability of having the described personality traits if Adam is a computer science student.
   - The probability of having the described personality traits if Adam is an agricultural and veterinary science student.

### Estimation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Let's assume computer science is a popular field, and its prior probability could be estimated around \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - Let's assume agricultural and veterinary science is less common, so its prior probability could be \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihoods based on personality sketch**:
   - For computer science:
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
     - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Medium
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
     - Appreciation for hard work: Medium
     - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \)

   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: High
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: Low
     - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: High
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Medium
     - Appreciation for hard work: High
     - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the overall probability of observing the given personality traits in any graduate student.
   - We can consider this as a normalizing constant. Given that we don't have exact values, this would act here to balance the equations.

Using these estimates:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

When considering \( P(E) \), the numerical values would act as a normalizing factor. Given we are comparing:

\[
\frac{0.06}{P(E)} \text{ vs } \frac{0.035}{P(E)}
\]

These are not fully normalized probabilities. However, proportionately:

{
  "computer science": "0.06 / (0.06 + 0.035) \approx 0.63",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.035 / (0.06 + 0.035) \approx 0.37"
}

Thus, the estimates would be:

{
  "computer science": "0.63",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.37"
}
