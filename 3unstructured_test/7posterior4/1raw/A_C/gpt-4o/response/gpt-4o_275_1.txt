To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to utilize the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of seeing evidence \( E \) if hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don’t have numerical values for each component directly, we make qualitative assessments based on Adam’s personality traits and the typical students in each field of study. We'll make reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \)**: 
   Assume graduate enrollment rates can be used as rough priors. Let's use some approximate U.S. graduate statistics:
   - Roughly 3-4% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - Roughly 20% are in computer science.
   
   This gives us:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H_{agv}) = 0.035 \)

2. **Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   We derive how likely Adam's traits are to be found in each field:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding hard work are highly relevant: let's approximate \( P(E|H_{agv}) \approx 0.8 \).
   - For computer science, although high intelligence and problem-solving fit well, the nature and animal interests and empathy are less related: let's approximate \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Marginal probability, \( P(E) \)**:
   \( P(E) \) encompasses the overall likelihood of Adam's personality traits across all fields. Since it's common to both calculations, it's essentially a normalizing factor we don't need to compute explicitly for relative comparisons.

### Calculation:
To compare \( P(H | E) \) for these fields, we compute:

\[
P(H_{cs} | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{agv} | E) \approx \frac{P(E | H_{agv}) \cdot P(H_{agv})}{P(E)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

- For computer science:
\[
P(H_{cs} | E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
\]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{agv} | E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.035}{P(E)} = \frac{0.028}{P(E)}
\]

### Normalizing:

Given these relative measures, when we normalize so both probabilities sum to 1 (for comparison purposes, even though we don't need it exactly for the task), we calculate:

\[
P_{cs} = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.028} \approx 0.682 \quad (Normalized)
\]
\[
P_{agv} = \frac{0.028}{0.06 + 0.028} \approx 0.318 \quad (Normalized)
\]

Therefore, our estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.68,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
```
These values provide a relative sense of likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch.
