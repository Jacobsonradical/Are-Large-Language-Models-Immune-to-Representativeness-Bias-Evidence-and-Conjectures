To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of being enrolled in each field without personality sketch information) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in each specific field). Without specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we'll make reasonable assumptions to qualitatively estimate the probabilities.

Here are the steps using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of each hypothesis \( H \).

### Assumptions:

1. ***Priors \( P(H) \):***
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: Assume a relatively low prior (e.g., \( 0.05 \)) because it's a less common graduate field.
   - Computer science: Assume a moderate prior (e.g., \( 0.15 \)) since it's a popular field.
  
2. ***Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):***
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: High likelihood, because Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit well. Assume \( 0.7 \).
   - For computer science: Moderate likelihood, as his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills fit well, but his other traits are not as closely aligned. Assume \( 0.3 \).

3. ***Overall probability \( P(E) \):***
   This is a normalizing constant and not strictly needed for comparison as long as we're consistent in our estimations for different fields.

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   \[ P(H|E)_{Agri}-{Vet} = \frac{P(E|H)_{Agri}-{Vet} \cdot P(H)_{Agri}-{Vet}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer science:**
   \[ P(H|E)_{Comp-Sci} = \frac{P(E|H)_{Comp-Sci} \cdot P(H)_{Comp-Sci}}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can denote it as \( C \) and calculate relative values:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( \frac{0.035}{C} \)
- Computer science: \( \frac{0.045}{C} \)

### Relative Probabilities:
For these to be useful without normalization, we can directly compare the numerical results:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science: \( 0.035 \)
2. Computer science: \( 0.045 \)

Given these estimates, the relative probabilities suggest that it is slightly more probable that Adam is enrolled in computer science based on our assumed values.
