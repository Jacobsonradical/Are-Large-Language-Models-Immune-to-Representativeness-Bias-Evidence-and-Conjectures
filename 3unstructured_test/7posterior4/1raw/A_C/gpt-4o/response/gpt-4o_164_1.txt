To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field \( P(H) \) and the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we need to rely on qualitative assessment. We'll make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

**Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
Let's assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity since we lack specific information about enrollment rates across all fields. Therefore:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.5 \]

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
We need to estimate how likely Adam's personality traits fit each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Interest in nature and plants is highly relevant.
   - Empathy and love for animals are directly related.
   - Likely to appreciate hard work and dedication.
   - Overall, Adam's traits are highly consistent with this field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoying solving puzzles correlates well with programming and algorithms.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are important.
   - Less direct relationship with curiosity about plants and love for animals.
   - Overall, some traits fit, but less directly.

Given these assessments:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can infer the posterior probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note that these values are not precise calculations but rather informed qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch relative to the fields of study.
