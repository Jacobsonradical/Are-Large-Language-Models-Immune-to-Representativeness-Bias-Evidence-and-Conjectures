Applying Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is essentially a process of updating the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field based on the evidence provided by his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a precise numeric value, it would require specifying prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability of Adam being in each field before seeing the evidence) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each field). Finally, \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence which can be tricky to specify in isolation without comprehensive data.

For the context of this problem, I will use qualitative reasoning to infer relative probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and a warm and empathetic personality.
   - These traits align well with profiles typical of students in agricultural and veterinary sciences, which often require dedication and an appreciation for the natural world.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) is relatively high, and if we assume a reasonable prior probability, \( P(H_{agricultural}) \), the posterior probability should also be on the higher side.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial for computer science.
   - However, the stronger connections to nature, plants, and animals indicate a higher alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences over computer science.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \) would be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary sciences considering his personality traits and interests, while acknowledging that there is still a possibility of him being in computer science given his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
