To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate the following:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing \( E \).

Bayes' Rule can be written as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we're working with a reasonable degree of subjectivity due to the qualitative nature of the description, we'll make some educated estimates for the sake of this exercise.

**Computer Science:**

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): A student in computer science might have interest in puzzles which align with programming, but strong empathy and a deep love for animals are less typical in this field. Hence, let's assume a relatively low probability: 
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \]

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Considering computer science is a popular field, let's assume a prior probability based on graduate enrollments:
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \]

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \( P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \): A student in agricultural and veterinary science would likely have a love for animals, nature, and empathy. This field aligns closely with the personality traits described. Hence, a higher probability:
  \[ P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \approx 0.8 \]

- \( P(H_{\text{AV}}) \): Estimating a lower enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science in comparison to computer science:
  \[ P(H_{\text{AV}}) \approx 0.05 \]

**Normalization Factor \( P(E) \)**:
To normalize and calculate \( P(E) \), we sum over all possible hypotheses, but for simplicity, we will consider normalizing across the two fields only.

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.8 \times 0.05) \approx 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.10
\]

**Posterior Probabilities**:

- For computer science:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.10} = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6
\]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.10} = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4
\]

Thus, the computed posterior probabilities are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
\]
