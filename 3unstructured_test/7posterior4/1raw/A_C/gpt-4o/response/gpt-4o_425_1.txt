To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative estimation rather than an exact numerical value.

### Qualitative Estimation

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): While curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving skills are important for computer science, there is no specific mention of technology affinity or coding skills. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be moderately high but not definitive.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field, so the prior probability \( P(H) \) is relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is very high.
   - \( P(H) \): This field is less popular than computer science in general, so the prior probability \( P(H) \) might be lower than for computer science.

Given this qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect that based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science. Note that actual values require more precise data on priors and likelihoods.
