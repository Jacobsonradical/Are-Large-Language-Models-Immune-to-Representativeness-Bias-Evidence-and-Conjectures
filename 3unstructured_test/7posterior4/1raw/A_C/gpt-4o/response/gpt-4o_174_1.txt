To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and how likely his personality sketch \( E \) is given that he is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

Since we only have qualitative information, I will make reasonable estimations:

1. **Personality match with computer science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit a computer science student's profile. However, his love for nature and animals, as well as his empathy, are less typical. 
     - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as 0.2.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Given that computer science is a common graduate field, we might estimate a higher prior.
     - Let's estimate \( P(H_{CS}) \) as 0.3.
   
2. **Personality match with agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are strong matches. His intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well.
     - Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) as 0.7.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science but still significant.
     - Let's estimate \( P(H_{AVS}) \) as 0.1.

Now for the normalization:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \text{other fields} \]

For simplicity, we will only consider these two fields without detailed normalization over all fields.

Given these estimates:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.3) + (0.7 \times 0.1) \approx 0.11 \]

Now:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.11} \approx 0.545 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.11} \approx 0.636 \]

Thus:

{
  "computer science": 0.545,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636
}
