To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the rule itself:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability: the probability of hypothesis \( H \) (Adam was enrolled in the field) given evidence \( E \) (personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood: the probability of evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability: the initial probability of hypothesis \( H \) without the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood or the probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \) for computer science
- \( H_{AVS} \) for agricultural and veterinary science

To estimate these probabilities:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: How likely are Adam's traits given each field?
   - For computer science \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Computer science students can have a high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles, which aligns with the personality sketch, but the traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less common.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): These traits align very well with the field, given the nature of the work typically involves a love for animals, empathy, and an appreciation of nature.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: How common is each field among graduate students?
   - Let's assume rough estimates based on general knowledge:
     - P(H_{CS}) could be relatively high given the popularity of computer science.
     - P(H_{AVS}) might be lower compared to computer science but non-negligible.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: Likelihood of having the personality sketch in general:
   - This would be hard to estimate without more context, but it's the same normalization factor for both hypotheses.

Now, we provide rough qualitative estimates (exact quantitative calculations would require precise data):

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values are educated guesses based on the fit of Adam's characteristics to each field. The specific affinity for nature, animals, and empathy leans more towards agricultural and veterinary sciences, while the enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence can be traits found in both fields, though slightly less on the nature and animal aspects for computer science.
