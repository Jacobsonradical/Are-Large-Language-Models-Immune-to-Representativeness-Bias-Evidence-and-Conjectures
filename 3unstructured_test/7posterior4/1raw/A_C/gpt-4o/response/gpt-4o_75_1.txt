To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we would typically need information about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since the prompt does not provide explicit values for these components, we must make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Given the nature of Adam's interests and attributes described in the sketch, we can infer the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - These attributes align closely with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - These attributes can align with the field of Computer Science.
   - However, his empathy, love for animals, and nature are less directly aligned but do not exclude the possibility.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be moderate.

Without exact priors and evidences, we would assign posterior probabilities based on these qualitative assessments.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are indicative based on the strength of alignment between Adam's personality sketch and the fields of study. They do not sum to 1 as there are other potential fields of study not accounted for.
