To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would ideally need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each of the given fields, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field, and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since we don't have specific numerical probabilities, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Here's a simplified approach using Bayesian reasoning based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H\_agri):**
   - **P(H\_agri)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science — let's assume a moderate value since it’s not uncommon for people interested in nature and animals.
   - **P(E|H\_agri)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given this field — high, since Adam’s interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy are well-aligned with this field.

2. **Computer Science (H\_cs):**
   - **P(H\_cs)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science — let’s assume a moderate value because it’s a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H\_cs)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch given this field — relatively lower, because while Adam’s intelligence and puzzle-solving ability fit, his deep love for nature and animals may not align as strongly.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the subjective posterior conditional probabilities, noting they do not sum to 1 due to other possible fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

In this case, the values are subjective estimates based on the alignment of Adam’s personality with each field, assuming equal priors. For exact figures, specific data distribution on graduate fields, priors, and likelihoods would be required.
