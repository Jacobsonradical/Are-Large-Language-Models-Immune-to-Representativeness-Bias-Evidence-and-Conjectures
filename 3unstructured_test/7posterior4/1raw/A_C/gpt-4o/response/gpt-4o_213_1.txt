To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down what we need for each hypothesis (field of study):

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) (personality sketch) given the hypothesis \( H \) (field of study).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \). This is the likelihood of someone being in that field of study before observing any additional evidence.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \). This acts as a normalizing constant but will not be directly calculated, as we are interested in comparing the relative probabilities.

Let's calculate \( P(E|H) \) intuitively for each field based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with this field.
   - However, the deep love for nature and animals is not typically aligned with computer science, which might reduce \( P(E|H) \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and strong empathy for animals are strong indicators that match this field.
   - The warm heart and appreciation for hard work also support this hypothesis.

Regarding prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
- Without specific data, we can reasonably assume that the number of students in computer science is generally higher than in agricultural and veterinary science, given current trends in the U.S.

Without precise numeric values for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \), I'll provide a qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that, while both fields align with certain aspects of Adam's personality sketch, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature and animals.
