To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each field of study. However, since we don't have actual data for these, we'll make qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each field) is equal for each category since no prior information is given.

Next, let's qualitatively estimate \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in each field. 

1. **Computer Science**: 
    - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.
    - Enjoyment in solving puzzles could relate to coding and algorithms.
    - Genuine curiosity can denote interest in various computer science topics.
    - Warm heart and empathy are less directly related but don't preclude him from this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is highly relevant.
    - Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are strong indicators towards veterinary science.
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with the demanding nature of this field.
    - High intelligence and abstract thinking apply as well, albeit somewhat differently than in computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we estimate:

\[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.5 \]
\[ P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.8 \]

Assuming equal priors for simplicity (\( P(\text{Computer Science}) = P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \)) and without knowing \( P(E) \) explicitly, we can focus on the ratio of likelihoods as a proxy.

By these assumptions, we present:

{
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Note, these probabilities are qualitative guesses based on the fit of Adam's personality sketch to each field rather than actual calculated probabilities. For accurate results, more detailed statistical data and priors would be needed.
