To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete data for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we must rely on qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam is described as intelligent, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which are traits beneficial for computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field, so there may be a relatively high number of graduate students in this area.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a curiosity about nature, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, which align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This field is more niche compared to computer science but still has a significant proportion of students interested in nature and animals.

Given these considerations and the qualitative nature of the assessment, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities could be:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

The numbers indicate a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science based on the described personality traits related to empathy, nature, and animals. Note that these values are heuristic estimates rather than precise calculations due to the lack of specific data.
