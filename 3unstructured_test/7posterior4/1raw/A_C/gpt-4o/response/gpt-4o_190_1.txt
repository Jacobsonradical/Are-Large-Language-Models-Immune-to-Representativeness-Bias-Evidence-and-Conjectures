To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the normalization factor. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the data provided, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, so we'll make some educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the nature of the fields.

Firstly, let's outline what we believe:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field should be based on general enrollment figures, but in absence of specific data, we assume equal priors for simplicity.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) represents how well the personality sketch (E) fits someone enrolled in each field (H).

### For computer science:

Adam possesses:
- High intelligence
- Good understanding of abstract concepts
- Enjoys solving puzzles

These traits align well with a typical computer science student.

### For agricultural and veterinary science:

Adam possesses:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong love for animals
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align very well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Estimating Likelihoods:

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence (very relevant)
- Good understanding of abstract concepts (very relevant)
- Enjoys solving puzzles (very relevant)

Likelihood \( P(E|CS) \) might be around 0.7.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants (very relevant)
- Strong love for animals (very relevant)
- Warm heart and strong empathy (relevant)
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication (relevant)

Likelihood \( P(E|AVS) \) might be around 0.9.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) = 0.5 for both fields for simplicity:

Now let's combine these into the conditional probabilities:

For \( P(H|E) \):
\[ 
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} 
\]
\[ 
P(AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS)}{P(E)} 
\]

The normalization factor \( P(E) \) will be the same for both and can be ignored for comparative purposes.

Thus:
\[ 
P(CS|E) \propto P(E|CS) \times P(CS) = 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 
\]
\[ 
P(AVS|E) \propto P(E|AVS) \times P(AVS) = 0.9 \times 0.5 = 0.45 
\]

After normalization:
\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.35 + 0.45} = \frac{0.35}{0.80} \approx 0.4375 
\]
\[
P(AVS|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.35 + 0.45} = \frac{0.45}{0.80} \approx 0.5625 
\]

Thus, the results approximate to:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5625
}
```
