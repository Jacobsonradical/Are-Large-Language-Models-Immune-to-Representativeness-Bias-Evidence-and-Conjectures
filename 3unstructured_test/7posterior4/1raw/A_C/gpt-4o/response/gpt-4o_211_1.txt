To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch, we need to consider a few components:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field without considering the personality sketch. We denote these priors as \(P(H_{CS})\) for computer science and \(P(H_{AVS})\) for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** This is the probability of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \(P(E)\):** This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume:

1. The priors are based on general enrollment percentages of graduate students in the U.S. in 2021:
   - Computer science: \(P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2\)
   - Agricultural and veterinary science: \(P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.05\)

2. The likelihoods should reflect how well Adam's personality sketch fits typical students in each field:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to believe he is more likely to be found in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well with computer science, but his specific interest in nature and animals tilts the balance.

So let's assign reasonable likelihoods:
- \(P(E | H_{CS}) \approx 0.3\) 
- \(P(E | H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7\) 

Finally, let's compute \(P(E)\) which is combined for both:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.06 + 0.035 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.095 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.095} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.095} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx 0.63 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AVS} | E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.095} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS} | E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.095} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS} | E) \approx 0.37 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are approximately:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.63",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.37"
}
```
