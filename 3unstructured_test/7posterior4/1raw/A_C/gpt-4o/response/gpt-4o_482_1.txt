To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) for each field (H being computer science or agricultural and veterinary science and E being the personality sketch of Adam), we can use Bayes' rule, which is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \), we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions
1. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (assume equal priors for simplicity due to lack of specific information, say 0.5 for each field).
3. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given the hypothesis.

Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and his genuine curiosity about plants, these attributes align quite well with an agricultural and veterinary science field. His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could align with computer science, but the description seems to better fit agricultural and veterinary science.

### Reasonable Likelihood Estimates
- **P(E|Computer Science)**: This might be lower because the traits of empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not typically associated with computer science, though appreciation for hard work and intelligence align.
- **P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: This could be higher due to the strong alignment of interests and empathy towards animals.

### Simplified Calculation
Let's set some reasonable estimates based on the information:
- **P(E|Computer Science) ≈ 0.3**
- **P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) ≈ 0.7**
- **P(H) for both fields ≈ 0.5**

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

#### Computer Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} \approx \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Ag}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{Ag}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{Ag}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Ag}} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Ag}} \approx \frac{0.35}{P(E)} \]

Since \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields and serves as a normalizing factor, it effectively cancels out when comparing the two probabilities. Thus, the relative probabilities (normalized) are:

### Final Estimates
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This simplified analysis suggests that Adam is more likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
