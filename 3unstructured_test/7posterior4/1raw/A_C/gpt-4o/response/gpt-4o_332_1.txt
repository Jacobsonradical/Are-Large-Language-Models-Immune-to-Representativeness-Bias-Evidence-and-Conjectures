To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to use the following formula:

\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E | H) \), we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of the fields.

For simplicity, assume:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in a given field.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.

### Assumptions and Reasoning:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: Computer science is a common field of study for graduate students, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E | H)_{\text{CS}} \)**: Given Adam’s traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, but less focus on technology-specific interests compared to traditional CS students, we assign a moderate likelihood.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \)**: This field is less common than computer science but still significant, so we can assume a lower prior probability.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E | H)_{\text{AVS}} \)**: Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature correspond very well with this field, so we assign a high likelihood.

Let's quantify these assumptions with reasonable values (note these are illustrative and not based on empirical data):

- \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E | H)_{\text{CS}} = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E | H)_{\text{AVS}} = 0.8 \)

Since:
\[
P(E) = P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E | H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + \text{other fields}
\]

For illustration, normalize \( P(E) \), ignoring "other fields" due to lack of specific data:

\[
P(E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.3 + 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.15 + 0.08 = 0.23
\]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:

### Computer Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.23} \approx 0.652
\]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.23} \approx 0.348
\]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.652,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.348
}
\]
