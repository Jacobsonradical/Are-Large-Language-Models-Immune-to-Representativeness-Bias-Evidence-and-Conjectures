To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first identify the components of Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Let's keep in mind that we don't have precise numerical values for these probabilities, so we'll need to make educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch and typical distributions in graduate fields.

### For Computer Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Let's denote this as the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in computer science (CS). Given the high demand for CS studies, let’s assume \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.25 \) (this is an arbitrary but reasonable assumption).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Considering Adam’s traits like high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts, these are very relevant to CS, but his strong love for nature and animals is less directly relevant. Thus, let’s assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields. It could be a combination of many fields, let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \) (since other fields can also explain his traits).

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.5} = 0.15 \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: Let’s denote this as the probability that any given graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (AVS). Let’s assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \) considering fewer students traditionally enroll in AVS compared to CS.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: Given Adam’s traits—love for nature, plants, and animals, and strong empathy—these are highly relevant to AVS. Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: We assume \( P(E) = 0.5 \) as before.

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.5} = 0.07 \]

So, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```
