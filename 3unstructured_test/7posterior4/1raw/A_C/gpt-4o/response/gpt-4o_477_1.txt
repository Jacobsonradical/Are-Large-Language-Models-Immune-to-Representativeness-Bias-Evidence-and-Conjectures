To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), and the evidence in totality \( P(E) \). However, the actual numeric computation would require more data on priors and likelihoods than is provided in the question.

Since precise probabilities aren't available, we should use qualitative reasoning to inform our answers. Here’s how we can approach it:

1. **P(E|H):** How likely is it that a person with Adam's characteristics would be found in each field?
2. **P(H):** The general likelihood of a student being enrolled in each field as a graduate student in 2021.

Given the details, let's make reasonable qualitative estimates.

**1. Agricultural and veterinary science:**
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. These attributes align very well with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Based on Adam’s stated interests and characteristics, \( P(E|H) \) would be high for this field, making the posterior probability high as well.

**2. Computer science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence which suits well for abstract concepts often dealt with in computer science.
- However, other attributes such as empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants do not strongly relate to computer science.
- Therefore, while \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is not negligible due to problem-solving skills and intelligence, it would be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's approximate these probabilities qualitatively:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values suggest that while both fields are possible for Adam, agricultural and veterinary science is significantly more likely given his personality sketch.
