To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we can't give exact numerical values but can provide a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch and educated guesses.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that Adam is in a given field without considering the personality sketch. Typically, one would look at general enrollment statistics for graduate students in various fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in a particular field of study. Here, we qualitatively assess how well the personality traits fit with common profiles in each field:

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is highly relevant.
     - Warm heart and deep love for animals is highly relevant.
     - Strong empathy and dedication align well with the typical traits in this field.

     Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high for agricultural and veterinary science.

   - **Computer Science**:
     - Enjoying solving puzzles aligns well.
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are common in this field.
     - Quiet nature can also be a common trait.

     However, the connection to nature, plants, and empathy towards animals is less direct.

     Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate for computer science.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is a normalization constant ensuring probabilities sum to 1 over all possible fields. Given we're only looking at two fields, we can compare relative likelihoods.

Based on these qualitative assessments, let's approximate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values qualitatively reflect that Adam's personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, although we recognize he could potentially fit into either field.
