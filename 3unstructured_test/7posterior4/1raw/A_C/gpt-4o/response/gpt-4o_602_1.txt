To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the evidence. However, since we don't have empirical data or detailed priors, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence \( E \) is a normalizing constant and will be the same for all fields. Since we are comparing probabilities, we can omit it in relative comparisons.
- \( P(H) \): Priors are typically based on general knowledge of the distribution of graduate students across fields. We can assume equal priors if we lack specific information, or adjust them based on some common knowledge.
- \( P(E|H) \): This is the likelihood of having Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in a particular field. This will vary based on how well the personality sketch aligns with typical traits expected in each field.

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

**Computer Science:**
- Interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence are traits commonly associated with computer science.
- Curiosity about nature and empathy are less commonly emphasized in this field.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature explicitly align with this field.
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are also important but are not unique to this field.

### Solution:

Without specific numeric priors or data, we'll use a qualitative comparison based on the traits and assumed priors.

Since agricultural and veterinary science aligns more closely with multiple traits in Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are illustrative based on qualitative alignment, and actual probabilities would require empirical data for precise calculation.
