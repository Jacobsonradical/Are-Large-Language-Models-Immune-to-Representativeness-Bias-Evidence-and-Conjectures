To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given hypotheses using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information. Specifically, Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \), I'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical characteristics of students in the mentioned fields and Adam's personality traits.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \):**
   Assuming an equal prior probability for each field might not be accurate, but without specific data, we can start with this assumption.

2. **Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts make this field a reasonable match. However, his love for nature, animals, and strong empathy may not be typical traits strongly associated with computer science students.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align with this field.

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \):**
   The evidence \( E \) is constant across all hypotheses, so for comparison purposes, we can treat it as a normalizing constant.

### Bayesian Update
Given that assumptions need to be made about the likelihoods, we can subjectively assign values:

- For Computer Science, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low because although Adam's intelligence aligns with this field, the strong empathy and love for animals are less typical.
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \( P(E|H) \) might be quite high since Adam's traits align very well with this field.

### Estimation
Let's assign subjective likelihoods and then normalize:

- \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8 \)

Assuming equal priors, \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.5 \), and ignoring the normalization factor since we are comparing the fields directly.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \propto P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \propto P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \]

Summing these to get the normalization constant:
\[ \text{Normalization constant} = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Normalizing:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

### Result
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These are subjective probabilities based on the assumed likelihoods and priors. Further refinement would require actual statistical data.
