To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) as well as the evidence \( P(E) \), it's challenging to provide exact numerical probabilities. Instead, we can make educated guesses based on the given data and typical characteristics of students in each field.

**Assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch**:
1. A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. A love for animals.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
5. Strong empathy and a warm heart.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals.
- Empathy and a warm heart are highly relevant for working with animals.
- This field might not emphasize abstract concepts and puzzles as much as computer science.

### Computer Science
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science.
- Less alignment with nature, plants, and animals.

Given these alignments, we might reasonably assign higher relative probabilities to agricultural and veterinary science than to computer science.

### Estimations
1. Assume \( P(H \text{ (agricultural and veterinary science)}) = 0.3 \)
2. Assume \( P(H \text{ (computer science)}) = 0.1 \)

**Relative Likelihoods**:
- \( P(E| H \text{ (agricultural and veterinary science)}) = 0.7 \) (high, because of the alignment with Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals)
- \( P(E| H \text{ (computer science)}) = 0.5 \) (moderate, because of the alignment with solving puzzles and abstract concepts)

**Evidence**:
- \( P(E) \) can be complex to calculate without more information; however, we use the relative likelihoods to dictate the posterior probabilities.

Given the relative alignments and speculative nature of these assumptions:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) &\approx 0.5, \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) &\approx 0.3.
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence, our approximate estimates while considering the background information:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Note: The actual probabilities will require more precise prior probabilities and likelihoods to accurately compute.
