To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) and hypothesis \( H \) about Adam's field of study, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

### Estimations and Assumptions

1. **Priors \( P(H) \):**
   - These priors depend on the general popularity of each field among graduate students in the U.S.
   - Suppose there is no specific data; we might assume some general reasonable priors based on commonality.

   Let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Based on personality sketch \( E \).
   - For computer science \( H \):
     - Traits like high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well. Likelihood could be high.
     - Assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.6 \)
   - For agricultural and veterinary science \( H \):
     - Strong alignment due to curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
     - Assume \( P(E|\text{agriculture and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \)

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):**
   - This is complex to calculate precisely without full data on distribution.
   - Can be approximated as the sum of contributions of all hypotheses:
     - \( P(E) \approx P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agriculture and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agriculture and veterinary science}) + \text{other contributions} \)
     - Simplifying and assuming priors cover most popular fields give us some rough margin \( P(E) \approx 0.205 \).

Thus, let's plug values in using some simplification for illustrative purpose:

1. **Computer Science \( H \):**
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.205} \approx 0.585 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( H \):**
   \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.205} \approx 0.220 \)

### Result:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.585",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.220"
}
```
(Note: simplified assumption. Real data may adjust priors and likelihoods.)
