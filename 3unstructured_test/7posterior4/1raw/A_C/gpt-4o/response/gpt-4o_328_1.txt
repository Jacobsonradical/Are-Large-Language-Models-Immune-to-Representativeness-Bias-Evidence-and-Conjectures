To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of each field and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Here is the general form of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's outline a qualitative approach to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general likelihood of a graduate student being in a specific field. 
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality sketch given he is in that field.

Given that we do not have specific numerical values or detailed prior probabilities, I will provide estimated values based on the qualitative assessment:

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume a moderate prior probability.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's strong intelligence and abstract thinking align well with computer science. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature may not strongly indicate computer science. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less commonly chosen compared to computer science, so the prior might be lower.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are highly indicative of a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, letâ€™s provide estimated values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these values are qualitatively estimated based on the given personality sketch and the general perception of the alignment between the personality traits and the fields.
