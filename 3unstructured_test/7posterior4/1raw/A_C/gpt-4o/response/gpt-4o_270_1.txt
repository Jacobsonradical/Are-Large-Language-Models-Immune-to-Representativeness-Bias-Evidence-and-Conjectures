To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch and information about Adam (E), let's assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science). We need to estimate these values based on the described traits of Adam:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: not a primary trait of computer science students, so low.
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: high, as this aligns with traits common in computer science students.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: neutral, not directly related.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: high.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: high.

   Estimated \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: 0.3 (higher than the baseline but not the predominant fit)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: very high, as this is directly relevant.
   - Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: mild, could be relevant for research-focused students.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: very high, this is central to veterinary science.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: high.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: high.

   Estimated \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.7 (most traits align well)

Now, consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
   - Assume there are more students in computer science programs than in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - Let \( P(H) \) (computer science) = 0.6
   - Let \( P(H) \) (agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.2
   (This is a hypothetical assignment for illustration, the actual values could differ based on data.)

Lastly, \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be considered as a normalization factor here.

Using Bayes' rule, the posterior probabilities for the specific fields can be calculated as:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|\text{CS},E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.6}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|\text{AVS},E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Without the exact value of \( P(E) \), we compare the numerators of the above equations to get the relative likelihoods:

\[ \begin{aligned}
P(H|\text{CS},E) & = 0.18 / P(E) \\
P(H|\text{AVS},E) & = 0.14 / P(E) 
\end{aligned} \]

Relative likelihood comparison:

\[
\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.14} \approx 0.56 \\
\frac{0.14}{0.18 + 0.14} \approx 0.44 \\
\]

So the approximate posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
```

This means Adam is a bit more likely to be in computer science, but there is still a significant chance he could be in agricultural and veterinary science.
