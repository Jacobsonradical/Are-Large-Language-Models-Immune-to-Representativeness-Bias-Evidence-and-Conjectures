To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to remember that the rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis, \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence, and \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses. Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for the different fields based on graduate student populations, we will make reasonable qualitative estimations rather than precise calculations.

Given Adamâ€™s personality traits, we can make the following estimations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - \(P(E|H)\): High, because his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate, assuming that a non-trivial portion of graduate students might be enrolled in this field.
   - Consequently, \(P(H|E)\) would also be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**

   - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate, because his interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - \(P(H)\): High, as computer science is a popular field among graduate students.
   - Consequently, \(P(H|E)\) would also be significant but possibly not as high as agricultural and veterinary science given his additional fit with nature and animals.

Taking into consideration qualitative factors, here are the estimations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Without exact numerical data, these values are informed estimations reflecting the likely strong fit of his personality with agricultural and veterinary science and a reasonably good fit with computer science.
