To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for the given evidence, and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Since these values are not explicitly provided, I can give a reasoned approach to the likelihoods based on the given evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch):

1. **Computer Science**: This field emphasizes intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving abilities. Adam's attributes, such as high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, align well with a computer science background. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not particularly align with what is commonly associated with computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field relates to nature, plants, and animals. Adam’s deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart, and strong empathy align very well with this field. Additionally, understanding and appreciating hard work and dedication are important traits in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations:
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (Likelihood of E given Adam is in computer science) may be moderate.
- \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) (Likelihood of E given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science) may be high.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors or exact likelihoods, a reasonable estimate for these probabilities, informed by the qualitative alignment of Adam’s traits with the two fields, might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
``` 

These values reflect the significantly stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
