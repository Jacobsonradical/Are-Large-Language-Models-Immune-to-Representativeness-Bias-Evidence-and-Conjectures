To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to express Bayes' rule mathematically:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods (specific statistical data) for Adam’s enrollment in different fields, we need to make reasoned estimates based on the provided information about Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

For "computer science," let's consider:
1. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are traits that align well with computer science.
2. However, his love for nature, plants, and animals, warm heart, and strong empathy might be less directly relevant.

For "agricultural and veterinary science," let's consider:
1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, warm heart, and strong empathy strongly suggest a fit with this field.
2. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work also align well with the demands of this field.

Given these qualitative assessments:

- Let's assign \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is in computer science) a moderately low value due to the mixed relevance of his traits.
- Conversely, \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) (likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science) will be higher owing to the strong alignment.

We don't have exact numerical priors, but hypothetically if we assume uniform priors \( P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{avs}) \), we can focus on the likelihoods:

Let's assign the following estimated conditional probabilities for illustration:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are informed by the compatibility of Adam’s traits with the general demands and characteristics of these fields. Please note that these are subjective estimates and could vary with different additional information or context.
