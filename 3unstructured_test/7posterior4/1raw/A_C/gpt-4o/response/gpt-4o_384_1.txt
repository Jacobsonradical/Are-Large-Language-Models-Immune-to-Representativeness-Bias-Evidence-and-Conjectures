Calculating the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule requires prior probabilities (P(H)) for each hypothesis and the likelihood of observing the personality traits given each field (P(E|H)). Without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, these need to be estimated based on the provided information.

Let's denote:
- \(H_1\) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(H_2\) to be the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We need to compute \(P(H_1|E)\) and \(P(H_2|E)\).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make estimates based on the information provided, although a rigorous scientific approach would typically involve more detailed statistical data.

Qualitative estimations:
- Adam's personality traits, such as a love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- Adam's passion for nature and plants also suggests a strong pull toward agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, I will make the following estimations:

\( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \): Assume equal priors due to lack of specific information on their relative frequencies in the population of graduate students.
\[ P(H_1) \approx P(H_2) \approx 0.5 \]

\( P(E|H_1) \): High, because Adam's traits are highly indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
\[ P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \]

\( P(E|H_2) \): Moderate to high, because although Adam's traits support computer science, they are not as strongly indicative.
\[ P(E|H_2) \approx 0.6 \]

\( P(E) \): This term would be the sum of the marginal probabilities, but for normalization.

Thus,

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5 \left(0.8 + 0.6\right)} \approx \frac{0.4}{0.7} \approx 0.57 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.5 \left(0.8 + 0.6\right)} \approx \frac{0.3}{0.7} \approx 0.43 \]

So, the probabilities are approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.57",
  "computer science": "0.43"
}
```

(Note: These values are estimates based on the provided qualitative information and assumptions.)
