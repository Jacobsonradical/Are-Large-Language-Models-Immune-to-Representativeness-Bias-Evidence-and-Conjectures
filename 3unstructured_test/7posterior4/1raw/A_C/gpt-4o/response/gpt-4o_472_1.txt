To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more details, such as the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field (denoted as \( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of the given personality traits \( E \) being observed given each hypothesis \( H \) (denoted as \( P(E|H) \)). Since we don't have access to those exact probabilities, I'll make reasonable assumptions for the purpose of illustration. 

For Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Given that we don't have specific numbers, we'll estimate based on the description.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities
- Let's assume the following prior probabilities for Adam enrolling in each of the fields, based on general knowledge about common graduate fields:

  \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \)

  \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)

### Assumptions for Likelihoods
- The likelihood \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) should be quite high considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)

- The likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) should be moderate to high given Adam's high intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts.
  
  Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities
We need the normalizing constant \( P(E) \), which can be calculated as:

\[ 
P(E) = \sum_H P(E|H) \cdot P(H) 
\]

For simplicity, I'll include only the two hypotheses here, but note that typically this sum would extend over all possible hypotheses.

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) 
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.3) 
      \approx 0.08 + 0.15 
      \approx 0.23
\]

Now compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.23} \approx 0.348 
\]

For computer science:

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.23} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.23} \approx 0.652 
\]

### Summary
Given our assumptions and computations, the posterior probabilities can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.348,
  "computer science": 0.652
}
```

Please note these values are based on assumed priors and likelihoods. Accurate computation would require actual statistical data.
