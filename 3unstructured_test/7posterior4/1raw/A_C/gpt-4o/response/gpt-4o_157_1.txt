To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute the exact values, we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam choosing a specific field (computer science or agricultural and veterinary science) without any specific evidence \( E \).
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the given personality traits, given that he is in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of Adam having those personality traits across all possible fields.

Since we don't have exact numerical data, we'll rely on qualitative analysis based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior (\( P(H_{CS}) \))**: In general, a significant number of graduate students may pursue computer science, so this prior might be moderately high.
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{CS}) \))**: Given Adam's traits:
     - Curiosity and high intelligence fit well with computer science.
     - Enjoyment of solving puzzles fits especially well.
     - Abstract thinking is crucial in computer science.
     - Warm heart and empathy are less clearly related.
     - Love for nature, plants, and animals could be seen less commonly in computer science contexts.

   Thus, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior (\( P(H_{AVS}) \))**: Fewer students might choose this field compared to computer science generally, so initial guess is the prior might be moderate to low.
   - **Likelihood (\( P(E|H_{AVS}) \))**: Given Adam's traits:
     - Deep love for animals is highly relevant.
     - Understanding and appreciation for nature and plants fits directly.
     - Warm heart and empathy are crucial in these fields as well.
     - High intelligence and curiosity also fit well.
     - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is somewhat relevant for problem-solving in this field.

   Thus, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) might be high.

Now, we'll translate these qualitative assessments into some comparative probabilities. Since the exact calculation would require numerical values and overall distribution, we will provide estimates based on the qualitative evaluation:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

This reflects a higher posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality traits.
