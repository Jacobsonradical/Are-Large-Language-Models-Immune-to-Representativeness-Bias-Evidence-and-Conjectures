To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll first note Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field in general.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which acts as a normalizing factor.

Assuming we don't have exact data on \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam's described personality traits:

1. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is likely high since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work.
   - \( P(H) \) might be relatively low because fewer students choose agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to more popular fields like computer science, but it depends on the population in question.
   
2. For **computer science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate to high because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which suit computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals does not necessarily align with computer science.
   - \( P(H) \) is likely higher compared to agricultural and veterinary science due to the popularity of computer science programs.

Considering these qualitative assessments, let's assign some reasonable probabilities:
- Higher conditional probability for agricultural and veterinary science because of a strong match with his interests.
- Lower to moderate conditional probability for computer science due to the mismatch in some personal interests but fitting intellectual traits.

Based on this reasoning, we can assign hypothetical probabilities. Note: these are illustrative and not based on actual statistical data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This output reflects the tailored alignment of Adam's character traits more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, while also acknowledging his intellectual fit for computer science.
