To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of the hypothesis without considering the evidence. For simplicity, we can assume that every graduate field has an equal prior probability, although in real scenarios this could be more refined.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. We need to estimate how likely it is for Adam's personality sketch to be observed if he is in each field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the evidence across all fields.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make some qualitative observations for each field to simplify the likelihood assessments:

- **Computer Science:**
  - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts strongly support the likelihood (high \( P(E|H) \)).
  - Curiosity about nature and plants, while possible, is less central to the typical profile of computer science (moderate-to-low \( P(E|H) \)).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are strongly aligned (high \( P(E|H) \)).
  - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well (high \( P(E|H) \)).

Let's assume equal priors \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for simplicity, given we are only comparing these two fields. Thus, we will focus primarily on the likelihoods:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.3 \] (higher for a few traits like intelligence and abstract concepts)

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \] (most traits align well)

Now apply Bayes' rule in a simplified manner:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \)
}

Since \( P(E) \) is the same and cancels out when comparing, we can simplify:

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.3 \times 0.5 + 0.9 \times 0.5} \approx 0.25 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{0.3 \times 0.5 + 0.9 \times 0.5} \approx 0.75 \)
}

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}
