To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we do not have specific empirical data, we will make reasoned assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the information provided about Adam, let's assume the following for simplicity:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science. For simplicity, we can assume equal priors or base the priors on typical enrollment figures in the U.S.
- \( P(E|H) \) will be derived from how well Adam's personality matches each field.

Given Adam's deep love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and high intelligence, let's assume:
- \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.4 \)

Assuming equal priors for simplicity:
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \)

We can calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E| \text{computer science}) P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \times 0.5) + (0.4 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 + 0.2 = 0.55 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' rule to find the posterior probabilities:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.55} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) \approx 0.636 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{P(E| \text{computer science}) P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{0.55} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) \approx 0.364 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636,
  "computer science": 0.364
}
