To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, we employ Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of that personality sketch.

Since we don't have the actual statistical data, we need to make some educated estimates based on the information provided. Let's break down the reasoning for each field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students. Suppose the prior \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are not particularly aligned with typical traits.
     - Estimated \( P(E|H) \): 0.3 (30%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than computer science. Suppose the prior \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals fit extremely well with agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Estimated \( P(E|H) \): 0.7 (70%).

Now, we need an estimated overall probability \( P(E) \), the normalization factor which is essentially the sum of \( P(E|H)P(H) \) over all possible hypotheses.

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{AVS})P(\text{AVS}) + \text{other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \times 0.2) + (0.7 \times 0.05) + \text{other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.035 + \text{other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.095 + \text{other fields} \]

For simplicity, we won't compute the exact \( P(E) \) but will estimate it for relative comparison purposes.

Now applying Bayes' rule for each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{0.095 + \text{other fields}} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.095 + \text{other fields}} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.095 + \text{other fields}} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.095 + \text{other fields}} \]

To provide approximate values assuming \( \text{other fields} \) account for a non-negligible portion but not overly dominant:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.6 + \text{other fields}} \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.6 + \text{other fields}} \approx 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
