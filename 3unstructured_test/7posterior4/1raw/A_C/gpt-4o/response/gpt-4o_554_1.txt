To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, you'd update prior knowledge about the likelihood of Adam being in a given field with the new evidence provided by his personality sketch, E.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For practical purposes in this context, without concrete prior probabilities and evidence probabilities, I'll rely on the qualitative evaluation based on the described interests and characteristics.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H): Prior probability based on the popularity of the field.
   - P(E|H): How likely it is to observe Adam's characteristics if he were studying this field.
   - Adam has high intelligence and loves solving puzzles, which aligns well with computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H): Prior probability based on how common this field is among graduate students.
   - P(E|H): Adam's genuine interest in nature, plants, and a deep love for animals fit very well with this field.

Given the qualitative aspects of Adam's personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values are educated estimates based on the alignment of Adam's interests and characteristics with typical attributes observed in students of these respective fields. Agricultural and veterinary science are given a higher probability due to the stronger match with his empathy and deep love for animals, as well as his interest in nature and plants.
