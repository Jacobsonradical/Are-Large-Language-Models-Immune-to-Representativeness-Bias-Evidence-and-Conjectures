To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the same for both comparisons.

Given that actual numerical values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided in the question, we have to make educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- **Prior probability**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in a particular field based on typical graduate enrollment distributions.
- **Likelihood**: This is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.

Without specific data, we'll make general assumptions:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \) for computer science might be based on general enrollment statistics in U.S. graduate programs.
   - \( P(H_{avs}) \) for agricultural and veterinary science might be based on the same.

Let's assume for general graduate programs:
- The prior probability \( P(H_{cs}) \approx 0.30 \) (since computer science is a popular field).
- The prior probability \( P(H_{avs}) \approx 0.10 \) (since it's more specialized).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Given the provided personality sketch, Adam's interests in nature, animals, puzzles, and abstract concepts seem somewhat aligned but not strongly indicative of computer science. Let's estimate this at \( 0.1 \).
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H_{avs}) \): The personality sketch aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science due to strong empathy, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's estimate this at \( 0.4 \).

3. **Evidence**:
   - The evidence \( P(E) \) can be computed as a normalization constant but isn't necessary for relative comparison between fields.

Using Bayes' rule:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.30}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.03 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) \propto 0.04 \]

While the absolute probabilities cannot be pinpointed without \( P(E) \), the relative likelihoods indicate that Adam's personality sketch is more aligned with **agricultural and veterinary science** compared to **computer science**.

Let's normalize these values to give a clearer comparison:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.04} \approx 0.4286 \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.03 + 0.04} \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
