To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider multiple elements:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that the subject is in each field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that the personality sketch \( E \) would be observed given the hypothesis \( H \) about the field of study.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), I'll provide a qualitative evaluation that assigns a relative likelihood to each field based on the provided personality sketch.

### Given Personality Sketch (E) Analysis:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**.
- **Strong empathy and a deep love for animals**.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**.
- **Warm heart and a quiet, puzzle-solving nature**.
- **Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication**.

### Field-specific Evaluation:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): While the abstract and puzzle-solving nature fits well with computer science, the aspects related to a love for animals and nature are less characteristic.
   - Prior, \( P(H) \): Computer science is a highly popular field, so the prior might be relatively high.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \): The love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and strong empathy align very well with this field.
   - Prior, \( P(H) \): This field is less wide-ranging compared to computer science but is highly relevant given the personality characteristics.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can make rough estimations of the probabilities.

### Results in Required Format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.2)**: Although the subject's abstract thinking and puzzle-solving abilities are suitable for computer science, his intense interest in nature and animals makes this field less likely.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.8)**: The subject's empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature strongly suggest this field, making it a more likely choice. 

Note: These values are illustrative based on qualitative assessment and relative likelihood, not exact calculations. For exact values, one would need specific data on the base rates (priors) and the likelihoods.
