To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume we don't have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the total evidence probability \( P(E) \). Therefore, we will make informed guesses based on the description provided and common knowledge about the fields.

**Assumptions and estimations:**

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Let's assume the general interest in computer science among graduate students is relatively high. So, let's assign a prior of 0.3.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's profile:
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance for Computer Science.
     - Solving puzzles: Moderate to high relevance.
     - Warm heart and empathy: Neutral to low relevance.
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science to be around 0.1.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Let's assume the interest in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate among graduate students. So, let's assign a prior of 0.1 (as it is less popular than fields like Computer Science).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Considering Adam's profile:
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: Very high relevance.
     - Solving puzzles: Moderate relevance.
     - Warm heart and empathy: High relevance.
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science to be around 0.7.

Now using these estimates:

For **Computer Science**, assuming \( P(H|CS) \):
\[ P(H|CS) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|CS) \propto 0.03 \]
Since we lack \( P(E) \), the exact value can't be calculated, but we will prioritize relative strength.

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, assuming \( P(H|AVS) \):
\[ P(H|AVS) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|AVS) \propto 0.07 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities relative to each other would be:

{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

For normalization purpose, considering the above rough calculation (yet not needing to add to 1):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
