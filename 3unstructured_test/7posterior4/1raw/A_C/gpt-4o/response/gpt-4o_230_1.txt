To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to perform an analysis using Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field based on the evidence (personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam enrolling in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence, a normalizing constant.

We will need to make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities as we don't have exact data. These assumptions are:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam's enrollment in particular fields (these can be based on general enrollment statistics).
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of having the personality traits given the enrollment in the respective fields.

Let's denote our assumptions and reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, it is relatively likely.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for this field is high, say 0.8.
    - Priors: This is a less common field compared to computer science, so assume \( P(H) \) is around 0.05.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - Although Adam has high intelligence and abstract thinking skills, which are favorable for computer science, his other traits (empathy, love for animals) don't strongly align with this field.
    - Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for this field is moderate, say 0.3.
    - Priors: This is a very common and popular field, so assume \( P(H) \) is around 0.2.

For both fields, we can assume \( P(E) = 1 \) as it serves as a normalizing constant.

Now let's plug these into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agr.vet}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{agr.vet}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agr.vet}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{1} = 0.04 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{comp.sci}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{comp.sci}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{comp.sci}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.06 \]

Thus:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}

These values reflect the likelihood of Adam being in each field given his personality traits and some reasonable assumptions on prior and conditional probabilities.
