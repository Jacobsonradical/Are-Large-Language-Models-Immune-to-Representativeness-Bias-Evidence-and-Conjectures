To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd typically need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihood values, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_1|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(H_2|E) \) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given the personality sketch \( E \).

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \):
   - Let's assume that without any additional information, there's an equal likelihood of Adam being in any given field. Since we have no information suggesting otherwise, we'll assume prior probabilities are equal.

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work increase the likelihood.
   - For computer science, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts increase the likelihood.
   
### Tentative Likelihood Values:
- \( P(E|H_1) \) (agricultural and veterinary science) should be relatively high due to the alignment of interests and traits.
- \( P(E|H_2) \) (computer science) should also be relatively high because of Adam's intellectual traits.

Since we don't have exact numeric values, let's assign tentative probabilities based on qualitative assessment.

### Calculations (Qualitative Estimate):
Assuming equal priors \( P(H_1) = P(H_2) = 0.5 \), and assigning likelihood weights intuitively:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values are estimates based on the stronger alignment of Adam's interests and traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, despite both fields having some degree of relevance.
