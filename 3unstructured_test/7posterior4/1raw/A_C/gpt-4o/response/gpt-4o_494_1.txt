To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for prior probabilities or likelihoods in this case, we'll need to qualitatively assess how well each hypothesis aligns with the given evidence and make reasonable assumptions.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **P(E|H):** High; Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits well.
2. **P(H):** Reasonable; Agricultural and veterinary science are common graduate fields.
3. **P(E):** Evidence aligns strongly with this field.

### Computer Science
1. **P(E|H):** Moderate; Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence fit, but his love for nature and animals doesn't align strongly with this field.
2. **P(H):** High; Computer science is a popular field among graduate students.
3. **P(E):** Evidence partially aligns.

Let's reason the qualitative likelihoods into rough probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values reflect a higher probability that Adam is in a field closely related to his expressed interests in nature and animals, and a reasonable chance that his aptitude for puzzles and intelligence could align him with computer science, but to a lesser extent.
