To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H, the prior probability of H, and the evidence E. 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the specific prior probabilities (P(H) and P(E)), so we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the presented personality traits and graduate fields. We'll consider the fit between Adam's personality and the fields of agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science.

### Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a love for animals.
Based on the personality sketch, these are strong indicators that Adam fits well with this field.

2. **Computer Science (H2)**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
While his puzzle-solving ability and intelligence might suggest a fit for computer science, the emphasis on his love for nature, plants, and animals makes this less likely.

### Estimations:
Given Adam's strong connection to nature and animals, it's more plausible that the probability of him being in the field of agricultural and veterinary science is higher than in computer science. To give approximate values:

Let's assume the following probabilities for the sake of answering the question:

### Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.8 \) (High likelihood since many traits match well)
- \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.4 \) (Moderate likelihood since some traits match, but not as well)

### Priors:
- \( P(H1) \approx 0.2 \) (Assume a lower overall graduate enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(H2) \approx 0.25 \) (Assume a moderately higher enrollment in computer science)

### Evidence:
Assume \( P(E) \) is simply normalizing (irrelevant for comparative purposes).

### Posterior Probabilities:
Now applying Bayes' rule approximately and proportionally:
- \( P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \)
- \( P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.10 \)

### Normalized For Comparative Purposes:
Sum of these proportions = \( 0.16 + 0.10 = 0.26 \)

- \( P(H1|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.26} \approx 0.615 \)
- \( P(H2|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.26} \approx 0.385 \)

So the final approximate conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615,
  "computer science": 0.385
}
```

These values indicate that based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, though not exclusively so.
