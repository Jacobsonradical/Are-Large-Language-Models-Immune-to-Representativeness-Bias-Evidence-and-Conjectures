To apply Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these, we will estimate these probabilities based on the given information.

Bayes' rule is expressed as:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to evaluate how well the description of Adam fits with each hypothesis.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a love for animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits align strongly with this field.

**Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence. While these traits are relevant, his deep love for nature, plants, and animals, and strong empathy might not directly suggest computer science as much as agricultural and veterinary science.

We will assume:
- \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) have some prior probability.
- \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) could be roughly equal without other information.

Given that Adam's personality sketch fits better with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science based on the information provided, we can estimate higher likelihood for \( P(E|H_1) \) than \( P(E|H_2) \).

Without exact probabilities, but following the reasoning above, the posterior probabilities could be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimated values are subjective and based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise quantitative data. The likelihood that Adam's traits fit the field of agricultural and veterinary science is higher than that for computer science.
