To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either Computer Science or Agricultural and Veterinary Science, we need to apply Bayes' Rule. However, to do this correctly, we typically need specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) representing how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is for each field \( H \). Because these exact values are not provided, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):** We'll assume that initially, the probability of Adam being in any specific graduate field of specialization is relatively uniform, but we might slightly favor something related to nature and empathy for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
  
2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):** Based on the description of Adam's personality, he has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, a love for animals, and strong empathy, which makes it more likely for him to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. The traits of high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts do apply to Computer Science, but the other characteristics don't strongly align with that field.

Thus, while exact numerical values cannot be pinpointed precisely without more data, the qualitative consideration gives us a way to estimate the probabilities.

### Posterior Probabilities
Given our qualitative assessment:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{Agr}) \): High, because his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature and plants strongly suggest this field.
  - \( P(H_{Agr}) \): Reasonable, but likely higher due to his specific personality traits aligning with this field.

- For **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Medium to low, only high intelligence and abstract thinking suggest this field.
  - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior is okay, but weaker match with the personality traits.

Using these qualitative measures to make rough quantitative guesses:

\[ P(H_{Agr}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{Agr}) \cdot P(H_{Agr})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Given the high fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science and a less strong fit for Computer Science:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These probabilities are rough estimates and aim to reflect the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality with the fields in question. Real Bayesian computation would require precise values for priors and likelihoods.
