To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam (denoted as \( E \)), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule for computing \( P(H|E) \) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field nor the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the described characteristics and their alignment with the typical traits expected in each field. We'll assume equal priors for each field for simplicity. Thus, the comparison will mainly hinge on \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the personality sketch given the field.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem to align more with someone in agricultural and veterinary science but can have some alignment with computer science due to Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills.

### Estimated Values:
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High, due to alignment with love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and hard work.
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Moderate, due to the alignment with intelligence and problem-solving but less fit with empathy towards animals and curiosity about nature.

With these considerations, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities (keeping in mind that we are working with subjective assumptions rather than exact data).

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher alignment of Adam's personality sketch with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
