To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Evidence (E)**: Interest in nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: High, given Adam's traits align with this field.
   - **Prior (P(H))**: Given Adam's traits, we can reasonably assume this field is more likely because it involves nature, animals, and hard work.
   
   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \approx 0.8 \) and \( P(H_{agriculture}) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Evidence (E)**: High intelligence, good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Moderate to high, though not all traits align specifically with computer science.
   - **Prior (P(H))**: This field can also align with some of Adam's traits like intelligence and puzzle-solving.

   Let's assume \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \approx 0.5 \) and \( P(H_{computer\_science}) \approx 0.2 \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses (it represents how likely we are to observe Adam's personality sketch in general), we'll ignore it for relative comparison.

Using these assumptions:

\[
P(H_{agriculture}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture}) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(H_{computer\_science}|E) \propto P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \cdot P(H_{computer\_science}) = 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1
\]

Now, we normalize these values to ensure they are in the desired range. However, as we are asked for specific values (not necessarily to be normalized as they won't add up to 1 due to other fields):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.1
