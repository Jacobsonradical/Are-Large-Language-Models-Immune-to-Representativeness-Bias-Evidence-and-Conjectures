To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Bayes' Rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- \( P(E|H) \) - Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given each field.
- \( P(E) \) - The marginal likelihood of the evidence, which is the same across all fields when computing probabilities for comparison.

Since we don't have empirical data, we'll make some educated guesses based on the information about Adam.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals make it quite likely he could be in this field.
2. **Computer Science**: His high intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles suggest he could also be in this field, although his love for animals and nature might make it slightly less likely.

Let's define our terms:
- \( P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \) = Prior probability of enrolling in agricultural and veterinary science = 0.1 (guessing based on the number of different possible fields)
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) = Prior probability of enrolling in computer science = 0.1 (another field, assuming equal prior probability distribution across fields)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam’s personality in agricultural and veterinary science = 0.8 (high due to relevance)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) = Probability of observing Adam’s personality in computer science = 0.6 (moderate due to puzzle and abstract concept understanding)

Bayes' Rule application:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri-vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri-vet}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, it's factored out when comparing only the two but not computed here since we care about the relative magnitudes:

So,

\[ P(H_{\text{agri-vet}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.1 = 0.06 \]

Therefore,

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
