To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch \(E\), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and full knowledge of the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) for each field, we must make reasonable assumptions to progress. Letâ€™s denote the following:

- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) = prior probability Adam is studying Computer Science.
- \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\) = prior probability Adam is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) = likelihood of Adam's traits given he is studying Computer Science.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\) = likelihood of Adam's traits given he is studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

For this example:

1. Given Adam's "genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals," we might assume \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\) is quite high.
2. His "quiet nature and intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts" fits reasonably with traits needed for Computer Science, so \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) is also not negligible but likely lower for the nature and animals given.

Assuming we use hypothetical values:
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}})\) = 0.2 (since Computer Science is a common field)
- \(P(H_{\text{AVS}})\) = 0.05 (a less common field but more fitting with the traits)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) = 0.3 (traits somewhat aligning with Computer Science)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})\) = 0.7 (traits strongly aligning with Agricultural and Veterinary Science)

The tricky part is \(P(E)\), but for determining relative likelihoods:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + \ldots \]

Focusing on relative proportions, we compare the numerator parts:

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]

From here, to give a normalized comparison:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.06 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.035 \]

So, relative likelihoods make Agricultural and Veterinary Science reasonable but with some preference for more specific comparisons:

{
  "computer science": 0.10 to 0.20 (considering relative nature component separately),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.30 to 0.50
}

These values could entail more granularity with exact or domain-specific Bayesian settings. The proportionate differences imply higher fitment to Agricultural and Veterinary but not negligible other field fitments like Computer Science.

Real estimates refine more with specific domain priors and exact computation but reflect nature in affinity scales.
