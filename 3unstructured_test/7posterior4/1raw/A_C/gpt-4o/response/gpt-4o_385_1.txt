To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the lack of specific numerical probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will resort to qualitative reasoning to estimate the probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**: The field of computer science typically involves individuals with a strong understanding of abstract concepts and intelligence, which aligns with Adam's profile. However, there is no direct mention of a curiosity for nature, plants, animals, or empathy specifically related to computer science. Therefore, while it's possible, it may not be the strongest match for his personality sketch.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and warm heart. A deep love for animals and a strong appreciation for hard work match closely with the typical characteristics of someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can reasonably estimate:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
