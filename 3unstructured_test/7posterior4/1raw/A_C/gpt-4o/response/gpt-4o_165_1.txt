To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Without specific data on the prior probabilities and likelihoods, exact numerical values cannot be determined. However, we can provide a qualitative reasoning estimate based on the given personality sketch and fields of study.

### Qualitative Analysis:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. This aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a higher likelihood for this field.
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits beneficial in computer science, but the sketch emphasizes a greater connection to nature and animals.

### Estimation:
Without numerical values, I can provide plausible estimates that reflect these qualitative insights:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7, // Higher likelihood based on Adam's interests
  "computer science": 0.3  // Lower, but still conceivable given his puzzle-solving enjoyment
}
```

These values are not calculated but inferred from the alignment of traits and interests with the respective fields of study.
