To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

For this particular problem, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, so we will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:
- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are assumed to be roughly equal, as we don't have any additional information suggesting otherwise.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is where we will distinguish between the fields based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Estimations:
- For **computer science**:
  - Given Adam's high intelligence, interest in solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is notably high.
  - However, his strong empathy and love for nature are less directly related to typical computer science traits.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
  - These factors make \( P(E|H) \) particularly high for this field.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

### Justification:
- Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly boost the likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities match well with computer science, the other aspects of his personality less strongly align.
- Thus, the posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher.
