To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: the likelihood that Adam is enrolled in a particular field before considering his personality traits.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: the probability that Adam's personality traits would be observed given that he is enrolled in that field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information in the personality sketch, we can make some educated guesses regarding the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field and the priors \( P(H) \). However, without detailed prior probabilities and the evidence for each field, we will need to make reasonable assumptions to illustrate the computation.

**Assumptions:**
1. Letâ€™s assume the base rate probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields are equal for simplicity, so \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for each field.
2. For \( P(E|H) \), we consider the traits (curiosity about nature, animals, intelligence, empathy) to be more aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) than Computer Science (CS).

### Approximate Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\text{AVS}) \): High, because the traits align well with interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
- \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): Moderate, as the focus is on abstract thinking and puzzles, but less on nature and animals.

Given these assumptions, let's hypothetically approximate the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \)

### Evidence P(E):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) + P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.4 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.6} = \frac{0.4}{0.6} \approx 0.67 \]

#### For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{0.6} = \frac{0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.33 \]

Here's the final answer in the requested format:
