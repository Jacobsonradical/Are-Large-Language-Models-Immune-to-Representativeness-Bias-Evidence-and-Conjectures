To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, we don't have access to all the exact numerical data, so we will have to approximate based on common assumptions.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's outline the assumptions we'll make for each field:

1. **Priors \( P(H) \):** We’ll assume the prior probability for each field has a relatively wide distribution, given that graduate students can be found across various fields.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):** Some aspects of Adam’s personality sketch match more closely with certain fields, and we'll factor these into our likelihoods.

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let’s assume graduate programs in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science have equal standing. So each may have prior \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The key traits here are high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, which are crucial in computer science. However, the curiosity about nature and love for animals fits less well.
  
  \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Similar prior probability assumed as computer science.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and warm heart align very strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

  \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)

Given these assumptions:

### Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)
Since we don't have exact probability distribution for \( P(E) \), we'll use approximate normalization based on our likelihoods.

Now, let's calculate based on these assumed values:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.15}{0.4} \approx 0.375 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.35}{0.4} \approx 0.875 \]

Based on these rough estimates, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875
}
```

These values provide a rough idea indicating a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
