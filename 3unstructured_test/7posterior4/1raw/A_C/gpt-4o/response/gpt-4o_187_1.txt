To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to keep in mind that Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability, the initial probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given the information, let's enumerate some assumptions for prior probabilities and likelihoods, since weâ€™re not provided with explicit numerical values:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field:
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Assume a reasonable value, say 0.1.
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \): Assume a reasonable value, say 0.15.

2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science might be higher because of his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Let's assume 0.7.
   - The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given enrollment in computer science may be less because computer science typically emphasizes abstract thinking and puzzle-solving, but it doesn't align strongly with interest in nature and animals. Let's assume 0.3.

3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): This represents the probability of the evidence over all possible hypotheses. To simplify, let's assume it to be a normalizing constant that ensures probabilities across all possible fields sum to 1. Since we're only considering these two fields, without more fields it can't be calculated directly here.

Using these numbers, compute \( P(H|E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

Without knowing \( P(E) \), these values are:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \]

These probabilities on their raw form are relative to each other, showing how more likely one hypothesis is compared to the other.

Thus, the final answer in the requested format would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.07 / P(E)",
  "computer science": "0.045 / P(E)"
}
```

To simplify and without the exact marginal likelihood, both values can be interpreted as being directly proportional to 0.07 and 0.045, respectively, where 0.07 indicates a higher conditional probability supporting Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to 0.045 supporting Computer Science.
