To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, the prior probability of the hypothesis, and the marginal likelihood of the evidence. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), we cannot calculate exact posterior probabilities. Instead, we can consider qualitative factors to make reasonable estimates.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's qualitatively assess the likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam has high intelligence and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with the skills needed in computer science.
   - However, there's no specific mention of an interest in technology or programming, which are key components of computer science. His interests lie more in nature, plants, animals, and puzzles.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which strongly aligns with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - He also appreciates hard work and dedication, which are important characteristics in this field.

Given this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are based on the textual information provided and a qualitative assessment. For accurate probabilities, specific numerical data about prior probabilities and likelihoods would be required.
