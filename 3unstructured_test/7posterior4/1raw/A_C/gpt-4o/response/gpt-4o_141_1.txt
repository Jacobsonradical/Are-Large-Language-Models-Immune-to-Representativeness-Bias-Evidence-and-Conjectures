To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express it in the form:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given the information provided, we do not have precise numerical values for these probabilities. However, we can make subjective estimates based on the details given in the personality sketch.

Let's consider the following subjective estimates for Adam:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, it is reasonable to assume that these traits are strongly aligned with someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assign a high value of 0.8.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, these traits can be associated with computer science. However, the direct associations with nature and animals might not be as strong. Let's assign a lower value of 0.3.

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): This is the prior probability of Adam being in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Given that he's a graduate student interested in nature and animals, letâ€™s assign a value of 0.3 (as this field might be less common).
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): This is the prior probability of Adam being in computer science. Computer science is a common graduate field, we might give it a higher prior probability of 0.5.

- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence E. We can assume that this is normalized over different fields of study.

Using Bayes' rule:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not provided with the overall probability \( P(E) \), we will consider it as a common normalizing factor. Therefore, the relative comparison between the two posterior probabilities will provide the estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.24",
  "computer science": "0.15"
}
