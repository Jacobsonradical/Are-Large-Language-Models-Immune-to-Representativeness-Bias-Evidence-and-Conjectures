To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

While we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can qualitatively estimate them based on the given personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions about graduate fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): We can assume that this field is less common compared to computer science.
- **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy fit well with this field.
- **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \): This remains a constant across all fields.

### Computer Science
- **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field in the U.S., especially among graduate students in 2021.
- **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s love for puzzles and high intelligence for understanding abstract concepts make this field plausible, though it doesn't perfectly match all of his traits like his interest in nature and animals.
- **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \): This remains a constant across all fields.

Considering the above factors, and without exact numerical data, the posterior probabilities can be estimated roughly as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality traits to the fields, with a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science because of his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
