To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science" given the personality sketch of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule. However, please note that without specific priors and likelihoods, the provided calculations will be more qualitative and comparative instead of exact probabilities. Here are the general steps for Bayesian inference:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \), which can be considered as a normalizing factor.

Since the specific priors (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) are not given, I will assign relative weights based on how well Adam's personality traits align with typical characteristics of students in each field. For simplicity, I'll assign intuitive estimates.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Adam has a deep love for nature, plants, and animals.
- He exhibits strong empathy and a warm heart, which are valuable in veterinary sciences.
- Based on these aspects, \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \) is likely high.

### Computer Science
- Adam has a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with computer science traits.
- However, the strong empathy and love for animals may be less relevant.
- So, \( P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \) is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values indicate a higher probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong alignment with traits favorable to this field. The lower yet still substantial value for computer science reflects his abstract thinking and puzzle-solving skills, although the empathy and love for animals are less directly applicable.
