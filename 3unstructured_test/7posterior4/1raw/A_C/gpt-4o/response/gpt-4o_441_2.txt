To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability we are looking for.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

While we lack specific numerical data about prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), we can use qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch (E) provided. 

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals suggest a strong alignment with this field. Thus, \(P(E|H_{\text{agri & vet}})\) should be relatively high.
- Additionally, the understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with this field.

For computer science:
- While Adamâ€™s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would favor computer science, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are less directly aligned with this field. Thus, \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) would be lower.
- Empathy and love for animals might not be as directly relevant to computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can approximate the posterior probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These values are based on reasoning that Adam's personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science, despite having some attributes such as high intelligence that could fit either field. 

Remember, these values are qualitative approximations, and actual probabilities would require more detailed quantitative data.
