To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll provide a qualitative estimation based on the personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: 
   - **Prior \(P(H)\)**: This field is less common compared to some other fields, so the prior might be lower.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood seems high.
   - **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: This includes how well Adam's personality aligns with this and other fields.

2. **Computer science**: 
   - **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Computer science is a very popular field, so the prior might be higher.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with this field, other aspects like the love for animals and nature might not align as strongly.
   - **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: Again, this includes the fit with multiple fields.

Given this qualitative approach, the posterior conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

Explanation:
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, Adam's strong attributes related to nature, animals, and empathy make this field a strong candidate, hence a higher probability.
- For **computer science**, his intelligence and problem-solving skills support this fit, but the alignment is not as strong due to his other interests and attributes, leading to a lower probability.

These values are estimates based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality with the fields described.
