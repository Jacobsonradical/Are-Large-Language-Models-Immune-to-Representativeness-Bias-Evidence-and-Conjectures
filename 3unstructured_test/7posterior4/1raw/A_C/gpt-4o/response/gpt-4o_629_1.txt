To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence assuming the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

- **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: 
  - For computer science, some aspects of the personality sketch (such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles) match well. However, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are less aligned.
  - For agricultural and veterinary science, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly aligned with this field.

- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**:
  - For computer science, it is generally one of the more common graduate fields, so its prior might be relatively high.
  - For agricultural and veterinary science, this field is less common than computer science but still notably significant.

With these qualitative considerations, it's reasonable to estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the proportions based on the alignment of the personality sketch with the fields in question. The higher value for agricultural and veterinary science corresponds to the strong match in interests and traits described in the sketch.
