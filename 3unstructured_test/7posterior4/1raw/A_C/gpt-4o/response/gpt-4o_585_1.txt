To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll first need to outline Bayes' rule formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we do not possess precise values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), as well as the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule here is applied in a more heuristic form due to the lack of numerical data. Therefore, we'll rely on qualitative reasoning.

1. **Computer Science:** 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Since Adam's traits such as high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and solving puzzles are aligned with computer science, this likelihood is relatively high.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science is a popular field among graduate students in the U.S., suggesting a moderate to high prior probability.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a warm heart are aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, making this likelihood high.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This field is less common than computer science among graduate students, suggesting a lower prior probability.

Considering these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Note that these values are qualitative estimates reflecting the alignment between Adam's personality and the typical traits found in these fields, as well as the assumed popularity of each field among graduate students.
