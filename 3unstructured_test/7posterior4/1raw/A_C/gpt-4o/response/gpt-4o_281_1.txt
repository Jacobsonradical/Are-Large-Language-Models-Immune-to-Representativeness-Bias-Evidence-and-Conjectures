To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the complete likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and the marginal probability \( P(E) \), we need to make educated estimations based on the given information about Adam's personality and interests. 

Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest some likelihood toward agricultural and veterinary science, whereas his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts may suggest an affinity for computer science. 

Let’s make some qualitative estimates:

- **Computer Science**: Adam’s intelligence and abstract reasoning can be highly relevant.
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be lower because his personality shows more empathy and interest in nature and animals, which are not typically the focus in computer science.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature align closely with this field.
  - \( P(E|H) \) is likely higher because these aspects of his personality directly relate to this field.
  - Estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \)

Assuming initial equal priors \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (this is a simplifying assumption for illustration):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
