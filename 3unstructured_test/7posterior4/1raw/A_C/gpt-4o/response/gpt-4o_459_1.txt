Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \(E\).

Given that we do not have exact numerical values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\), we can still estimate the relative values based on the information provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a genuine interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with this field.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns with skills needed for computer science.
   - However, there's less direct alignment with his strong empathy and deep love for animals.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate to high for this field.

We will assume the following relative values for simplicity, knowing that:

- \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) is quite high.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\) is moderate to high.
- \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, which we assume to be a bit lower given its less commonality relative to computer science.
- \(P(H_{\text{computer science}})\) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science, which we assume to be higher given its general popularity but lower probability due to his strong inclination towards nature and animals.

Here is an estimated comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values indicate that Adam is more likely, based on his personality sketch, to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, but there is still a notable possibility for the latter.
