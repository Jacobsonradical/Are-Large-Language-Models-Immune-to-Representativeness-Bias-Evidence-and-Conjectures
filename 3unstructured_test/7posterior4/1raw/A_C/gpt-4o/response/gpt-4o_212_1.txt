To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Since these are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions for the sake of demonstration. Note that these values are indicative and would require actual data for precise calculations.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = \sum_i P(E|H_i)P(H_i) \) over all possible fields \( H_i \).

### Assumptions:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field.
   - Given no specific data, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity. Suppose there are 10 possible fields Adam could be in, then \( P(H) = 0.1 \) for each.

2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on personality sketch relevance:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) could be high. Let's assign a value of 0.9.
   - **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is also high. Let's assign a value of 0.7.

### Calculations:
1. **Posterior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Posterior for Computer Science**:
   \[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Now, to find \( P(E) \), we sum over all possible hypotheses. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume there are 10 fields each with a prior of 0.1 and approximate the likelihoods based on how closely they match Adam's attributes.

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.9) + (0.1 \times 0.7) + \sum_{i=3}^{10} (0.1 \times \text{other likelihoods}) \]

For simplicity, let's approximate other likelihoods as an average of 0.3 (assuming they are less likely but not impossible):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \times 0.9) + (0.1 \times 0.7) + 8 \times (0.1 \times 0.3) \]
\[ = 0.09 + 0.07 + 0.24 \]
\[ = 0.40 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.09}{0.4} = 0.225 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.4} = \frac{0.07}{0.4} = 0.175 \]

Therefore:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.225,
  "computer science": 0.175
}
```

These calculations and estimates are illustrative and would ideally be based on actual statistical data for more accurate results.
