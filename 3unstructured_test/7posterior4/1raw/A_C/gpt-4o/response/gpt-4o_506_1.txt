To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since we do not have exact numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on typical scenarios and the information provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down for the given hypotheses:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AV)**

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \)**: Assume computer science is a relatively common field, say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.15 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \)**: Given Adam's love for solving puzzles and his high intelligence, there's some match, but his strong empathy, love for animals, and nature don't align as well with typical computer science traits. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H_{AV}) \)**: Less common than computer science, but not rare, say \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.10 \).
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AV}) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart align very well with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.7 \).

Now, we have:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and is the same for both hypotheses, it can be ignored for relative comparison.

Let's compute the numerator for both fields:

\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.7 \times 0.10 = 0.07 \]

Now, we can compare these products to estimate the posterior probabilities in a relative sense (assuming \( P(E) \) remains constant and normalizes these values):

### Normalizing by Total

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.07} = 0.30 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.07}{0.03 + 0.07} = 0.70 \]

Finally, the values are presented in the desired format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}
