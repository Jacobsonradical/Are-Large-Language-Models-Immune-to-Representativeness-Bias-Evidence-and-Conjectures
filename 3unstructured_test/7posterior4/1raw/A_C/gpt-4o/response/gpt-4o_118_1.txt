To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply this, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the characteristics in the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality characteristics, which can be considered as a normalizing constant.

Since we don't have actual data, we will have to make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
   - Assumption: The proportion of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science is lower compared to computer science, given general enrollment statistics in the U.S.
     - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \)
     - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.20 \)
   - These values are illustrative and based on general trends.

2. **Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, so we will assume a higher probability here.
   - For computer science, his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are a good fit, but his personality description suggests a potentially weaker alignment given the specific interest in nature and animals.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.30 \)

### Simplification:
Since we don't need the exact normalization factor \(P(E)\) for comparing the two probabilities:

\[ \text{Relative Probability for agricultural and veterinary science} = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.80 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

\[ \text{Relative Probability for computer science} = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06 \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities:

To normalize these, we calculate the sum of these relative probabilities:

\[ \text{Sum} = 0.04 + 0.06 = 0.10 \]

So, the normalized probabilities are:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.40 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.60 \]

Thus the normalized posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```

This suggests that, given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in computer science than agricultural and veterinary science, though both fields are a good fit given the characteristics provided.
