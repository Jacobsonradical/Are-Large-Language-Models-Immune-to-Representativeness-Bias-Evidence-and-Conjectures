To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in a specific field based on his personality sketch \( E \), we need to consider Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given a particular field of study, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam enrolling in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

- Adam has a strong love for nature, plants, and animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence.
- He has strong empathy and a warm heart.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

### Considering the Fields:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Typically involves abstract problem solving and high intelligence.
   - Emphasizes logical thinking and puzzle-solving skills.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Directly related to nature, plants, and animals.
   - Likely involves a strong appreciation for empathy towards animals.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are equal for all fields (\( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \)).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): While personality traits like intelligence and puzzle-solving fit, traits like strong empathy, love for nature and animals are less fitting.
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Fits very well with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can reason that:

- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is likely higher than \( P(E|H_{CS}) \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and doesn't affect the ratio in which we compare \( P(H|E) \) for CS versus AVS, the comparison hinges on \( P(E|H) \) and prior probabilities.

For simplicity, letâ€™s quantify these likelihoods without exact numbers but through relative weights based on the fitting of E to H.

### Conclusion with approximate relative values:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
