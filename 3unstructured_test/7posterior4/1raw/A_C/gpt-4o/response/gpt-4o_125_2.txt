To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule Formula**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

2. **Identify Components**:
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in the specified field.
   - \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant, the overall probability of observing \( E \).

Because we don't have precise statistics for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll make educated estimates based on the characteristics described in the personality sketch.

3. **Estimate Prior Probabilities**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(\text{AgVet}) \)): Let's say, roughly 0.05 (5%).
   - Computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): Let's say, roughly 0.2 (20%).

4. **Estimate Likelihoods**:
   Given Adam's personality (love of nature, animals, empathy, intelligence, puzzle-solving):
   - \( P(E|\text{AgVet}) \): High, maybe around 0.7, because his traits strongly align with the field.
   - \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): Moderate, maybe around 0.3, as some traits (intelligence, puzzle-solving) align, but the love of nature and animals less so.

5. **Estimate \( P(E) \)**:
   Since we are dealing with a general personality sketch that might apply to various fields, we can consider it as a normalizing constant. For our purpose, it's sufficient to recognize it normalizes the distribution.

Given these estimates:
- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{AgVet}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]
- For computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Even though \( P(E) \) is not exactly known, the ratio between these two values gives us the relative likelihood. For clarity:

\[ \text{Relative likelihood for AgVet} \approx 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \]
\[ \text{Relative likelihood for CS} \approx 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

To what these actually compute:

- Normalizing constant for \( P(E) \) can be ignored for the ratio purposes.

Final probabilities (still rough estimates):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.06} \approx 0.368
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.035 + 0.06} \approx 0.632
\]

Given rough estimates and simplifying, we summarize:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "computer science": 0.632
}
