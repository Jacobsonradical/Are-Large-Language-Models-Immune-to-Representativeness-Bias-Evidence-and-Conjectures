To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities, likelihoods, and normalizing constants. Unfortunately, specific quantitative values are not given, so we will have to make some heuristic assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Given:
- \(E\): The personality sketch of Adam.
- \(H_{\text{CS}}\): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \(H_{\text{Agri}}\): The hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in each field is equal because we don't have any other information. Thus, \(P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{Agri}}) = 0.5\).

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - The given personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals suggest that Adam is more likely to be in the agricultural and veterinary science field. We will assume a higher likelihood for this hypothesis.
   - Conversely, the traits also suggest high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which is favorable for computer science but to a lesser extent given the specific emphasis on nature and animals.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assign:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3\)
- \(P(E|H_{\text{Agri}}) = 0.7\)

3. **Normalizing Constant (P(E))**:
   - This is generally computed based on all possible hypotheses but for simplicity and due to lack of other hypotheses, let's consider it normalizing to 1 for the scope of our problem.

### Calculating Posteriors
We need to calculate:
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)}\)
- \(P(H_{\text{Agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agri}})}{P(E)}\)

Using our assumptions:
- \(P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{Agri}})P(H_{\text{Agri}})\)
- \(P(E) = (0.3 * 0.5) + (0.7 * 0.5) = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5\)

Now,
- \(P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 * 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3\)
- \(P(H_{\text{Agri}}|E) = \frac{0.7 * 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7\)

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
