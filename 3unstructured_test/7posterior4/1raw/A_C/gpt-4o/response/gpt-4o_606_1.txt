To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only provide qualitative assessments based on the description provided in the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's assess each field based on the information given:

### Computer Science
Adam is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with the skills needed for computer science. However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature and its plants suggest that his primary passion may lie outside of this field.

**Qualitative Assessment: Moderate Probability**

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Adam's deep love for animals, strong empathy, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. These personality traits suggest that he would likely be very passionate and well-suited for a career in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

**Qualitative Assessment: High Probability**

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can provide an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities.

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values should be taken as qualitative rather than precise quantitative assessments due to the lack of specific probability values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods.
