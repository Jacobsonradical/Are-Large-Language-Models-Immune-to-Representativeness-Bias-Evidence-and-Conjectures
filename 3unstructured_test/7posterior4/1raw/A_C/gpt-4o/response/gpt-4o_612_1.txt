To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field under consideration, we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

However, to use Bayes' rule effectively, we need the following information:
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

Since we do not have the exact statistical values for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative estimation based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science (CS)**: Students in this field generally work on problems related to computation, software, theory, and hardware. Although curiosity and high intelligence are relevant, empathy, love for animals, and nature are less directly related.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgVetSci)**: This field aligns closely with an interest in nature, plants, and animals. Empathy and a warm heart are highly relevant due to interactions with animals and potentially working with communities.

Now, qualitatively estimating:
- **\(P(E|H_{CS})\)**: Moderate, as curiosity and intelligence fit, but nature and animals are less central.
- **\(P(E|H_{AgVetSci})\)**: High, as most traits in the sketch are directly relevant.
- **\(P(H_{CS})\)**: Let's assume a relatively common choice among graduate fields.
- **\(P(H_{AgVetSci})\)**: Less common compared to CS, but the traits suggest a higher probability given the field.

### Estimations:
Qualitatively, it looks more likely that Adam's personality traits align more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Computer Science.

### Plugging in qualitative values:
- \(P(E|H_{CS})\) = 0.3 (less match)
- \(P(H_{CS})\) = 0.15 (prior assumption)
- \(P(E|H_{AgVetSci})\) = 0.7 (better match)
- \(P(H_{AgVetSci})\) = 0.05 (prior assumption)

Since we do not have \(P(E)\), it cancels in the ratio as we compare fields relatively:

### Result:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.12",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.35"
}
```

These values indicate a greater alignment of the personality sketch with Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science.
