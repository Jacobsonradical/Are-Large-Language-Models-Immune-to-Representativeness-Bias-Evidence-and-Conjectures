To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to utilize the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Given the limited information, we can make some reasonable assumptions about how likely the evidence fits each hypothesis. We must make subjective estimations for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{H: computer science}) \): Suppose we assume that about 20% of graduate students in the US are in computer science (this is an assumption for illustration).
   - \( P(\text{H: agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Suppose we assume that about 5% of graduate students in the US are in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{E | H: computer science}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it is less likely (but not impossible) that someone with a deep love for nature and animals would be in computer science. Let's assume a value of 0.1.
   - \( P(\text{E | H: agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he would be in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a value of 0.8.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \) can be computed as \( P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \ldots \)
   - For simplicity, let's approximate it as a normalization factor.

### Computation:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{H | E})_{\text{cs}} = \frac{P(E | \text{H}_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{H | E})_{\text{agri}} = \frac{P(E | \text{H}_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(\text{H}_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization Factor \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx \sum \big( P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \big) = (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) = 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.06 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

\[ P(\text{H | E})_{\text{cs}} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.06} = \frac{0.02}{0.06} \approx 0.333 \]

\[ P(\text{H | E})_{\text{agri}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.06} = \frac{0.04}{0.06} \approx 0.667 \]

Here are the results:
