To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to outline Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

To simplify our calculation for this specific example, let’s assume:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields are equal due to lack of prior information favoring one field over the other.
2. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields as it's a normalizing constant.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Considering these points:
- "Agricultural and veterinary science" aligns closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- "Computer science" aligns with his enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.

To quantify this subjectively (because exact figures aren't provided), we will estimate probabilities based on how well each field fits the personality sketch:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|H) \) is high because the traits closely match this field.
2. For computer science, \( P(E|H) \) is also high but slightly lower because it doesn’t directly align with his love for animals and nature but fits well with his enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.

Assuming equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the fact that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor, we can focus on \( P(E|H) \).

So, the subjective probabilities might look like this:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

These values are subjective estimates based on the provided information and may be refined with additional context or data.
