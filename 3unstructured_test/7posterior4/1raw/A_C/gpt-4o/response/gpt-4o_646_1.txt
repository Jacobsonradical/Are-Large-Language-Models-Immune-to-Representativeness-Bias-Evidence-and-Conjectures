To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule. The rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Without exact statistics or contextual probabilities (i.e., specific data on the proportion of graduate students in each field), we can't calculate precise probabilities. However, we can provide reasonable qualitative estimates based on the given sketch of Adam’s personality.

Let’s consider the nature of Adam’s personality traits and align them with each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Strength in understanding abstract concepts aligns with the analytical and logical skills needed in computer science.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, which is a good indicator of problem-solving skills important in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants aligns directly with agricultural science.
   - Deep love for animals is strongly indicative of veterinary science.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart also suggest a career working closely with living beings, which fits the veterinary field well.

Given this information, we can make qualitative estimates. For precision, if we had access to prior probabilities (e.g., overall proportions of students in each field) and normalized these estimates, we could provide more refined calculations. But for now, the qualitative estimates are as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The higher probability for "agricultural and veterinary science" reflects the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with that field.
