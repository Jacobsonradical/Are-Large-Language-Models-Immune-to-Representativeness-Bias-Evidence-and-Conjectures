To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the calculation of the exact posterior probabilities would require detailed prior probabilities (P(H)) and the likelihoods (P(E|H)) for each field, as well as the evidence probability (P(E)). Since these specific values are not provided in the problem, I will qualitatively assess the likelihood and provide approximate values based on the information in the personality sketch E.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - P(E|H) is likely high because Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals."
   - Based on Adam's characteristics, there is a strong alignment with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - P(E|H) is likely moderate because while Adam enjoys "solving puzzles" and has "high intelligence" and an aptitude for "abstract concepts," the sketch emphasizes nature, plants, and animals more than skills directly related to computer science.
   - Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication can apply to any field, so it does not significantly increase his likelihood of being in computer science over other fields.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here is an approximate representation:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
