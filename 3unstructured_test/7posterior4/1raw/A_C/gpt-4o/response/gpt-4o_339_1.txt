Sure, the calculation of the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule requires knowing specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, we can reason qualitatively based on the personality sketch given.

### Bayesian Inference
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make a qualitative assessment instead. 

### Simplified Bayesian Reasoning
- **P(E|H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality habits given that he is enrolled in each field.
  - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, it is reasonable to assume a high likelihood as Adam has a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, plants, and a compassionate disposition.
  - For **computer science**, while intelligence and abstract reasoning fit well, the details about nature, plants, and animals don't align particularly with the typical skill set or interests of this field.

- **P(H)**: This is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in each field.
  - Both fields are quite distinct and hence should be considered independently; however, given Adam's personality, agricultural and veterinary science might have a higher prior probability.

As exact figures are not given, letâ€™s assign qualitative estimates:

### Posterior Qualitative Estimates
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These values are chosen based on how well the personality sketch fits the general attributes and interests required for each field. Note that these are qualitative assessments and actual values might differ with more precise data.
