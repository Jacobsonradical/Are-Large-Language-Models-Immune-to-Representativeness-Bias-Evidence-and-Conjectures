To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a particular field before considering Adam's personality) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in each field). Since exact prior probabilities and likelihood values are not provided, I will make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in each field.

We will be using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact numerical values, we can only infer relative probabilities based on the described characteristics.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assumption: Graduate enrollment distribution is relatively uniform across fields, but might slightly favor more common fields like computer science.
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.20 \)
   
2. **Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
     - High likelihood given Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals.
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)
   
   - Computer Science:
     - Medium likelihood given Adam's high intelligence, puzzle-solving interest, and abstract thinking skills.
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.4 \)

Since \( P(E) \), the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, is the same for both hypotheses and would act as a normalizing factor, we can focus on comparing the products of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Relative posterior probabilities would be:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.20 = 0.08 \]

To express these as conditional probabilities, we normalize them:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.08} \approx 0.304 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.035 + 0.08} \approx 0.696 \]

However, these calculations should be treated with caution due to the assumptions and approximations made. Given these considerations, here is the answer format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.304,
  "computer science": 0.696
}
