To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall evidence \( P(E) \), the exact numerical values cannot be determined precisely. Instead, we can give an educated guess based on the given personality sketch.

1. **For Computer Science:**
   * Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence, a strong understanding of abstract concepts, and his enjoyment in solving puzzles align well with a computer science background. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not as typical for computer science students.
   * Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field with many graduate students, suggesting a reasonable prior probability.
   
   Therefore, while some of Adam's traits align with a computer science student, several key traits do not. This suggests a moderate but not high probability for computer science.

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   * Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals highly align with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   * Prior \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to fields like computer science, but Adam's traits closely match this field.
   
   Therefore, given the alignment of Adam's traits with this field, the probability is relatively high.

Taking these qualitative assessments into account, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70
}
```

These are estimates based on the provided information. If additional data on prior probabilities and likelihoods were available, more precise calculations could be made.
