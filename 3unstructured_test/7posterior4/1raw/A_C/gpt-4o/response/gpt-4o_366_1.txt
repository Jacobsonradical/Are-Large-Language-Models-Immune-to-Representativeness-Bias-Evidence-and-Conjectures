To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to make exact calculations for any hypothesis, we would need specific priors and likelihoods, which are typically derived from extensive data or domain-specific knowledge. Without precise numerical values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields. 

Here's a qualitative assessment of how likely Adam might be enrolled in each of the specified fields given his interests and qualities:

**Computer Science**:
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are good fits.
- Enjoyment of puzzles aligns well with problem-solving in computer science.
- Empathy and love for animals are less indicative of this field, but not exclusive.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is a strong indicator.
- Empathy and love for animals strongly favor this field.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work align with the demanding nature of agricultural sciences.

Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher degree of fit for the agricultural and veterinary sciences over computer science, given Adam's described personality traits and interests.
