To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we would ideally need specific data regarding the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the overall probability of the evidence \(P(E)\). Unfortunately, without this data, I cannot provide precise numerical values. However, I can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on the personality sketch.

The personality sketch describes Adam as someone who has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a good understanding of abstract concepts. He also values hard work and dedication.

With these considerations, let's qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities for each field given the evidence.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, combined with his love for animals, strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Additionally, his empathy and dedication are highly relevant to this field.
   - **Qualitative estimate**: High probability
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence for understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits for computer science, there are fewer explicit connections in the given personality sketch to this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Qualitative estimate**: Moderate probability

Given the qualitative nature of our assessment and the lack of precise numerical data, here is a plausible estimation based on the described traits:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.40
}
```

Note that these values are illustrative and based on qualitative reasoning. Accurate computation would require more detailed information about prior probabilities and likelihoods.
