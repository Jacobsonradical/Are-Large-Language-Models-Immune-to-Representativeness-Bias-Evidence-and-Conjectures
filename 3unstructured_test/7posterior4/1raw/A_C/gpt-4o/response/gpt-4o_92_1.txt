To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities. Thus, we need to estimate them based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) (the probability of the personality sketch \( E \)) remains the same across both fields.

Using the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate to Low, considering the general popularity of this field among graduate students.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, since Computer Science is a very popular and broad field among graduate students.

Putting these qualitative assessments into a more concrete form:
- Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.1 (10%).
- Let's assume the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.8 (80%).

\[ P(H = \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.08 / P(E) \]


- Let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for Computer Science is 0.3 (30%).
- Let's assume the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science is 0.6 (60%).

\[ P(H = \text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx 0.18 / P(E) \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, the ratio without normalization would roughly tell us that Computer Science is more likely than Agricultural and Veterinary Science given the personality sketch.
 
Based on approximate qualitative measures:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3",
  "computer science": "0.7"
}
```

Note that these numbers are qualitative assessments rather than precise probabilities due to lack of exact numerical data.
