To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to compute exact numerical values, we would typically need more specific data on base rates (prior probabilities \( P(H) \)), the likelihood of observing the evidence given each hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). In this case, we don't have specific numerical values for these, so we will make educated estimates based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \):
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- Has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align more naturally with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, due to his curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. There are some traits (intelligence and puzzle-solving ability) that could also align with computer science, but less strongly compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

With these considerations, a reasonable estimation might be as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates indicate that, based on Adam's personality traits, it is more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science, but it still leaves open a significant probability that he could be in computer science, just less likely.
