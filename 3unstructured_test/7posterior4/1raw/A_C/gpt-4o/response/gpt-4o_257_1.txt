To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formal approach. However, given the nature of the problem and limited specific prior probabilities and likelihood data, we will have to make reasonable assumptions based on the sketch.

### Applying Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence (marginal likelihood).

Although we don't have precise numerical values for these probabilities, we can consider the qualitative aspects of Adam's personality sketch to make educated guesses about the likelihoods:

- Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, plus his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he has traits that align well with both fields. 
- His love for animals and nature gives a strong indication toward agricultural and veterinary science.
- His intelligence, curiosity, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align him well with the qualities desired in computer science.

### Assumptions:
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) is equally likely for both fields due to lack of prior data.
- Given that E suggests a strong inclination towards nature and animals, we might assume \( P(E|H)\) is higher for agricultural and veterinary science.

Now, estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the idea that Adam is more likely associated with agricultural and veterinary science due to stronger indicators in his personality sketch towards this field.
