To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) before seeing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Let's make some simplifying assumptions to proceed with the calculations.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume all graduate fields have an equal prior probability for simplicity, due to lack of specific data. Although in practice, the specific university or context could influence these priors.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   - Based on the personality sketch \( E \), make an educated guess about how well the evidence fits each field.

### Estimations:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
    - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: High
    - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals: Very High
    - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Moderate (important, but not as distinguishing as the emotional traits)
  - Based on this, we might assign a likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science as 0.9.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
    - Enjoys solving puzzles: High
    - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Very High
    - Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals: Low (less relevant)
  - Based on this, we might assign a likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science as 0.5.

### Calculations:
To simplify, consider:
- \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, so it doesn't affect the relative probability \( \frac{P(H|E_1)}{P(H|E_2)} \).

Given equal priors, we can focus on the likelihoods alone for a simplified comparison.

Thus:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_1|E) & \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) \approx 0.9 \text{ (for agricultural and veterinary science)}, \\
P(H_2|E) & \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \approx 0.5 \text{ (for computer science)}. \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Since the absolute values of \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \) are equal across all fields, the posterior probabilities can be directly compared via the likelihood.

### Final Result:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9, \\
  "computer science": 0.5
}
\]

Thus, given the personality sketch of Adam, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, based on the Bayesian estimation applied with our assumptions.
