To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

While we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can make some qualitative assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **For agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, \( P(E|H) \) would be relatively high.
   - Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science might be less common than in fields like computer science, which affects \( P(H) \).

2. **For computer science:**
   - Adam's interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, making \( P(E|H) \) high for this field as well.
   - Computer science is a very common field of study for graduate students, impacting \( P(H) \).

Since we don't have specific values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), let's consider only \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is higher than for computer science due to Adam's explicit interest in nature and animals.
- \( P(H) \) is higher for computer science purely based on the prevalence of the field among graduate students.

By balancing these two considerations qualitatively without exact numerical values, we can estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

This indicates that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more probable that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, but there is still a significant likelihood for computer science, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.
