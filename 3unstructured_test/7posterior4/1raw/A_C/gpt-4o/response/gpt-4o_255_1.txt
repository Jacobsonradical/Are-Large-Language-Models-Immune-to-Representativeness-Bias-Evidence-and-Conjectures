To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (field of study) given the evidence (personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Assumptions to make the problem computable:
1. We assume \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses since it will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.
2. We use qualitative reasoning to estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality traits match with typical students in each field.

Now, focusing on the fields provided:

1. **Computer Science**
   - Traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are quite relevant. However, curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy might be less directly relevant.
   - So, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) could be considered moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - The subject's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - As a result, \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \) would be considered high.

Assuming equal priors (\( P(H) \)) for simplicity:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AgVet}) \)

Then, the posterior probabilities are proportional to the likelihoods:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \]

This yields:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This reflects that based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" than in "computer science" as his field of study, based on the qualitative alignment with his traits.
