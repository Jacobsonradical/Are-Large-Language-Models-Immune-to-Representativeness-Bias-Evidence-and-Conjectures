To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we may not have precise numerical values for all these probabilities. Therefore, let's approach this problem qualitatively based on the given personality sketch of Adam, while assuming that some values can be intuitively estimated.

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **computer science**, given Adam's high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, \( P(E|H) \) is likely to be moderately high.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, considering Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, \( P(E|H) \) is also likely to be high.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - We need to assess how common it is for graduate students to enroll in these fields. While exact statistics aren't provided, computer science is a popular field in the U.S. It is likely that the prior probability for computer science is higher than agricultural and veterinary science.
   
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)** should be similar for both fields as it only depends on the attributes of Adam, which remain constant.

Given the qualitative analysis, let's assign approximate values based on the provided information.

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

These values reflect the probabilities conditioned on the given personality sketch but can be adjusted with more precise data if available.
