To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in a particular field \( H \).
2. The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
3. The marginal probability of the personality sketch \( E \), which can be complex to compute directly and often requires normalization over all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since detailed numeric values for each probability term are not provided, we will make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch.

### Reasoned Likelihood Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy are highly aligned with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) is high.
   
2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggest he could be well-suited for this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{computer}) \) is moderate to high.

### Reasoned Prior Estimations:
Assuming no other information specifically biases the prior for one field over another, we'll use assumed baseline priors:
   - \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) and \( P(H_{computer}) \) are assumed equal for simplicity.

### Posterior Probability Estimates:
Given the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality with the fields, we can make relative probability estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

**Note**: These values are reasoned based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality to each field rather than precise numerical calculations. In a real scenario, these probabilities could be refined with more specific data regarding the likeliness and prior probabilities.
