To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in specific fields, we will leverage Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we will need to estimate these probabilistically based on the information provided in the personality sketch \( E \). Let's make some qualitative assessments for these probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
    - For **computer science**, let's assume it's a common graduate field, thus \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderately high.
    - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, it's a more niche field compared to computer science, but given Adam's interests, \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) can be considered reasonably high too.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
    - For **computer science**, given Adam's intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is fairly high because these attributes are beneficial in this field.
    - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, given Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is probably very high.

3. **Marginal Probability (P(E))**:
    - The marginal probability \( P(E) \) can be considered the same for both fields when making qualitative comparisons, thus, it cancels out in the ratio.

Based on these assumptions, let's provide qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities.

```python
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam has a reasonable likelihood of being in computer science, his personality sketch shows a stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
