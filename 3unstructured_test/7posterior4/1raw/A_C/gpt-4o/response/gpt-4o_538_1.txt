To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being in a certain field before considering the given evidence.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The probability of Adam being in a particular field given the evidence.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:

\[
P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)
\]

Given that we do not have exact prior probabilities or precise likelihood values, we will make educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch. 

**Assumptions**:
1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are assumed to be roughly equal for all fields because we don't have specific data suggesting otherwise.
2. The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) will be assessed based on how well the fields align with Adamâ€™s personality sketch.

Let's make educated assumptions:

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
  Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be fairly uniform across different fields, for simplicity. 

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, there is a high likelihood of him being in this field.
  - For **computer science**: His enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with this field.

Given these points, though qualitative, let's assign hypothetical values to likelihoods and prior probabilities:
- **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \)  (more likely due to nature and animals)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)

- **computer science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \)  (likeliness based on intelligence and problem-solving)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

- **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
  \[
  P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.4 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6
  \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} \approx 0.67 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E \text{ for computer science}) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} \approx 0.33 
\]

Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```

These values are reliant on our hypothetical priors and likelihoods which were based on the qualitative assessment of the personality sketch.
