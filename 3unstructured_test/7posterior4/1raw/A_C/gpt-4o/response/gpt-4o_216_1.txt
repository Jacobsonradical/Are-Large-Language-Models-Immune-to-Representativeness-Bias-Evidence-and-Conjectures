To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some more specific information like prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, we can make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can qualitatively assess:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, this field seems quite consistent with his personality sketch.

- **Computer Science:** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which fits well with computer science. However, his pronounced interest in nature and animals makes this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch, but also recognize that his puzzle-solving and intelligence could fit well with computer science to a lesser extent.
