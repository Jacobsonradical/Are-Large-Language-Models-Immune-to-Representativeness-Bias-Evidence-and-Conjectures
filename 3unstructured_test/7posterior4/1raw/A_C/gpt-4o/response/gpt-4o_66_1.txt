To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical probabilities for each component (like \( P(E|H) \)), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the traits described in Adam's personality sketch. For the sake of this exercise, we will make educated estimations.

Given Adam's interests and traits, it is more likely that he would be involved in Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Computer Science. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**: While Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, computer science does not particularly align with his deep love for nature, plants, and animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.

Given this qualitative assessment:

- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality if he is in Computer Science) is lower compared to \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) (Probability of observing Adam's personality if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science). 
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) (Prior probability of being in Computer Science) might be significant given the popularity of the field, but \( P(H_{avs}) \) (Prior probability of being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science) is more aligned given Adam's personality.

For these reasons, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality traits to the described fields, with a higher probability assigned to Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to a stronger alignment with his interests and personality.
