To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to find:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits given the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality traits (the evidence).

However, we don't have numerical values for these probabilities directly. Instead, we will need to make reasonable estimates based on the description of Adam's personality and typical graduate student distributions.

Using the information given:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \): We'll assume a moderately high prior probability since computer science is a popular graduate field. Let's estimate \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) \): The traits described are somewhat consistent with computer science students (high intelligence, puzzle solving, understanding abstract concepts), but not perfect. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(\text{AgVet}) \): We'll assume a lower prior probability for this field being less common among graduate students. Let's estimate \( P(\text{AgVet}) = 0.05 \).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{AgVet}) \): The traits fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science students (deep love for animals, appreciation for dedication, curiosity about nature). Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{AgVet}) = 0.8 \).

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities. Note that \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and acts as a normalizing constant.

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1
\]
\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) \propto P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and we are not normalizing to sum to 1:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.1
\]

\[
P(\text{AgVet}|E) \approx 0.04
\]

Given these estimates, the posterior probabilities (relative but not normalized) are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

Please note these values are illustrative and based on rough estimates. The actual values would depend on more precise data regarding graduate student distributions and the fit of Adam's personality traits to these fields.
