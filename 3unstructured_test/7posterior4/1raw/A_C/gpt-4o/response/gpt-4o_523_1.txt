To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions, as exact data is not provided. 

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - Assume prior probabilities are uniform for simplicity, given that the specific distribution of students across fields is not provided.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Assessing the likelihood based on Adamâ€™s personality traits fitting particular fields.

Given that Adam has a love for animals and nature, we can assume a higher likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, however, do benefit him in both fields.

### Likelihood Estimations:

- **Computer Science \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):**
  - Moderate likelihood due to problem-solving skills and intelligence: let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \):**
  - High likelihood due to his love for nature, plants, and animals: let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \).

### Posterior Calculation:

We are assuming uniform priors, thus \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \). Bayes' rule simplifies to comparing the likelihoods directly. Given our rough estimations:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)

### Normalizing:

- Let us assume the combined likelihood \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) for normalization.

Thus,

\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.8 = 1.2 \]

Finally,

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.4}{1.2} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) = \frac{0.8}{1.2} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667
}
