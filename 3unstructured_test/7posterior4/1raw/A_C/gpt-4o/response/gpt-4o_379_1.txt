To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Without specific numerical values, we'll provide a qualitative estimate based on Adam's personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with these fields.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's likely that he might be enrolled in a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also indicate he might be a candidate for computer science, but the concrete details about his affinity for nature and animals suggest a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's denote:
- \( H_A \) as the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_C \) as the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided by Adam's personality sketch.

For simplicity, we'll assign subjective probabilities reflecting these qualitative considerations:

1. \( P(H_A) \): The prior probability Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science. Given his characteristics, let's assume a moderately high prior.
2. \( P(H_C) \): The prior probability Adam is studying computer science. Given his problem-solving skills and intelligence, let's assume a lower prior than \( P(H_A) \).

Suppose:
- The likelihood \( P(E|H_A) \) is high because his traits align well with this field.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H_C) \) is moderate because some traits fit, but there isn't a strong emphasis on nature or animals in computer science.

We can estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given sketch while acknowledging a significant, but lower, possibility he could be in computer science due to his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities.
