To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we cannot compute exact numerical values. Instead, we will qualitatively assess the relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch. Here is a qualitative assessment:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and various plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with someone pursuing agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Computer Science:** While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and abstract reasoning skills, which are beneficial in computer science, these traits are more universally applicable and do not specifically point towards computer science as strongly as they do towards agricultural and veterinary science given the rest of his profile.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the relative probabilities can be estimated as follows (these are subjective and for illustrative purposes):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch. The values do not sum to 1 because they reflect proportional likelihoods rather than exclusive probabilities across all possible fields.
