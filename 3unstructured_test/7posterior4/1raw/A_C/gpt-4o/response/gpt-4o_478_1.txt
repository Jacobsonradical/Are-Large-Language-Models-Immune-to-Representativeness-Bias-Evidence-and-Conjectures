To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields (agricultural and veterinary science, computer science), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

We’ll make some assumptions to approximate these probabilities. Let's assume:

1. \( P(H) \) is the same across all fields initially, meaning Adam could be equally likely to be enrolled in any graduate field before considering the personality sketch \( E \).
2. \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses since it normalizes the probabilities and is therefore consistent across different hypotheses.

### Assumptions on likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - High likelihood since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and shows strong empathy and warmth.
   - Hence, let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Moderate likelihood since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, making him well-suited for computer science.
   - Hence, let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \).

Given these assumptions and simplifying to equal priors:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' rule,

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) cancels out when comparing the two fields:

Normalizing for comparison:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.35 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.25 \]

Thus, we get the answers:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values are not normalized but indicate the relative likelihoods under our assumptions. To get a true probabilistic answer, we would have to normalize these so their sum is considered relative to all possible graduate fields, which we omit for simplicity as instructed.
