To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

we need to have prior probability distributions \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), as well as the overall evidence \( P(E) \). However, without specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given information about Adam.

Let's break down the given personality sketch and evaluate it qualitatively for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and warm-hearted nature.
   - These traits align well with someone who might be enrolled in an agricultural and veterinary science program.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - He has a high intelligence which could be a fit for computer science, as the field requires strong problem-solving skills and an understanding of abstract concepts.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can posit the following likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (denoted \( H_{\text{ag} \& \text{vet}} \))**:
   - \( P(E | H_{\text{ag} \& \text{vet}}) \) would be high due to Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature.

2. **Computer Science (denoted \( H_{\text{cs}} \))**:
   - \( P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \) would be moderate due to Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence.

However, since we don't have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can qualitatively provide a range between 0 and 1 based on the weight of the qualitative detections previously discussed:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Please note that these values are approximations based on qualitative reasoning and should be refined with actual data for precise calculations.
