To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we lack specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can estimate relative probabilities based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete data, we'll need to make some well-informed assumptions based on the provided personality traits and the typical characteristics of students in the mentioned fields.

Let's make reasonable assumptions:
1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):** 
   - Assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity: \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Computer Science: Fields like computer science value high intelligence and an appreciation for abstract concepts, which fit Adam. However, the personality sketch places strong emphasis on nature, animals, and empathyâ€”characteristics not typically associated with a strong match for computer science.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The strong connection to nature, plants, animals, and empathy align well with this field.

With these considerations, we can make some estimative calculations:

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \): Because empathy, nature, and animals are less central to computer science.
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \): Because Adam's traits strongly align with this field.

Since \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields and \( P(E) \) remains constant for the computations:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \]

Normalizing these values (though it's not requested, it helps to see the relative comparison):
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note that these values are estimations based on assumptions made from the personality sketch and typical characteristics of the fields.
