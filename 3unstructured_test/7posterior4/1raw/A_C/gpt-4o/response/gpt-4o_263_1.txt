To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

In the absence of specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we will make reasonable assumptions based on commonly observed trends or knowledge of the fields.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science Hypothesis (\( H_{agri} \)):**
    - \( P(H_{agri}) \): Assume this probability is relatively low because fewer students enroll in this specialized field.
    - \( P(E|H_{agri}) \): High, given the strong alignment with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work.

2. **Computer Science Hypothesis (\( H_{cs} \)):**
    - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Higher than agricultural and veterinary science due to the popularity and general demand for this field.
    - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Moderate, as his problem-solving skills and intelligence align but with less emphasis on nature, animals, or empathy.

Based on these assumptions, we qualitatively approximate the posterior probabilities.

These values are subjective estimates. Empirical data or further specific details are needed for exact computations.
