To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have a few pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis, \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \).
3. The overall probability of the evidence, \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are not given the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we can only make a qualitative estimate based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

The sketch indicates that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits suggest a closer alignment with fields related to nature and animals.

Given these descriptions, we qualitatively estimate the probabilities as follows:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's interests strongly align with the nature-related focus of this field.
- **P(H)**: We assume this field has a moderate student enrollment in graduate programs.
- **P(E)**: As Adam's personality traits strongly fit this field, we can expect a higher posterior probability.

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H)**: While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills might align with computer science, his other traits (love for nature and animals, empathy) are less predictive of this field.
- **P(H)**: This field typically has high enrollment in graduate programs.
- **P(E)**: Given the mismatch of some crucial traits, the posterior probability might be lower.

Hence, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities, in qualitative terms, would be:

\[ \begin{align*}
\text{P(computer science|E)} & = 0.2 \\
\text{P(agricultural and veterinary science|E)} & = 0.8
\end{align*} \]

Adjusting for a final representation, we have:

```
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```
