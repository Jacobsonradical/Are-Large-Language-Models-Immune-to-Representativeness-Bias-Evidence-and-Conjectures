Computing the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule requires knowledge of several probabilities:

1. **P(H|E)**: The probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
3. **P(H)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis H.
4. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence E.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, any quantification here would be an estimate based on plausible assumptions derived from the described traits.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - **P(E|H)**: Intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with a profile of a computer science student, though empathy and a love for animals are less typical.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a common and popular graduate field, thus the prior probability might be relatively high.
   - **P(E)**: Given Adam's traits, they are less aligned with typical characteristics expected in computer science students, which might slightly lower this probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: A strong understanding of nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **P(H)**: This field is less common than computer science but fits his profile very well.
   - **P(E)**: Adam's complete personality sketch is highly indicative of someone in this field, increasing this probability.

Given these considerations, I estimate:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are educated estimates based on the given personality sketch and general assumptions about the fields. For precise probabilities, more specific data would be required about the distribution and characteristics of students in these fields relative to Adam's traits.
