Using Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field requires some prior knowledge or assumptions about the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in each graduate field, as well as the prior probability of being enrolled in each field. Since we lack specific data, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of evidence \(E\).

Let's break it down for each field based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is in agricultural and veterinary science should be fairly high given his love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower compared to more common fields like computer science among graduate students.
   - **P(E)**: The overall probability of having these characteristics should be the same across fields.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of Adam having these traits if he is in computer science could be reasonable due to his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being in computer science tends to be higher given the large number of students in this field.
   - **P(E)**: Same as above.

Without specific numbers, we will qualitatively assess and assume some reasonable values:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \(P(E|H)\) might be about 0.8 (high due to his interests and traits).
- \(P(H)\) might be about 0.1 (lower due to fewer students in this field).

For **Computer Science**:
- \(P(E|H)\) might be about 0.5 (reasonable due to his skills and interests).
- \(P(H)\) might be about 0.3 (higher due to the popularity of the field).

Let's normalize using these qualitative assessments and provide a relative comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.1 / P(E),
  "computer science": 0.5 * 0.3 / P(E)
}

Since \(P(E)\) is common and will normalize the results, we can provide relative values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These are qualitative approximations. In practice, precise values would require actual data on the distribution and likelihood of traits given different fields.
