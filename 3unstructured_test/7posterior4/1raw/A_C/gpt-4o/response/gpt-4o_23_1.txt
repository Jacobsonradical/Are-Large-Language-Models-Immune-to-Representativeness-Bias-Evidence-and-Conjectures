To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence, which can be derived from the law of total probability.

Since only limited information is provided and actual prior probabilities are not given, we need to make educated guesses based on typical distributions of graduate study fields and the fit of Adam's personality sketch to each field.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{\text{CS}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{AgVet}} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science.

We need to estimate:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)

### 1. Priors \( P(H) \)

Assume percentages of graduate students in the U.S. in various fields:
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.15 \) (15% of graduate students are in computer science)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.05 \) (5% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
  
### 2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)

From the personality sketch:
- Nature and plants appreciation: More aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence: Consistent with computer science, but not exclusive.
- Strong empathy and animals love: More aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Abstract concepts: Consistent with both, but computer science frequently deals with abstract concepts.

Given these observations, we consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.7 \)

### 3. Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)

Calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.15 + 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 + 0.035 = 0.08 \]

### 4. Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.08} = \frac{0.045}{0.08} = 0.5625 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.08} = \frac{0.035}{0.08} = 0.4375 \]
