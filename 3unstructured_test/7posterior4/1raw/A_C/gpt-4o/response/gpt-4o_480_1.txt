To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \): the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a specific field before considering Adam's personality sketch.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, considering all possible fields he could be enrolled in.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack specific data for prior probabilities and exact likelihoods, we will make reasonable, qualitative estimates based on Adam's personality traits and the nature of the fields in question.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior** \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. Let's assume it is \( p_1 \).
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits (love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, empathy) suggest a high likelihood for this field. Let's assume it is \( l_1 \).
   - **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): Estimated by considering all possible fields and their likelihoods.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior** \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field. Let's assume it is \( p_2 \).
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits (high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts) suggest a moderate likelihood for this field, but his empathy and love for animals are less typical for a computer science student. Let's assume it is \( l_2 \).
   - **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): Same as above.

Given that we don't have precise numerical values, we will estimate:
- \( p_1 \approx 0.1 \) (10%)
- \( l_1 \approx 0.8 \) (high)
- \( p_2 \approx 0.2 \) (20%)
- \( l_2 \approx 0.4 \) (moderate)

For simplicity, we consider the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) across these two fields only for normalization.

Using these estimates:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{AgriVetSci}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{CompSci}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.4 \cdot 0.2} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.16} = 0.5 \]

Thus, based on these qualitative estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.5
}

Note that these are illustrative approximations and real probabilities would require empirical data.
