To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in a specified field, \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability of the field \( P(H) \), and the evidence or normalization factor \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without actual numerical data for these probabilities, we have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch provided.

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- **Computer Science**:
  1. Curiosity about nature: Medium relevance.
  2. Enjoys solving puzzles: High relevance (common in computer science).
  3. Warm heart and empathy: Low to medium relevance.
  4. Deep love for animals: Low relevance.
  5. High intelligence, abstract concepts: High relevance.
  6. Appreciation for hard work: High relevance.

  Overall, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) has elements that align strongly with attributes common in computer science fields, like problem-solving and intelligence.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  1. Curiosity about nature: High relevance.
  2. Enjoys solving puzzles: Medium relevance.
  3. Warm heart and empathy: High relevance (veterinary science especially).
  4. Deep love for animals: Very high relevance.
  5. High intelligence, abstract concepts: Medium to high relevance.
  6. Appreciation for hard work: High relevance.

  Overall, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) aligns even more strongly here, particularly given the emphasis on nature and animals.

### Priors \( P(H) \):
Without specific numerical data, we assume equal priors for simplicity or based on general enrollment rates among graduate programs. This assumption might not be accurate, but helps in absence of data.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \]

### Evidence \( P(E) \):
This is the total probability of the evidence, summing over all possible fields. This acts as a normalization constant.

Given the qualitative match, we can propose the following approximations:

- For **Computer Science**: Since there is relevant overlap but not as strong as agricultural and veterinary science, we could roughly estimate:
  
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given the stronger alignment with the personality traits, we can estimate:

  \[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx 0.6 \]

These estimations are based on the qualitative fit of the personality traits to the respective fields.

Here's the formatted answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

Note that these estimates are qualitative and should be refined with actual probabilistic data for more precise calculations.
