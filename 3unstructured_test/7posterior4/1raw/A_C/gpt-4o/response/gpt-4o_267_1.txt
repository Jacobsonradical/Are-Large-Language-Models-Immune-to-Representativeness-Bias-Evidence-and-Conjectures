To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihood values, we will make qualitative inferences based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the detailed priors ( \( P(H) \) ) and likelihoods ( \( P(E|H) \) ) from direct data sources, we'll base our inference on qualitative judgment:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and love for animals, suggests a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
2. While Adam is described as having high intelligence and the capability to understand abstract concepts (which could align with computer science), the strong connection to nature hints more towards agricultural and veterinary sciences.
3. Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields, although it's particularly pertinent in the context of scientific research and agricultural sciences due to the nature of work in these fields.

Given this qualitative information, we can make an educated guess about the relative probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This reflects our qualitative judgment that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences than in computer science based on the description of his personality sketch.
