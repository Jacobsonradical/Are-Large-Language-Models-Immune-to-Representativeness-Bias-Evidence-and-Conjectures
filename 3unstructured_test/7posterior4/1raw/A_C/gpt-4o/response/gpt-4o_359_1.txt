To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for P(E|H), P(H), and P(E), we can't compute exact probabilities. Instead, we can make a qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch (E) and typical characteristics associated with the given fields (H).

1. **Computer Science**: While computer scientists often deal with abstract concepts and puzzles, the personality sketch of Adam emphasizes his deep love for nature, plants, and animals. This passion is less common in computer science fields.
   - P(E|H_computer science) = Moderate
   - P(H_computer science) = Moderate to high (due to the large number of students in this field)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also fit well within the agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science) = High
   - P(H_agricultural and veterinary science) = Lower than computer science due to fewer students, but more aligned with his interests

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can infer that the posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary science should be higher than for computer science. While exact values can't be determined here, we can provide estimated relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that it is more likely Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
