To compute the posterior probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), using Bayes' rule, we need to start with the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.

1. **Computer Science (CS) Hypothesis:**
   - \( H_{CS} \) = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Without any specific data, let's assume it’s the general likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in Computer Science programs. In the U.S., given the popularity of Computer Science, we might assign a reasonably high prior probability, say \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood that a Computer Science student would have Adam's personality traits. Given his qualities like high intelligence and problem-solving skills, this likelihood might be moderate. However, the focus on nature, empathy, and animals is less common for CS students. Let’s assign \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of meeting someone with Adam's traits is constant across all hypotheses and does not need to be calculated explicitly for a comparative purpose.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) Hypothesis:**
   - \( H_{AVS} \) = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume the prior probability based on the number of students enrolled in AVS fields. This field is less popular than CS, so let’s assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood that an AVS student would exhibit Adam's personality traits is very high, considering his love for nature, empathy, and animals. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E) \): Same as above, does not need explicit calculation for comparison.

Now, applying Bayes' rule for our specific fields:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx 0.06 / P(E) \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx 0.08 / P(E) \]

To get the relative posterior probabilities (since \( P(E) \) is constant across both and we’re considering relative comparison):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.06 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.08 \]

Therefore, our posterior probabilities would look like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
