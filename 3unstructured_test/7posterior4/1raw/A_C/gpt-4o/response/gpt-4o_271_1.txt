To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, you need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in each field before observing the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch under all possible fields.

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make some educated assumptions:
- Since Adam has characteristics strongly indicative of both agricultural and veterinary science (due to his love for nature, plants, and animals) and computer science (due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts), we'll assume higher prior probabilities for these fields compared to some others.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.7 \) (High likelihood given his love for nature, plants, and animals)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \) (Moderate likelihood given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills)
- \( P(E) \) will be normalized such that we only calculate the probability relevant to the given fields

Calculation:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Normalize \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + \text{other fields} \]
For simplicity, assume the normalization constant \( P(E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science and computer science fields only:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.14 + 0.10 = 0.24 \]

Therefore:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.24} \approx 0.583 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.10}{0.24} \approx 0.417 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.583,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
