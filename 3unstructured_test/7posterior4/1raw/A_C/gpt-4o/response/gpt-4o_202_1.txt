To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Here:
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., Adam being enrolled in a specific field).
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
   - \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \), which is the same for all hypotheses we are comparing.

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses, we can simplify the computation by focusing on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis. We'll then compare the relative values to infer plausibility.

### Step-by-Step Estimation:

#### 1. Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)
The distribution of graduate students across fields in the U.S is needed for precise priors, but generally, let's assume as follows based on common enrollment data:
- Computer Science: \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.05 \)

These prior probabilities are rough estimates; they can be adjusted based on more specific data.

#### 2. Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)
- For **Computer Science**:
  - Traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are typical.
  - Lesser emphasis would be on traits like love for nature and animals.
  - **Estimate**: \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \) (Curiosity for puzzles and high intelligence are supportive, but nature/animals and empathy less so).

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals fit closely.
  - Strong understanding and empathy are important here.
  - **Estimate**: \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.8 \) (Almost all traits align perfectly with this field).

#### 3. Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)
We combine prior probabilities and likelihoods:

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
  \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04
  \]

Note that the absolute values aren't as meaningful as the relative comparison.

### Conclusion:
Given the estimates and the evidence, the proportional calculation leads us to favor **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** slightly more, given the alignment with traits. Still, both hypotheses aren't definitively proving one over another without deeper data:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

Feel free to adjust the prior probabilities and likelihood estimates further for a more precise answer based on detailed data.
