To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd need to know several pieces of information, namely the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Since we don't have real data, we can only make estimations based on the given personality sketch and some general assumptions.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)  P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the purposes of this exercise, we can make educated guesses regarding the probabilities. Let's proceed with qualitative reasoning to fill in some estimated values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, let's assume the prior is reasonably high. We'll estimate \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \) = 0.2 (20%).
   - **Computer Science**: Since he enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, we can estimate this lower. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}})**: Because of Adam's affinity for nature, animals, and empathy, we might set this high. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \) = 0.8.
   - **P(E|H_{\text{CS}})**: Given that puzzle solving and intelligence are relevant but empathy and love for plants/animals are less directly related, we might set this lower. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.4.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - The marginal probability \( P(E) \) can be determined by weighing the likelihoods by their priors, across all hypotheses. Here, we will only consider the two fields mentioned for simplicity:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.4 \cdot 0.1) = 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.2 \]

4. **Posterior Conditional Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri\_vet}})  P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = \frac{0.16}{0.2} = 0.8 \]

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}})  P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Hence, the assumed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```
