To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided in the question, so we must make educated guesses based on typical assumptions.

Let's outline our assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field can be somewhat uniformly distributed among common graduate fields, but with a slight tilt towards fields that are more common or popular.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Let's evaluate how likely the personality traits described fit into each field.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- A love for animals.
- Empathy and a warm heart.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work.

Now let's incorporate these assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Most students in this field typically have a strong abstract thinking ability, high intelligence, and an inclination towards problem-solving, which aligns with some parts of Adam's personality sketch.
   - However, the love for nature, plants, and animals do not align strongly with computer science.

\( P(E|H_{CS}) \) could be considered moderate for the high intelligence and problem-solving traits.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field directly aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and strong empathy.
   - This makes \( P(E|H_{AV}) \) quite high because these traits are a good fit for agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Let's approximate our values based on the description:
- Assuming \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) and \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.1 \) based on the popularity of computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- Likelihood approximation \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \), and \( P(E|H_{AV}) =  0.7 \).

Since we don't compute the exact normalizing constant \( P(E) \), our values might not add up to 1 but will give a relative idea of the probabilities:

\[
P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} = \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
\]

Hence, we can conclude the relative strengths:
{
  "computer science": "0.46",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.54"
}

This gives an indication that Adam is slightly more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch as compared to computer science.
