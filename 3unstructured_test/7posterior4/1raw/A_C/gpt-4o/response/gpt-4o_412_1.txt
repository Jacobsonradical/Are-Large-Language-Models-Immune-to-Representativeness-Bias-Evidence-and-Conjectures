To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihoods of the personality traits given that he is in each field. Given we do not have exact probabilities, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Assumptions:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are non-informative (e.g., set them equally), as we have no specific prior data.
2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are estimated based on how fitting the personality traits are for each field.
3. \( P(E) \) cancels out in the comparisons since it is common across all hypotheses.

Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we can estimate:

- For Computer Science:
  - Curiosity about nature does not specifically align with computer science.
  - Solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
  - Empathy and strong love for animals are not particularly indicative of computer science.
  - Moderate likelihood due to a mixed fit: assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \).

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - Curiosity about nature and plants is a strong fit.
  - Solving puzzles could correlate with problem-solving in agricultural sciences.
  - Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals are very strong indicators of veterinary science.
  - High likelihood due to good alignment: assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.7 \).

Since we started with non-informative priors, let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule conceptually without specific marginal probabilities \( (P(E)) \):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.2
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35
\]

Since these do not need to sum to 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
