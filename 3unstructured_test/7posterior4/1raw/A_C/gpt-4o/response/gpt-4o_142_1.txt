To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

Given we don't have specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll make educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and common knowledge about the fields mentioned:

### Computer Science

1. **Empathy and love for animals**:
   - Not particularly aligned with computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively low.
   
2. **Interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence**:
   - Aligned with computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.

3. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{CS}) \)**:
   - Many graduate students choose computer science in the U.S.
   - Moderate to high.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Empathy, love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants**:
   - Strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \) is very high.

2. **Solving puzzles and high intelligence**:
   - Applicable but not as prominently as with computer science.
   - Moderate to high.

3. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AgVet}) \)**:
   - Less common than computer science, but still significant.
   - Moderate.

Considering these aspects, let's provide a rough guess for the probabilities:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet})}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) remains the same for both \( H_{CS} \) and \( H_{AgVet} \), we'll focus on the numerator's relative values to estimate the posterior probabilities. Here are the rough posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These estimates are based on the prominence of interest in nature, empathy for animals, and the typical alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences over computer science.
