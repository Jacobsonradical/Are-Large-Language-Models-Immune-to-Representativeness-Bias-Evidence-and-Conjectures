To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis (field of study). Typically, this would require specific data about prior probabilities and likelihoods, which we don't have directly. However, we can reason qualitatively based on the personality sketch and make reasonable estimates.

Let's break this down:

1. **Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

2. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - In the absence of specific data, the priors can be approximated by considering the popularity of graduate fields. Generally, computer science is quite popular, but this is less crucial than the likelihood given the personality sketch.

3. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For computer science: Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align with computer science, but his deep love for animals and nature is less typical.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals fit very well with this field.

Given these considerations, let's make reasonable estimates:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3, \quad P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.7
\]

Assuming priors:
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6, \quad P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}) = 0.4
\]

Calculating the evidence \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.3 \cdot 0.6 + 0.7 \cdot 0.4 = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46
\]

Now, we use Bayesâ€™ Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.6}{0.46} = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.391
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.46} = \frac{0.28}{0.46} \approx 0.609
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.391,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.609
}
```

These numbers reflect the qualitative assessment given Adam's characteristics. The likelihood and prior estimates could be adjusted with more specific data.
