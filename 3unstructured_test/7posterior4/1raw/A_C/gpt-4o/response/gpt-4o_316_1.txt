To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypotheses \( H \), and the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each hypothesis.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming we don't have specific statistical data for \( P(E) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(H) \) but instead rely on qualitative reasoning, we can make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s traits like high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts are quite relevant. However, empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature are less directly applicable.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common field of study, so the prior is moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This field is less common than Computer Science but given the strong alignment with Adam’s traits, the prior becomes more compelling.

Taking these into account, the qualitative assessments suggest the following probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | E) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) \approx 0.7
\]

Given these qualitative estimates, we present the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
