To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and the probability of the evidence (\( P(E) \)) are not provided, we will use relative likelihoods based on the match between Adam's personality sketch and each field to make an educated estimation.

Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on the given personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Highly relevant.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Highly relevant.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Relevant but not specific to this field.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant but general.

Given these points, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science should be relatively high.

### Computer Science:
- Enjoying solving puzzles: Highly relevant.
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant.
- Quiet and introspective nature: Often relevant for computer science.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Relevant but general.

Given these points, \( P(E|H) \) for computer science should also be relatively high but slightly less so compared to agricultural and veterinary science due to the lesser emphasis on the deep love for animals.

Let's assign educated likelihood values:

- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: 0.8
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: 0.6

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity in this estimation, the relative posterior probabilities can be given by these likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Normalization isn't necessary here as we're asked for relative probabilities.

Thus, the values are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
