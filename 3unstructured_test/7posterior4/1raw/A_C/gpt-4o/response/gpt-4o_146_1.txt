To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the following expression for each field:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided about Adam and general knowledge about the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and veterinary sciences might have a smaller number of graduate students compared to fields like computer science, but given Adam's love for nature and animals, let's assume a reasonable prior.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (5%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam has traits that are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences (love for nature, animals, understanding of hard work).
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is a normalization factor and typically involves summing over all possible hypotheses, but it's often complex to determine exactly. We'll assume it to normalize correctly.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is a highly popular graduate field with a large number of students.
   - Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which are traits associated with computer science students, but his strong empathy and love for animals are less typical.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.4 \) (40%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - Again, to normalize.

Since we have assumed these values, we'll get the ratio of \( P(H|E) \) for comparison purposes.

### Calculations (Comparing Ratios)

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) = 0.4 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

These results suggest that given the assumptions, Adam is more likely to be in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Result

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

Please note that these values are assumptions based on the information provided and general knowledge. Accurate probabilities would depend on more specific data about the distribution of traits among students in these fields.
