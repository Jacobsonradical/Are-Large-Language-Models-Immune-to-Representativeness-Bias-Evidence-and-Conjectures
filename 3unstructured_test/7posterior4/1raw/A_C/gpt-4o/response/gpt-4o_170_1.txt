To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we follow these steps:

1. **Formulate the problem**:
   - \( E \) is the evidence, which is the personality sketch of Adam.
   - \( H \) represents the hypotheses about Adam's field of study.
   
2. **Bayes' rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of \( H \) given \( E \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
   - \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll make educated estimations based on the given personality traits.

### Assumptions:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Agri-Vet Science)**:
  - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
  - He has a deep love for animals.
  - These traits are quite pertinent to this field, leading to a higher likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) \).

- **Computer Science (CS)**:
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
  - These traits fit well into computer science, indicating a reasonable likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \).

For simplicity, I'll estimate the probabilities qualitatively:

### Estimated Likelihoods and Priors:
- Let:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) = 0.8 \): High likelihood since the traits match well.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.6 \): Reasonable likelihood given his puzzle-solving and intelligence traits.

### Estimated Priors:
- \( P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) = 0.1 \): Assuming a smaller proportion of grad students are in Agri-Vet.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \): Assuming a larger proportion are in CS.

### Normalizing Factor:
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) \times P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \times P(H_{\text{CS}}) + \text{(other fields probabilities)}
\]

For simplicity, I'll assume other fields have been considered similarly, but we do not need to evaluate them as the sum does not need to be 1 here.

### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}} | E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
  \]

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \approx \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

Given the normalization factor cancels out in the ratio if we don't compare other fields:

\[
P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}} | E) \approx 0.08
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \approx 0.12
\]

### Final Approximation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "computer science": "0.12"
}
```

This shows a roughly higher posterior probability for Adam being in **Computer Science** compared to **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, given the traits described.
