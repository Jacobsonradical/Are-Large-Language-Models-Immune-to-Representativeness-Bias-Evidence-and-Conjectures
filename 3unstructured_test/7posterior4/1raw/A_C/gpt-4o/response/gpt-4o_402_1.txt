To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). 

However, in the absence of specific numerical data on these probabilities, we can provide qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch \( E \).

### Personality Sketch (E):
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor, enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Hypotheses (H):
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Aligns well with curiosity about nature and plants
   - Fits the love for animals
   - Consistent with appreciation for hard work
   
2. **Computer Science**
   - Aligns with enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts
   - High intelligence is relevant
   - Empathy and love for animals are less directly connected

Given this qualitative analysis, we can make an educated guess on the probabilities:

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are subjective but reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics of individuals in these fields. The probability for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher due to the stronger evidence of interest in nature and animals. The probability for "computer science" is significant but lower, as it is based more on his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
