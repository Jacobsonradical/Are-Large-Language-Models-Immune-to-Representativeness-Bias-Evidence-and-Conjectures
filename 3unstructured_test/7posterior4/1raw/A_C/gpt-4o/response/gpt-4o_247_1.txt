To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

However, without concrete data for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make reasoned estimates based on the information given.

Estimating \( P(E|H) \):
- For **computer science**, Adam's characteristics suggest above-average intelligence and a love for puzzles, which are relevant. However, his deep love for animals and nature might not align as strongly.
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well.

Estimating \( P(H) \):
- Computer science is a popular field in graduate studies and thus has a relatively high prior probability.
- Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but still significant.

The likelihood \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, so it acts as a normalizing factor.

Given these qualitative assessments:

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate to high
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): High

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Very high
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Moderate to high

Based on these estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}

These values reflect the probabilities that account for Adam's interest in nature and animals, alongside his intellectual abilities and affinity for puzzles.
