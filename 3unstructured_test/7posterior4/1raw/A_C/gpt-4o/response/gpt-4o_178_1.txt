To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \), where \( H \) can be being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or in computer science.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact probabilities for these values, I'll make logical estimates based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: In general, fewer graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to more popular fields such as computer science. However, given Adam's specific interests in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, the prior might be slightly higher for this field.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Considering his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood that someone with these traits would be studying agricultural and veterinary science is quite high.

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very popular field with a large number of graduate students enrolled. Thus, the prior probability is relatively high.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles fit well with computer science, his specific interests in nature and animals do not closely align with typical motivations for this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we do not have exact numeric values but can reason about relative probabilities. Here's a logical estimation based on the personality description:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's interests with agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature and animals, while also accounting for his skills which could be applicable to computer science.
