To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits E given the field H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the traits E, regardless of the field.

Because we do not have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate them. For clarity, we'll use ordinal measures to express our confidence between 0 and 1.

**For Computer Science:**

- **P(E|H):** Computer science students often have high intelligence and enjoy solving abstract problems. However, the strong empathy, deep love for animals, and warm-heartedness are less strongly associated with computer science.
- **P(H):** Considering the overall percentage of graduate students, computer science is a popular field.

Reasoning qualitatively:
\[ P(E|H) \text{ for Computer Science is moderate (say, around 0.4)}. \]
\[ P(H) \text{ for Computer Science is high (say, around 0.25 as an illustrative example)}. \]
\[ P(E) \text{ is the same for all fields and can be considered a normalizing constant }. \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- **P(E|H):** Students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science often have a strong appreciation for nature and animals, making this field a good match for Adam's traits.
- **P(H):** This field is less popular than computer science but still significant.

Reasoning qualitatively:
\[ P(E|H) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high (say, around 0.7)}. \]
\[ P(H) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is moderate to low (say, around 0.10 as an illustrative example)}. \]
\[ P(E) \text{ remains as the normalizing constant }. \]

Given the qualitative estimates we have:

\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Computer Science can be approximated as } \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)}. \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science can be approximated as } \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}. \]

For comparison only:
\[ \text{Ratio for Computer Science: } 0.4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.10. \]
\[ \text{Ratio for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: } 0.7 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07. \]

So the normalized conditional probabilities considering relative scales between these two fields are roughly in the following order:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} \approx 0.10 / 0.17 = 0.58 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \approx 0.07 / 0.17 = 0.41 \]

Therefore, expressing this in JSON format and maintaining a value within [0,1],

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.58",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.41"
}
```

Please note, due to lack of exact numerical data, these values are illustrative and hypothetical based on qualitative reasoning.
