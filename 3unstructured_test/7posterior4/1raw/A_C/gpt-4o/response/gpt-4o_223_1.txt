To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to formalize Bayes' theorem as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \) without considering the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

We will make some reasonable assumptions about the priors and likelihoods for simplicity, although in practice these values should be derived from relevant data, such as statistics on fields of study among graduate students and personality correlations with fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Priors \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) (Assume a relatively high number of graduates are in this field).
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \) (Less common than computer science).

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **computer science**: 
     - \( P(\text{curiosity about nature and plants}|\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \): Lower likelihood.
     - \( P(\text{warm heart, empathy, love for animals}|\text{computer science}) = 0.2 \): Lower likelihood since empathy and love for animals are not specifically related to CS.
     - \( P(\text{high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts}|\text{computer science}) = 0.8 \): Higher likelihood.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
     - \( P(\text{curiosity about nature and plants}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \): Higher likelihood.
     - \( P(\text{warm heart, empathy, love for animals}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \): Higher likelihood.
     - \( P(\text{high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts}|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.6 \): Reasonably high likelihood.

Given that the evidence \( E \) combines multiple traits, we need to combine these conditionally. 

For simplicity, assume \( P(E|H) \) is the product of individual likelihoods:

For **computer science (CS)**:
\[ P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.016 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science (AVS)**:
\[ P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.8 \times 0.7 \times 0.6 = 0.336 \]

### Normalize to find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS}) + \text{... other fields} \]

Given our assumptions:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.016 \cdot 0.2 + 0.336 \cdot 0.05 + \text{... small contributions from other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.0032 + 0.0168 + \text{... } \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 \]

### Compute posteriors:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.016 \cdot 0.2}{0.02} = 0.16 \]

\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.336 \cdot 0.05}{0.02} = 0.84 \]

Thus, we get:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84
}
```

This result indicates that, given the evidence \( E \) from Adam's personality sketch, it is significantly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
