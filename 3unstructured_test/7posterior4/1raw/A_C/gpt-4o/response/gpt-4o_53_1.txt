To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without additional numerical data regarding the base probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we need to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Qualitative Reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**: This field would generally attract someone with high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts. Adam's interest in solving puzzles also aligns well with computer science tasks. However, there isn't any direct mention of an interest in technology or coding, so while it's a fit, it isn't a perfect one based on the available information.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work seem to align strongly with this field. His empathy and warm heart also suggest a strong fit for veterinary science.

Given these qualitative observations, we can now estimate the posterior probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25, // Reflecting a partial but not perfect fit based on abstract thinking and puzzle-solving
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6  // Strong alignment with nature, animals, and empathy-related traits
}
```

Please note that these values are estimates based on qualitative alignment rather than precise numerical probabilities.
