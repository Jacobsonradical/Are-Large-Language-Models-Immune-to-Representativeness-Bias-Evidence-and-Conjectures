To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the given data and any relevant priors, likelihoods, and evidence. Unfortunately, since no specific numerical priors or likelihoods are provided for each field based on the information in the personality sketch, I can only provide a qualitative assessment.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence \( E \) (marginal likelihood).

Given the qualitative data from the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer some qualitative likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals greatly increases the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).
    - Usually, this field attracts students who have empathy for animals and an interest in nature.
    - Hence, the posterior \( P(H|E) \) should be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for this field, increasing \( P(E|H) \).
    - Enjoyment of solving puzzles also aligns well with the skills required in computer science.
    - However, the warm heart and strong empathy may not strictly be a significant attractor for this field in comparison to agricultural and veterinary science.

Without precise priors and likelihood data, we can't compute exact numerical values, but can provide a reasonable qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These numbers are just qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and their alignment with typical characteristics valued in these fields.
