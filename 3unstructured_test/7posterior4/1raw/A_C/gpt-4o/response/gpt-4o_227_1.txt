To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we lack concrete data for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, we'll hypothesize reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and subject characteristics. The evidence \( E \) includes Adamâ€™s deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.

Let's break it down for the two fields identified:

1. **Computer Science (CS)**
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood that someone in computer science matches Adam's personality traits (quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence). This is reasonably high given that many in CS tend to enjoy puzzles, have high intelligence, and appreciate hard work.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that an individual is studying computer science. This is also relatively high given the popularity of the field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood that someone in agricultural and veterinary science matches Adam's traits (love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy). This is very high given the direct alignment with his interests.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability that an individual is studying agricultural and veterinary science. This is lower than computer science due to the specialization of the field.

For precise calculation, specific numerical values for these probabilities are required, but we can offer a qualitative assessment based on the given context.

Considering these qualitative assessments, let's assign some illustrative conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Although his intelligence and love for solving puzzles align with CS, the field doesn't fully encompass his strong empathy, love for animals, and nature - hence, lower than AVS.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: His personality traits are highly compatible with this field, making it a more probable match based on the given details.
