To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated as the sum of the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of each hypothesis.

Bayes' Rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can still make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- People studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science might generally share a deep love for animals, nature, and plants.
- Graduate programs in this field are smaller compared to other more prevalent fields, hence \( P(H) \) might be relatively low to medium.

#### Likelihood (P(E|H))
- Given Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, and plants, empathy, and hard work), it is highly likely that he would fit well in this field.

### Hypothesis 2: Computer Science
#### Prior Probability (P(H))
- Computer Science is a very common field with a large number of graduate students, so \( P(H) \) is generally high.

#### Likelihood (P(E|H))
- Although Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with Computer Science, his passion for nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant to this field compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the posterior probability for Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be higher than for Computer Science, based on the personality evidence provided.

### Qualitative Posterior Probabilities
Let's assign some qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values suggest that, based on his personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science.
