To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the components of Bayes' rule itself:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of the evidence.

For simplicity and due to the lack of specific numerical values, we will make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch of Adam. We'll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal, which is a common approach when there is no strong evidence to the contrary.

Let's assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which is a trait beneficial in computer science.
   - He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which complement computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals suggest he might be less drawn to a field that can be perceived as more technical and programming-focused, rather than hands-on with nature or animals.

   \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate to low - Let's assign it a qualitative value of 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals, which align well with veterinary science.
   - These traits, combined with his appreciation for hard work and dedication, are very indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

   \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \): High - Let's assign it a qualitative value of 0.8.

Given that both hypotheses (fields of study) initially have equal priors \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AgVet}) = 0.5 \):

Using Bayes' rule qualitatively, we get:

{
  "computer science":  \(\frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.15 / P(E)\),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.4 / P(E)\)
}

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant common to both, we can simplify to relative values (it will cancel out when comparing them):

{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}

In summary, in qualitative terms, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science based on the provided personality sketch.
