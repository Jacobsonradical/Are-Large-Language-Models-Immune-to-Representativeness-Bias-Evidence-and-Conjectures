To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Define Bayes' Rule for the problem:**
   \[
   P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Determine the likelihoods \( P(E \mid H) \):**
   - \( P(E \mid H_{\text{computer science}}) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E \mid H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality sketch, given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Determine the prior probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - These are typically the general proportions of students enrolled in each field. However, since exact values aren't provided, we will assume equal priors for simplicity. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \).

4. **Determine the marginal probability \( P(E) \):**
   - This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), considering all possible fields Adam might be in. For simplicity, we will conceptually denote it as a normalization constant ensuring that the total probability integrates to 1 over all possible hypotheses.

Assumptions:
- Since Adam has a deep love for animals and an appreciation for hard work related to nature, the likelihood of \( P(E \mid H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would naturally be higher compared to computer science.
- His understanding of abstract concepts leans slightly towards fields like computer science, but given his profound empathy for animals and interests in nature, the agricultural and veterinary sciences might align better overall.

Given these qualitative insights and simplifying assumptions, we formulate rough values for the likelihoods:

\[
P(E \mid H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(E \mid H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8
\]

Now, let's plug these into Bayes' rule:

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
  \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
  \]

We notice that \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant. To represent the probabilities relative to each other, we ignore \( P(E) \) but ensure that \( P(E) \) corrects the total probability otherwise.

Thus:

- Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and can be ignored for relative comparison, we get relative ratios:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer science}} \mid E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2
  \]
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \mid E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
  \]

Given these computations, our final approximations are:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
