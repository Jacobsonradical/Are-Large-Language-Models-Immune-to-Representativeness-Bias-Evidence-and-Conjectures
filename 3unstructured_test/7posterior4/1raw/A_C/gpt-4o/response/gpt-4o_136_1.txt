To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule for Adam, we need to start with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were indeed in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is in that field, before considering his personality.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up to 1 across all possible fields (which we do not need here as we'll be looking at the fields independently).

Since actual numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, I will make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the given information. 

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, the hypotheses we are considering are:
1. \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.

**Reasoning for probabilities:**

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(E|H)**: High, as his love for nature, plants, and animals fits very well with this field.
- **P(H)**: We would assume that the prior for students in agriculture and veterinary science can be reasonably guessed to be moderate to low, relative to other fields.

### Computer Science:
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, as his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles align, but it's less aligned with his love for animals and nature.
- **P(H)**: Prior probability for students in computer science would generally be high, given its popularity and high enrollment in graduate programs in the U.S.

### Numerical Estimations:
Given the qualitative reasoning, I'll assign higher values to the likelihood of observation fitting with agricultural and veterinary science and moderate values for computer science.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are estimates. They capture the qualitative understanding of how Adam's personality traits align with each field. Actual numbers would require more detailed statistical data about enrollments and typical personality traits within those graduate fields.
