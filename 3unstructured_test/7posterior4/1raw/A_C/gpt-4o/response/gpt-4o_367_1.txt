To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, as well as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't know the exact priors \( P(H) \) and the evidence \( P(E) \), we will provide a qualitative estimation based on the match between the personality sketch and the characteristics generally associated with each field.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These characteristics are highly consistent with someone in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agri and vet}}) \) is high.

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence.
- Good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Enjoy solving puzzles.

These traits are consistent with someone in computer science, but the sketch has more explicitly strong matches with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative estimation, we will assign higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science, but still a non-negligible probability to computer science due to the intelligence and abstract thinking traits.
