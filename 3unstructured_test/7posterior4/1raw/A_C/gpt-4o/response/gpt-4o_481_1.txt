To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and we are only comparing the relative values, we can focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

To proceed, we need some assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, independent of the personality sketch. Without specific data, we might assume these priors to be equal, but real priors would depend on popularity and enrollment statistics of these fields.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field. This is where Adam's traits align more with certain fields than others.

Consider each field:

### 1. Computer Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's traits such as high intelligence, good at solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align well with someone in computer science.
  - Traits like genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are less indicative of a computer science student but not incompatible.
  - Score: Moderately high.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, warm heart, and strong empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are also relevant but not as specific.
  - Score: High.

Given we don't have specific numbers, we can conceptualize the likelihoods qualitatively:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.9 \]

If we assume equal priors for simplicity (i.e., \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \)):

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.5 = 0.45 \]

Given these calculations, we can provide a normalized answer for clarity:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.45} \approx 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.3 + 0.45} \approx 0.6 \]

Thus, in summary:

{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
