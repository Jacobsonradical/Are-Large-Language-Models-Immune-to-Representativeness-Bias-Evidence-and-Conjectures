To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \), which can be considered a normalization factor.

Without specific statistical data to work with, we have to rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities. We'll assume \( P(H) \) to be roughly similar across different fields, given that we don't have any reason to believe one field is innately more probable than the other for Adam. So we will focus on \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam (with the described personality sketch) being in each field.

Considering Adam's personality:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**: While Adam's intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are relevant here, other aspects such as his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly point toward this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field, making it highly likely.

Given the qualitative assessment, we can estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{comp}) \) (likelihood for computer science) is relatively low due to partial match.
- \( P(E|H_{agri}) \) (likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science) is relatively high due to strong alignment.

Our qualitative estimates result in:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
``` 

These values represent the relatively higher probability of Adam being in the agricultural and veterinary science field compared to computer science given his personality sketch.
