To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis (field of study), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing evidence \(E\).

Let's break down the given data:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He enjoys solving puzzles.
3. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits and assuming we have some prior knowledge on the distribution of students in different fields and how these traits correlate with those fields, we can make educated estimates:

### Computer Science

1. **P(E|H)**: Given that someone is a computer science student, the likelihood they enjoy solving puzzles (high), have high intelligence (high), and good abstract thinking skills (high) is significant. 
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student being in computer science can be considered moderate to high, as computer science is a popular field of study.
3. **P(E)**: Probability of observing the given evidence in the general student population.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(E|H)**: Given that someone is an agricultural and veterinary science student, it is highly likely they have a curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication (high).
2. **P(H)**: Prior probability of a student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower given the smaller relative size of this field compared to computer science.
3. **P(E)**: Probability of observing the given evidence in the general student population.

Without exact statistical data, here are educated guesses based on traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are subjective estimates based on the provided personality sketch and common correlations with the mentioned fields. A more accurate computation would require precise data regarding the distributions of personality traits among graduate students in each field.
