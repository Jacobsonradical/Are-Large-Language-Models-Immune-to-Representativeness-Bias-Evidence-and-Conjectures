To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the given field based on his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits, given he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the given personality traits.

Given the nature of the problem and without specific data, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the description:

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(E|H) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" might be high due to Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy.
2. \( P(E|H) \) for "computer science" might be moderate due to his enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, though it doesn't align as closely with nature and animals.

Without concrete statistical data, I'll provide qualitatively reasoned estimations for the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, say 0.7, since the traits' alignment is strong.
   - \( P(H) \): This probability might be lower as fewer graduate students enroll in this field, say 0.1.
   
2. **Computer science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, say 0.4, since only some traits align well.
   - \( P(H) \): This probability might be higher due to more common enrollment, say 0.2.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is approximately the same for both fields since we are looking at the relative probabilities. If \( P(E) \) is constant, our focus is on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) as a relative measure.

### Calculation (Simplified):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{AG} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

### Final Probabilities (Normalized for both fields):

Since the calculations show that "computer science" has a slightly higher relative score using our simplified method, we normalize these values to provide the probabilities:

\[ P(H|E)_{AG} = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.08} \approx 0.467 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{CS} = \frac{0.08}{0.07 + 0.08} \approx 0.533 \]
