To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch, we would ideally use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since the exact base rates \( P(H) \) (the prior probabilities of students being in each field) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the personality sketch given the field) are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the likelihood of observing this personality sketch if Adam is in this field \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
   - The base rate \( P(H) \) for this field might be lower compared to more common fields like computer science.

2. **Computer science**:
   - Adam’s problem-solving skills and high intelligence align well with computer science, so the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high.
   - The base rate \( P(H) \) for this field is one of the highest among graduate programs.

### Normalizing Constants:
Since the exact base rates and denominators for normalization are not strictly needed to compare relative strengths, we can represent probabilities directly as likelihoods here.

Hence, we don't compute exact values but rather present likelihood-based conditional estimations.

### Estimated Probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

### Reasoning:
1. **Agricultural and veterinary science (0.7)**:
   - Fits Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - Adam’s appreciation for hard work aligns with this field’s practical, hands-on nature.

2. **Computer science (0.5)**:
   - Fits Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving preferences.
   - Abstract thinking is also a key component of computer science.

Since both fields align reasonably well with Adam's personality traits, agricultural and veterinary science was rated higher (0.7) due to a stronger fit with specific traits related to nature and animals. The computer science field still holds a strong likelihood (0.5) due to traits like problem-solving and abstract thinking.

Therefore, these values represent relative strengths in the context provided, without requiring absolute normalization.
