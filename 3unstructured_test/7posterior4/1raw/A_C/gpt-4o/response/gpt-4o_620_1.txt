To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the exact probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided explicitly in the description. Therefore, we will estimate these probabilities based on the given information.

### Estimation:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
    - We assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is equal, given no other information. Thus, \( P(H) \) for any single field is low, considering there are many possible fields of graduate study.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
    - **For agricultural and veterinary science:**
      Given Adamâ€™s love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, \( P(E|H) \) would be high in this field.
    - **For computer science:**
      Given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, \( P(E|H) \) would also be reasonably high for this field due to the analytical nature of computer science.

### Simplified Estimation:
Given the lack of exact prior and normalization constant \( P(E) \), we rely on qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This distribution reflects a higher posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's strong empathy and love for animals, aligning closely with his personality sketch.
