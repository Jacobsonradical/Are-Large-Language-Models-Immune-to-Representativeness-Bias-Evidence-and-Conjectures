To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express it in terms of the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the fields of specialization, we need to estimate the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field and the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field. Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the described personality traits and the typical characteristics needed for those fields.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

### Likelihood Estimations

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** High likelihood.
2. **Warm heart and empathy:** High relevance, especially for working with animals.
3. **Love for animals:** Directly aligns.
4. **High intelligence and abstract concepts:** Relevant, though not as critical as the earlier traits.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Very relevant.

From this, \( P(E|H_1) \) is quite high.

**Computer Science (H2)**:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants:** Less relevant.
2. **Warm heart and empathy:** Not typically emphasized in the field.
3. **Love for animals:** Irrelevant.
4. **High intelligence and abstract concepts:** Very relevant.
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Very relevant.

From this, \( P(E|H_2) \) is lower compared to \( P(E|H_1) \) but still significant due to certain traits being highly relevant.

### Priors
Assuming no prior information about the distribution of graduate students in these fields:
- \( P(H_1) \): Probability of enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science: moderately low due to fewer graduate students in this field.
- \( P(H_2) \): Probability of enrollment in computer science: moderately high due to a larger number of students in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate these probabilities:
- \( P(H_1): \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_2): \approx 0.4 \)

To simplify, let:
- \( P(E) \): Normalization factor common to both fields (since we aren't asked to sum to 1, we avoid explicit computation).

### Posterior Estimation
Given the qualitative understandings:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \]
  Therefore:
  \[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.16 / P(E) \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(E|H_2) \approx 0.4 \]
  Therefore:
  \[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \approx 0.16 / P(E) \]

Since the common denominator \( P(E) \) is the same, we can implicitly compare the numerators directly for the relative posterior probabilities.

### Result
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16 / P(E),
  "computer science": 0.16 / P(E)
}
```

Based on this proportional comparison, there is an equally likely chance for Adam to be in either field considering the provided attributes, although these are just estimates without exact numeric values. More context on relative student populations or additional traits could change this assessment.
