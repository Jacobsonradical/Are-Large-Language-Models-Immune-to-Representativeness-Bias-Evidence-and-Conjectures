To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the context and attributes of Adam's personality sketch, we can make educated guesses about these probabilities. Since we do not have the exact numerical values, we have to use domain knowledge and reasonable assumptions.

First, let’s consider the agricultural and veterinary science field:

1. **P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science\)**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam has a deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, which aligns well with studying agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than some others, so \( P(H) \) may be moderate to low.
   - **P(E)**: The probability of observing Adam's specific combination of traits in the general population of graduate students. This might be relatively low.

Based on these thoughts:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) \approx 0.65 \]

2. **P(H|E) for computer science**
   - **P(E|H)**: While Adam shows high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts—traits that are common in computer science students—his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature don't directly suggest an affinity for computer science. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in computer science. This field is very common, so \( P(H) \) is high.
   - **P(E)**: The same as above, this might be relatively low.

Based on these thoughts:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E) \approx 0.20 \]

This can be summarized into the following format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

Please note that these values are based on logical assumptions and the traits described in Adam's personality sketch. Quantitative context or more specific data might adjust these probabilities.
