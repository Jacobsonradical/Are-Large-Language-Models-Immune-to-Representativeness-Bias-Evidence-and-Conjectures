Unfortunately, without specific prior probabilities for each field (P(H)) or the likelihoods of each field given Adam's personality sketch (P(E|H)), it is impossible to compute the exact posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' Rule. However, based on qualitative reasoning from the information provided in the personality sketch, we can infer the likelihoods qualitatively.

From the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He values hard work and dedication.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.

Given these characteristics:
1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts could fit many scientific disciplines, including computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles is typically associated with analytical fields like computer science.

So, while we can't provide exact probabilities without more data, we can suggest that Adam's likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science might be higher than that for computer science due to his strong affinity for nature and animals.

Here is a qualitative assessment in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "relatively high, perhaps around 0.6 to 0.8",
  "computer science": "moderate to low, perhaps around 0.2 to 0.4"
}
```

Remember, these values are heuristic and reflect qualitative reasoning rather than precise probabilities calculated through Bayes' Rule.
