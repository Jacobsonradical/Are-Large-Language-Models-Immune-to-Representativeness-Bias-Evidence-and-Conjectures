To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field (e.g., agricultural and veterinary science or computer science).
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \).

However, since we do not have explicit numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we need to make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in the mentioned fields.

Let's consider the key aspects of Adam's personality sketch:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
6. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: High, because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
- **P(H)**: Prior is moderately high, as many students in this field exhibit these traits.
- **P(E)**: Given these traits are valuable in many fields, the marginal likelihood is moderately balanced.

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence suit this field. However, the deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less directly relevant.
- **P(H)**: Prior could be broad, as many students in computer science might have varied interests and aptitudes.
- **P(E)**: Traits like high intelligence and problem-solving ability are common in various fields, including Computer Science.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are subjective estimates and should ideally be refined with more precise data about the actual distribution of students' characteristics in each field.
