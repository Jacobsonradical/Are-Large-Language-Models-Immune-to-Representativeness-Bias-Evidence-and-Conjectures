To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we should ideally have access to prior probabilities for each hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Without concrete numerical data for these terms, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided sketch of Adam's personality and interests.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H)):** Assuming that Adam could have been enrolled in any specific field but with a higher prior probability for fields typically associated with his interests:
    - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H)):** 
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is more likely that these traits are better aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E)):** This consolidates the probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses. For a simplistic approach, we can assume a sum of the Joint probabilities normalized:
   - \( P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.8 = 0.02 + 0.56 = 0.58 \)

Given these assumptions, we can compute the posterior probabilities:

For **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.58} \approx 0.0345 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science|E}) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.8}{0.58} \approx 0.9655 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.0345",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9655"
}
