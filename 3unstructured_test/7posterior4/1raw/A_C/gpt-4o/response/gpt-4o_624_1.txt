To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and normalizing constant. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Since exact numerical values for the priors and likelihoods are not provided, we'll make estimations based on the personality sketch and typical distributions for graduate students in these fields:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Computer science is a broadly popular field, so it would have a higher prior \( P(H_{cs}) \).
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is more specialized, so it would have a lower prior \( P(H_{agri}) \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{agri}) \), where \( H_{agri} \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science, would be relatively high.
   - For computer science, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is lower since abstract concepts and problem-solving fit, but the nature and animals part do not align as well.

Assuming approximate, illustrative priors and likelihoods:

- Prior for computer science (\( P(H_{cs}) \)): 0.3
- Prior for agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(H_{agri}) \)): 0.1

- Likelihood for computer science (\( P(E|H_{cs}) \)): 0.2
- Likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(E|H_{agri}) \)): 0.7

To simplify, we will avoid calculating \( P(E) \) since it is a normalizing constant and focus on the relative comparison:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

So, our approximations would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These are not normalized probabilities, but they indicate that based on the given evidence, Adam has a slightly higher likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
