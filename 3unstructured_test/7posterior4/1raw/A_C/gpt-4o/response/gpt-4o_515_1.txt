To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) and using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and likelihoods of each hypothesis given the evidence. The formula for Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence, which is the same for all models being compared.

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities or the likelihoods, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in the sketch \( E \) about Adam.

### Assumptions:
- **Computer Science**: While Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that are good fits for computer science, his strong empathy and deep love for nature and animals are less typical for this field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align closely with this field.

### Likelihoods:
1. \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate to low.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High.

### Prior Probabilities:
1. \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate due to the popularity of the field.
2. \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Lower relative to computer science in terms of overall graduate school enrollments but more fitting to the personality.

### Simplified Calculation:
Given these qualitative assessments, we can approximate the posterior probabilities. Let's assume equal priors for the sake of simplicity, but the likelihood significantly differentiates the hypotheses.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This reflects our qualitative assessment that Adamâ€™s personality traits align more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Computer Science. Of course, for a more accurate evaluation, one would use actual data on enrollments and likelihoods.
