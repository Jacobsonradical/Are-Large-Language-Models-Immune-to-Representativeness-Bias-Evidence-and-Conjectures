To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the steps below:

First, Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that you are only interested in the probabilities for two specific fields (agricultural and veterinary science and computer science), we can calculate the probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field. However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality description provided (E).

Let's assume:
1. \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
3. \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is the likelihood of E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
4. \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is the likelihood of E given that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
5. \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of E regardless of the field.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- High curiosity about nature and plants suggests a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
- Strong empathy and love for animals also suggest a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might be slightly more neutral but could favor computer science slightly.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply to both fields.

Let's denote the following likelihoods reasonably based on the given description:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \) (high likelihood due to nature, animals, empathy)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \) (moderate likelihood)

Now, assuming equal priors for simplicity:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

We calculate the normalization factor \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.5) + (0.4 \cdot 0.5) = 0.35 + 0.2 = 0.55 \]

Finally, we calculate the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.55} = \frac{0.35}{0.55} \approx 0.636 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{0.55} = \frac{0.2}{0.55} \approx 0.364 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities can be approximated as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636,
  "computer science": 0.364
}
