To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) denotes the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) denotes the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) denotes the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) denotes the total probability of evidence E.

Without specific numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must qualitatively assess relative probabilities based on the given personality sketch. Given Adam's interests and traits, we can make informed guesses.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns well with skills needed in computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less directly related.
    - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field for intelligent students, possibly skewing priors toward general higher enrollment.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants and animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than computer science, but the passion for animals and nature strongly suggests this alignment.

Given these considerations, we can qualitatively estimate relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect that while Adam's traits have some relevance to computer science, they are much more directly applicable to agricultural and veterinary science.
