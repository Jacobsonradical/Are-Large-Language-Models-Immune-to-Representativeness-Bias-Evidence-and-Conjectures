To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate how well Adam's personality sketch \( E \) matches typical students in each field, as well as the base rate of graduate students in each field.

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a graduate student being in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which normalizes the posterior probabilities.

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods from empirical data, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

### Step-by-Step Estimation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \) is relatively high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - His intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science.
   - The likelihood \( P(E|H \text{ for Computer Science}) \) is also high but might be slightly lower because his love for animals and nature isn't as closely related to this field.

Assuming the estimates for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are roughly equal (given no specific data), we can then assign relative values to the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume a likelihood of 0.8.
- For Computer Science, let's assume a likelihood of 0.7.

#### Normalizing the Probabilities
Since we are told that we don't need to ensure the total sums to 1 due to other possible fields, normalization isn’t necessary for the specific request. However, let's provide normalized values as an exercise:

\[ P(E|Agricultural) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|ComputerScience) = 0.7 \]

The sum is \( 0.8 + 0.7 = 1.5 \).

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(Agricultural|E) = \frac{0.8}{1.5} = \approx 0.533 \]
\[ P(ComputerScience|E) = \frac{0.7}{1.5} = \approx 0.467 \]

However, without exact data \( P(E) \) and specifics on priors, I’ll provide relative likelihoods directly:

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.53",
  "computer science": "0.47"
}
```

These values are a simplified quantitative approximation consistent with the qualitative assessment of Adam's personality traits relative to these fields.
