To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H_i | E) = \frac{P(E | H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H_i | E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H_i \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E | H_i) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H_i \).
- \( P(H_i) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H_i \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have precise numerical values for \( P(E | H_i) \), \( P(H_i) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll use educated assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with these fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H) \): Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, all of which align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E | H) \) can be considered high.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assuming a reasonable number of students select this field, the prior can be considered moderate if we don't have strong external statistics to sway it otherwise.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with the ability to understand abstract concepts, traits beneficial in computer science. Therefore, \( P(E | H) \) can be considered moderate to high.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Given the popularity of computer science among graduate students, this prior might be high.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity, we focus on the likelihoods which react directly to the evidence provided in the personality sketch. High likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science due to the nature interest and good likelihood for computer science due to the puzzle-solving affinity.

Given these considerations and the typicality of traits across these disciplines, let's provide our educated estimations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These estimates indicate that based on Adam's interests and characteristics, he is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
