To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to express the relationship mathematically. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case:

- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( E \) represents the personality sketch of Adam.

We need the following probabilities for each field:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch if Adam was enrolled in that field. This is the likelihood.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in that field before considering the personality sketch.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make reasoned assumptions based on the available information.

### Assumption-based Calculation

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, this field is highly compatible.
2. **P(H)**: We'd assume that the field of agricultural and veterinary science has a lower enrollment compared to fields like computer science, but Adam's interests fit well here.
3. **P(E)**: This is constant across all fields but higher for fields highly compatible with his personality.

**Computer Science:**
1. **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts, this field is also somewhat compatible but lacks direct alignment with his love for nature and animals.
2. **P(H)**: Computer Science typically has a high enrollment rate for graduate students.
3. **P(E)**: Again, this is constant but less compatible directly with his love for nature and animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Taking these factors into consideration, we can hypothesize reasonable values between 0 and 1 for the posterior probabilities.
