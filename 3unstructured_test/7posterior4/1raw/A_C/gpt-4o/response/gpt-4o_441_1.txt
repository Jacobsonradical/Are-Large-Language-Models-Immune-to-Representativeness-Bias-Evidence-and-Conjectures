To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow this formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), we cannot compute exact numerical values. Instead, we can reason qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{ag} \) = "Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science"
- \( H_{cs} \) = "Adam was enrolled in computer science"
- \( E \) = Personality sketch of Adam

### Analysis
#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it is highly consistent with someone who might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with this field, which often requires long hours and a passion for living beings.

\[ P(E|H_{ag}) \] is likely high.

#### Computer Science
Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, particularly in abstract concepts, would fit well with a field like computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals seems less directly connected to computer science unless it intersected with a niche area such as computational biology or environmental modeling.

\[ P(E|H_{cs}) \] is moderate but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.

### Posterior Probabilities
While we can't give precise numerical values without additional context and data, we can provide a qualitative comparison:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7 - 0.9",
  "computer science": "0.3 - 0.5"
}
```

These ranges suggest that, given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, but there's still a reasonable possibility of him being in computer science, especially if there's a relevant sub-discipline.
