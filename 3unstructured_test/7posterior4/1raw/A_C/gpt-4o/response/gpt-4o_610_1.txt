To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to adjust the equation based on general information available in the problem prompt since specific prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the sketch E and the details provided, we can make educated guesses about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field by analyzing the fit of Adamâ€™s personality characteristics to the typical expectations of those fields. 

### Computer Science
- **Understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence** could suggest a fit.
- People in computer science can also have a preference for solitary problem-solving (such as solving puzzles).

However, no specific traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity towards nature and plants point directly to computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants**, **warm heart and strong empathy**, and **deep love for animals** are direct indicators.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication also support this field.

Given these considerations, the fit for agricultural and veterinary science seems much stronger based on the personality sketch provided.

### Making Educated Estimates:

We'll assume that there is a certain base rate for these fields among graduate students (prior probability \(P(H)\)), and some subjective approximate likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, we are focusing on the qualitative aspects rather than exact numbers.

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) for computer science might be moderate, something like 0.2 for abstract problem-solving but less for empathy and love for nature/animals.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \), the base rate, is likely decent for CS fields.
  
- \( P(E|H_{\text{Ag/Vet}}) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is quite high since almost all descriptors align well.
- \( P(H_{\text{Ag/Vet}}) \), the base rate, might be lower than CS on average but not insignificant.

Accordingly, but again qualitatively due to lack of exact figures:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This creates a qualitative impression that agricultural and veterinary science is a much better fit for Adam based on the provided personality sketch.
