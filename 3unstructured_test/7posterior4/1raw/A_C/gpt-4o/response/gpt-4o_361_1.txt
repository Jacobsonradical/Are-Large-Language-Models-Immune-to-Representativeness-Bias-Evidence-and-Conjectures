To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. \( P(E | H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Because we lack specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, I'll provide a qualitative analysis instead and assign reasonable likelihoods based on the personality sketch of Adam.

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Nature interest: High relevance.
   - Love for animals: High relevance.
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work: Relevant.
   - Curiosity about plants: Very relevant.
   Thus, \( P(E | H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.

2. Computer Science:
   - Solving puzzles: High relevance.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High relevance.
   - Nature and animals: Low to moderate relevance.
   Thus, \( P(E | H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.

Given these likelihoods and assuming relatively equal prior probabilities (if no other specific data is given):

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} | E) = \frac{\text{High} \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{\text{Moderate} \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}
\]

By assigning reasonable values based on this qualitative analysis:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Note: These values are not strictly numerical but rather indicative based on the personality traits given.
