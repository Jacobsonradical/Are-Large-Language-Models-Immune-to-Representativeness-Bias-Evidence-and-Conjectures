To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several things, such as the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given each field. For simplicity, let's assume we don't have specific prior probabilities but will base our estimates on how well Adam's personality matches each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

As exact numerical values for the priors and likelihoods are not given, we will derive reasonable estimates based on the information provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants aligns well with this field.
   - His deep love for animals is a strong indicator.
   - His empathy and warm heart are also good matches for a field involving care for living beings.
   - Assuming his high intelligence and appreciation for hard work are general traits that fit well in most fields.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which is a key trait for success in computer science.
   - His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also align well with computer science.
   - However, his deep love for animals and nature is less directly relevant to computer science.

Using these qualitative assessments:

\[ P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \] would be high due to strong alignment with traits like love for animals and curiosity about nature.
\[ P(E|H_\text{computer science}) \] would also be significant due to his intelligence and love for puzzles but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science due to the lesser relevance of his love for nature and animals.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) and \( P(H_\text{computer science}) \):

\[ \frac{P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E|H_\text{computer science})} \approx \frac{0.7}{0.3} \]

Thus, simplified estimates could look like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
