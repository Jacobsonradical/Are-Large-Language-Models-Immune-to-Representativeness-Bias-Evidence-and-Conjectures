To use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the personality sketch.

Let's make some simplifications and assumptions for this calculation due to the lack of comprehensive field-specific data.

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - We will assume that each field has an equal prior probability of enrollment initially. While not strictly true, this allows us to focus on the likelihoods to see how each field fits the description better.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **Computer Science**: The personality sketch mentions high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, both of which are relevant. However, there is no specific mention of skills directly tied to coding or computer science.
   - For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The personality sketch has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which fits very well with this field.

We give qualitative assessments for the likelihoods based on the sketch's compatibility with these fields.

Let's assign subjective values based on the qualitative assessment:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \)

Since the outcome doesn't need to conform to true priors and only serve to illustrate the method, we initially assign equal priors, say 0.5 to both fields.

3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   
Since we don't know the actual distribution of students in different fields at the specified time, we simplify by assuming the total \( P(E) \) can be factored proportionately among our hypothesized fields for the demonstration:

Given these value, we compute:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given equal priors:
\( P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) = P(H_{\text{ag vet sci}}) = 0.5 \).

\( P(E) \) can be approximated such that contribution of both hypotheses are factors as kept small for isolating
\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ag vet sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag vet sci}})
\]

\[
P(E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.5 + 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5
\]

Finally, our posterior computation:
\[
P(H_{\text{comp sci}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{ag vet sci}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These generalized results match initial impression: Gardening, love for nature & animals link far stronger to agriculture and veterinary science than to computer science.
