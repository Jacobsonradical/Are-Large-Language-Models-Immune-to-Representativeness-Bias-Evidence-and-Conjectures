To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to know the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since these are not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the description, but please note that in a real-world scenario, you would need actual data to compute these probabilities correctly.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's assume:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for both fields is the same (since no specific prior information is provided). For simplicity, let's denote it as \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AV}) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E) \) can be presumed to be equal for a comparison purpose since we are not given specific details about the total probability of the evidence.

Thus, we compare the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{AV}) \):

- For "computer science," the evidence includes traits like high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which fit well with this field. However, elements like a strong empathy and a love for nature and animals may not be as strong indicators for this field.

- For "agricultural and veterinary science," the evidence includes a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly aligned with this field.

Assuming:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \sim 0.3 \): While intelligence and problem-solving skills are important, some of Adam's characteristics are less aligned with computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \sim 0.7 \): Many of Adam's traits closely match with those expected in agricultural and veterinary science.

Using Bayes' rule, the relative posterior probabilities can be computed as follows (considering \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AV}) \), the term \( P(E) \) will cancel out):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

So, in summary:

{
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.35"
}

This indicates that based on the given personality sketch and the assumptions made, Adam is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science. However, actual prior probabilities and more detailed information could alter these estimates.
