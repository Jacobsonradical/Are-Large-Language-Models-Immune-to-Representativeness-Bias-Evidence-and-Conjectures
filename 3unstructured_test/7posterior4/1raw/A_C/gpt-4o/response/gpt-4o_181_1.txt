To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific information on the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we can only make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch.

### Prior Analysis:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam's love for solving puzzles and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts are favorable traits for a computer science student.
   - The link between his traits and computer science is reasonable, though not as strong as for some other fields directly related to nature.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   
### Simplified Estimates:

Given the strong alignment for agricultural and veterinary science and a reasonable alignment for computer science, these priors and likelihoods seem more favorable for the former.

Without rigorous numerical data:

\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) \approx \frac{(high) \cdot (relatively lower)}{(common)} \]
\[ P(H_{comp-sci}|E) \approx \frac{(moderate) \cdot (relatively higher)}{(common)} \]

Given the above qualitative analysis, here's a reasonable estimate of the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3, // given modest alignment
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 // given strong alignment
}

Please note these probabilities are heuristic and for illustrative purposes without empirical data.
