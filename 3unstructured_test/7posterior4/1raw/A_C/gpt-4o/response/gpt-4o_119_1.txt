To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need four components:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.
4. \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical data, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
      - Adam has a strong intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are highly relevant to computer science.
      - Solving puzzles can be related to problem-solving in computer science.
      - However, there is no direct mention of interests related to computers or programming.

    Assuming \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).

    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
      - Computer science is a popular field among graduate students in the U.S.
      
    Assuming \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \).

    - **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
      - This is a normalization factor that sums contributions across all relevant fields but isn't directly needed for comparison if we are only interested in relative magnitudes.
      
    Assuming \( P(E) \) is reasonably normalized.

    \[
    P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)}
    \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
      - Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, empathy, and a love for animals, all of which strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
      - His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with this field.

    Assuming \( P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.9 \).

    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
      - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than computer science but still a significant field.
      
    Assuming \( P(H_{avs}) = 0.05 \).

    - **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
      - Again, this is a normalization factor accounting for all fields.
      
    Assuming \( P(E) \) is reasonably normalized.

    \[
    P(H_{avs}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.045}{P(E)}
    \]

Putting these into relative magnitudes:
\[
{
  "computer science": \frac{0.1}{P(E)},
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.045}{P(E)}
}
\]

To convert these into numerical values between 0 and 1, and considering the nature of comparison:
\[
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
\]

Final assumption: 

Assuming the normalization for comparison without affecting proportional relativity:
\[
\{ "computer science": 0.1, "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 \}
\]
