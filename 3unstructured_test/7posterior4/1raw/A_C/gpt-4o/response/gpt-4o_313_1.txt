To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand the formulation of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence E.

For the given fields:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
2. **Computer Science**

Let’s denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.

To make our calculations, let's assume that \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \) reflect how well Adam's personality sketch matches students typically enrolled in these fields.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, as well as warm empathy, it is more likely that \( P(E|H_1) \) (for Agricultural and Veterinary Science) will be higher than \( P(E|H_2) \) (for Computer Science).

Without specific data on \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) (the general likelihood of students enrolling in each field), and assuming prior probabilities and marginal evidence are equally likely across fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_1) \) should be high because of the alignment with Adam’s interests and personality traits.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_2) \) should be lower given the mismatch with using nature and empathy.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.2 \)

We’ll assume prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \approx P(H_2) \approx 0.5 \) and the marginal \( P(E) \approx 1 \).

Using these estimates, we can now provide the posterior as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

Please note that these estimates are subjective due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods based on actual data. They are based purely on the thematic fit between Adam’s personality and the characteristics typically associated with each field.
