To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need information about the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). However, since we don't have this information, we can make reasoned assumptions based on the provided personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

We will make qualitative assessments instead of precise numerical calculations, yielding an estimated probability between 0 and 1 based on the alignment of Adam's traits with each field.

### Conditional Likelihoods:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a strong empathy, and a deep love for animals highly align with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be high.
    
2. **Computer Science:**
    - Traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, fewer traits uniquely fit this field compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be moderate.

Because we lack specific prior probabilities and other field look likes, we make an estimate based on the alignment with personality traits from the sketch.

### Approximations:
Assumed prior \( P(H) \) for both fields is equal (neutral assumption given no specific data).

Given the alignment:

\[
P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) > P(E|\text{computer science})
\]

Hence, based on the qualitative assessment:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) > P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E)
\]

Estimated posterior probabilities:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.7
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx 0.3
\]

Final response in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These are rough estimates provided the qualitative nature of the data. For precise calculations, prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and a more detailed likelihood model would be necessary.
