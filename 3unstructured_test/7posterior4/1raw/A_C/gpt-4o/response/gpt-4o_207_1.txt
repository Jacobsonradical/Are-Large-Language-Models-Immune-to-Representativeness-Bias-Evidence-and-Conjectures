To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \).

Given Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values for the priors and the likelihoods, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Assumptions:

1. **Priors (P(H))**:
   - Let’s assume that the priors for each field indicate some general propensity of graduate students choosing these fields in a balanced way among these two options, so we’ll standardize these priors to simplify calculations:
     - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.4 \)
     - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.6 \)

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**:
   - From the description, Adam's personality traits fit quite well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science but could also potentially fit computer science due to his high intelligence and abstract thinking.
   - Based on the given traits, we’ll estimate likelihoods:
     - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)
     - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)

To find the normalizing constant \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.4 + 0.3 \cdot 0.6 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.28 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.46 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

Now we use Bayes’ rule for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.28}{0.46} \approx  0.6087 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.6}{0.46} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.46} \approx 0.3913 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6087,
  "computer science": 0.3913
}
```

These calculations reflect the probabilities based on the assumed values and the provided personality sketch.
