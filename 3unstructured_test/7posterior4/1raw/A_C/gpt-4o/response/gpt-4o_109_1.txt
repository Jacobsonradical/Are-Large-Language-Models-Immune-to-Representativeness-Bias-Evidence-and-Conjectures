To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to know a few things:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given information:

1. **Computer Science**: Typically, this field involves high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts, but neither a strong appreciation for nature nor a particular emphasis on empathy or animal care.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field involves a strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, making it highly likely that Adam's personality traits align with this field.

Let's assume some reasonable values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \):

- For **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (graduate students in general, as computer science is a popular field)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (Adam's personality does not strongly align with typical characteristics of a computer science student)

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (fewer students compared to computer science)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (Adam's personality traits strongly align with this field)

We combine these values with the normalization factor \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing \( E \). Since \( P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}}) + \text{other terms} \), but we only need relative likelihoods compared to each other, we can ignore \( P(E) \) for simplicity in this context:

- For **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06
  \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}})}{P(E)} = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
  \]

These results don't add up to 1 because we didn't normalize them. Still, the relative magnitudes can help us understand the likelihoods.

Thus, our adjusted estimation would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

Note that these values are illustrative and based on assumed probabilities. Real computation would require precise data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \).
