To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we must make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam as well as general knowledge about the fields.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Adherent to nature and plants: Fits well.
    - Strong empathy and love for animals: Very relevant.
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Important for this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - Solving puzzles: Matches well with problem-solving in computer science.
    - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: Very relevant.
    - Quiet nature: Common trait among individuals in the field but not exclusive.

Assumptions:
- Without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), let's assume them equal for simplicity.
- The evidence \( E \) related to nature, animals, and empathy is more strongly associated with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Evidence related to intelligence, problem-solving, and understanding abstract concepts can be associated with both fields but is more skewed to computer science.

Based on qualitative assessment, we can give higher weight to the congruence of personality traits with the fields.

\( P(E|H) \) assessments (qualitatively):
- For agricultural and veterinary science: High likelihood.
- For computer science: Moderate to high likelihood but lower than for the former.

If we assume equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity, we consider \( P(E|H) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note: These values are rough estimates based on the provided sketch and typical field characteristics, not precise calculations.
