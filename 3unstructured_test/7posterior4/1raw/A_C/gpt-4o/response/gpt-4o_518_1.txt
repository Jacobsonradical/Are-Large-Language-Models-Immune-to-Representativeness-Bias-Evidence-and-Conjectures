To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) under all hypotheses.

However, since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we'll have to qualitatively assess them based on the information provided.

### Hypotheses:
1. \( H_1 \) = Adam was enrolled in computer science
2. \( H_2 \) = Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):
- **Computer Science**: While Adamâ€™s high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well with a computer science student, his strong empathy, love for animals, and quiet nature might not directly correlate with typical characteristics of computer science students. Therefore, while possible, it is not highly likely based on the personality sketch alone.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. The personality sketch closely matches someone who would be interested in this field.

### Priors (\( P(H) \)):
Assuming no other information is given, we might use general enrollment data for graduate programs in the U.S., but here we will judge priors based on field popularity and size:
- Computer Science is a vastly popular and large field, so \( P(H_1) \) might be inherently high.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science might have fewer students, so \( P(H_2) \) might be relatively lower, though this is balanced by the specificity of interest.

### Posterior Probabilities (\( P(H|E) \)):
Given these qualitative assessments, the likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \) for Computer Science is lower compared to \( P(E|H_2) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's denote these probabilities in a range between 0 and 1 for simplicity:
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This means that, based on the personality sketch provided, Adam is much more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Computer Science.
