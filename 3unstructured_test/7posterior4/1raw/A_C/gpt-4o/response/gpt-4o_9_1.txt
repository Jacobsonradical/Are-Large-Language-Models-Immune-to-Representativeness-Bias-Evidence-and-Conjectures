To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis. Without specific prior probabilities for each field and exact likelihood values, we can only qualitatively assess which field Adam is more likely to be enrolled in based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Letâ€™s make some educated estimations based on the description provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - These traits are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's assume a high likelihood for these traits aligning with this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - These traits are relevant to computer science, but the direct connection to his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals is less clear. Therefore, we'll assume a moderate likelihood for these traits aligning with this field.

For simplicity, assign estimates for likelihoods based on qualitative judgment:

Let's say:

- The prior probability \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) and \( P(\text{computer science}) \) are roughly equal, given no additional information about general distribution among graduate fields.

- The likelihood \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is very high, approximately 0.9.
- The likelihood \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) is moderate, approximately 0.5.

Now, qualitatively assessing the posterior probabilities:

- P(H|E) for agricultural and veterinary science will be higher because the likelihood of traits fitting this field is higher.

Using Bayes' rule qualitatively, we get:

- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is significantly greater due to a higher match of traits.
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \) is lower because only some traits correspond to this field well.

Thus, in numerical terms (as estimates):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75, // High alignment of traits
  "computer science": 0.25 // Moderate alignment of traits
}

Remember, these provided values are estimates based on qualitative analysis due to the lack of exact priors and likelihoods.
