To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field, and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \). However, as we don't have the specific values for these probabilities, we'll make reasonable assumptions generally used in such scenarios.

Let's assume general prior distributions and assess the fit of the personality sketch to each field given the provided information.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The prior probability represents the likelihood of any student enrolling in each field without additional information. We can assume these priors to be fairly balanced for simplification.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \) (computer science) and \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.5 \) (agricultural and veterinary science).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For computer science, we need to consider Adam's personality sketch in how it fits with the field.
     - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well.
     - Empathy, love for nature, and animals are not primary traits for computer science, making it somewhat less likely.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - Empathy, love for animals, and nature, as well as appreciation for hard work, strongly align.
     - High intelligence and solving puzzles are also beneficial in this field.

Therefore, given Adam's personality sketch, we can assume that the likelihood is higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

### Approximate Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.7 \)

### Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can simplify our relative probabilities:

### Computing:
### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we can compare the numerators directly:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]

### Normalizing (Optional Step):
If we wanted them to sum to 1 for a more normalized comparison (relative probabilities), we would:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.35} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.15 + 0.35} = 0.7 \]

However, since the problem does not require normalization, we represent it as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```
