To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

- The prior probability of each hypothesis (\( P(H) \)), which reflects how probable it is for a student to be enrolled in each field without any specific information about him.
- The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)), which reflects how probable it is to observe the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
- The marginal likelihood (\( P(E) \)), which is the overall probability of the evidence and can be computed by summing up the product of prior probability and likelihood over all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, and without specific prior probabilities or detailed statistical data, we'll make some reasonable assumptions. Note that our calculations will be heuristic and relative:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This field matches his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and perhaps an appreciation for hard work and dedication. Assume the prior to be reasonably high.
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Strong fit with his interests and personality traits.

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Assume a moderate prior probability as CS is a common field of study for graduate students.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate fit given his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles; however, less directly aligned with his empathy and love for animals.

Given the values are heuristic and relative, we can make qualitative assessments as follows:

- Strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science due to alignment with nature, animal curiosity, and empathy.
- Moderate fit for computer science due to puzzle-solving interest and abstract thinking.

Given these qualitative measures:

\[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.3 \]

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity:

\[ P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.5 \]

The marginal likelihood \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Thus, using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.7 \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

So the final answers are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field based on his personality sketch.
