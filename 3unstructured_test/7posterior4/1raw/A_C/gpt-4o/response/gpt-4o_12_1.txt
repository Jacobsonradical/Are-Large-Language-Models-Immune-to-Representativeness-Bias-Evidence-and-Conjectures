Bayesian inference requires prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihoods P(E|H) for each hypothesis H. However, these are domain-specific values that aren't provided in the question. Hence, I will make plausible assumptions based on Adam's described characteristics and provide an answer accordingly.

Assumptions:
- Let P(H) be the prior probability that any student is studying a specific field.
- Let P(E|H) be the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that the student is in that field.
- The priors P(H) might be estimated based on typical enrollment statistics, but without exact data, Iâ€™ll assume equal priors for simplicity.
- The likelihoods P(E|H) will be considered based on how well the personality sketch fits typical attributes required for success in that field.

Given these assumptions:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - A love for nature, plants, and animals directly aligns with this field.
   - High empathy, strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - These traits make the likelihood P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science quite high.

2. Computer Science:
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts match well.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles also aligns with problem-solving skills in computer science.
   - However, the specific passion for nature and animals doesn't directly contribute to this field, possibly making the likelihood P(E|H) slightly lower compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's denote P(H) = 0.5 for each field independently for simplicity due to lack of detailed enrollment stats.

Now, estimating the likelihoods:
- P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science could be about 0.75 (strong match).
- P(E|H) for computer science could be about 0.30 (matches but not as strongly).

Given our priors and likelihoods,:

Posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) for normalization purposes:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75 * 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.30 * 0.5
}
```
So, the resulting approximate values would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.375,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

These values indicate higher posterior probability for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given his personality sketch.
