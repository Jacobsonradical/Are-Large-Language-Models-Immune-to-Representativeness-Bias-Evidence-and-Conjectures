Sure, to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that full information for these probabilities isn't provided, we can make reasoned estimates based on the descriptive information provided about Adam.

### Estimations:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probability for someone being in each field is roughly equal. This isn't strictly accurate but gives us a baseline without additional information:
     \[
     P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{N}
     \]
     where \( N \) represents the number of possible fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: The description includes a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts which are relevant to computer science. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature might be less central.
     \[
     P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3
     \]
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The description aligns well with this fieldâ€”curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication are strong indicators.
     \[
     P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7
     \]

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)** (normalizing constant):
   - This is harder to estimate without knowing the exhaustive list of fields and their likelihoods. For simplicity, let's assume it's uniformly distributed, which in reality is rarely the case but will help for our simple calculations.

Given these estimates, let's compute the probabilities. Since we are not calculating the exact denominator, we will compare the numerators to assess relative likelihoods:

### Computations:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E ) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E ) \propto 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{N} \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E ) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E ) \propto 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{N} \]

Comparing the numerators:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E ) \approx \frac{0.7}{N} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | E ) \approx \frac{0.3}{N} \]

The relative probabilities without knowing \( N \):
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = 0.7
\]
\[
P(\text{computer science} | E) = 0.3
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, though these estimates could be further refined with more specific prior data and likelihood assessments.
