To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the formula for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we don't have the specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will primarily rely on qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

Given Adam's personality traits:

1. A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
3. High intelligence and good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
4. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's break this down for each field:

### Computer Science
- **Interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts** can align well with computer science.
- **High intelligence** is generally beneficial for the rigorous thinking required in computer science. 
- However, **curiosity about nature** and **love for animals** are not typical indicator traits for a computer science specialization and might reduce the probability slightly.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants** is directly relevant.
- **Deep love for animals** is also highly indicative of this field.
- **Strong empathy** aligns well with the care-oriented aspects of veterinary science.
- **High intelligence** and **appreciation for hard work and dedication** are also assets in this field.

Given these qualitative considerations, we can infer that Adam's traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science.

Now we estimate the posterior probabilities based on these inferences:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This suggests that, given Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
