In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Without specific numeric data for these probabilities, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the provided descriptive information.

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- Adam's passion for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy aligns well with this field.
- Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is relatively high.
  
For "computer science":
- Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with the skills needed in computer science; however, his strong connection to nature, animals, and empathy suggests this might not be the primary field.
- Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) might be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science but still considerable.

Given these qualitative factors and assuming that prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) are equal for simplification, we can estimate the posterior probabilities subjectively.
