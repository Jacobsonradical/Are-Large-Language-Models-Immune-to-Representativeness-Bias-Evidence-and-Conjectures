To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we lack specific numerical data for the probabilities, we will make reasonable qualitative assessments based on typical characteristics associated with each field and Adam's personality sketch. This qualitative approach means that the probability values will be somewhat subjective and illustrative rather than precise.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **\( P(E|H)_{CS} \)**: The probability that a computer science student would have Adam's personality sketch might be moderate because although computer science involves abstract concepts, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work may not typically characterize a large portion of computer science students.
   - **\( P(H)_{CS} \)**: The prior probability could be relatively high because computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - **Note**: Given Adam's affinity for nature, plants, and animals, this probability might be somewhat lower.

   Based on this qualitative assessment, let's estimate:
   \[ P(H|E)_{CS} \approx 0.2 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(E|H)_{AVS} \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science is likely quite high because Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy aligns well with this field.
   - **\( P(H)_{AVS} \)**: The prior probability might be moderate to high for someone with his background, but the overall field might be less populated than computer science.

   Given these considerations:
   \[ P(H|E)_{AVS} \approx 0.7 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative judgment based on the alignment between the personality sketch and typical characteristics of the fields.
