To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start by understanding Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to precisely compute these probabilities, detailed statistical data about graduate students in various fields and how likely each of these traits fits hypothetical students in those fields is required. Since exact statistical data isn't available, we must use logical reasoning and the given personality sketch to estimate probabilities qualitatively.

### Breakdown of Terms:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field. Without additional information, we could assume these probabilities might be fairly generic.
  
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence (personality traits) given that Adam is in a specific field.
  
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence (personality traits), which can be seen as a normalizing constant.

Given that:

- Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, and he has a warm heart and empathy, these traits strongly align with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, possesses high intelligence, understands abstract concepts well, and has an appreciation for hard work, which align with computer science but less strongly compared to the specific alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences through nature and animals.

Based on the qualitative analysis, let's provide estimated values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values suggest a higher posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his specific set of personality traits, with some probability assigned to computer science based on his enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts.
