To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

However, in the absence of specific numerical values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative estimations based on the descriptions given.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can qualitatively assess the fit for each field.

### Computer Science
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align well with computer science.
- Quiet and high intelligence are traits often found in computer science students.
- Curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are not typical indicators of a computer science student.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals are strong indicators for this field.
- Strong empathy and a warm heart are valuable traits in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The subject's appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant to this field.
- Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial but are less central to agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

Considering these qualitative assessments, we might rank the likelihoods as follows, under the assumption that they are more represented among their respective fields:

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Moderate
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High

Without specific priors, we may proportionally compare these conditional probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This reflects the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and the fields in question. The "agricultural and veterinary science" field seems much more aligned with Adam's personality traits and interests compared to "computer science."
