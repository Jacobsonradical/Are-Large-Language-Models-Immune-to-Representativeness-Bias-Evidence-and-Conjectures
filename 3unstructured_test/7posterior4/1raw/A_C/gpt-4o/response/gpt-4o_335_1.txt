To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' Rule states that: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical data for the priors or the likelihoods, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

For the field of agricultural and veterinary science:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with the attributes needed in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H_\text{ag}) \) is high.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is more common than some niche fields but less common than computer science in graduate studies. We'll consider it moderate.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the same for all hypotheses and does not affect the relative comparison.

### Computer Science

For the field of computer science:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Some aspects of Adam's personality such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science. However, his love for animals and nature doesn't directly align with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_\text{cs}) \) might be moderate.
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a very common field for graduate studies, so \( P(H_\text{cs}) \) is high.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This remains consistent.

Given these qualitative assessments, and considering that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing factor that applies to both:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science:} & \\ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) & \approx \text{High Likelihood} \times \text{Moderate Prior} \\
\text{Computer Science:} & \\ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) & \approx \text{Moderate Likelihood} \times \text{High Prior}
\end{align*}
\]

Based on these evaluations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.65
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science due to a stronger alignment with his attributes and interests, although computer science also remains relatively probable due to the alignment with some of his cognitive traits and the high prior in graduate enrollment.
