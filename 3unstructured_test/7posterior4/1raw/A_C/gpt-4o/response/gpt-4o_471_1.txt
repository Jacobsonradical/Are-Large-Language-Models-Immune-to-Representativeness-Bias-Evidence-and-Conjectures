To provide the posterior probabilities \( \text{P(H|E)} \) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we need to use Bayes' Rule. However, keep in mind that the values given here are estimations based on the qualitative description \( E \) and typical characteristics associated with each field. Additionally, without specific prior probabilities, the estimates may have some inherent subjectivity.

Bayes' Rule is stated as:
\[ \text{P(H|E)} = \frac{\text{P(E|H)} \cdot \text{P(H)}}{\text{P(E)}} \]

Assumptions (based on typical profiles):
1. \(\text{P(E|H)}\):
    - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \( \text{P(E|H)} \) is high because Adam shows strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
    - For Computer Science, \( \text{P(E|H)} \) could be moderate because Adam enjoys solving puzzles, is of high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

2. \(\text{P(H)}\):
    - We assume that the prior probabilities of Adam being in either field are roughly equal for simplicity, though in the real world these would need statistical data.

3. \(\text{P(E)}\):
    - This represents the normalization constant and ensures that we technically need to account for all possible graduate fields \( H \), but for practical purposes of estimation, we'll focus on the given fields.

With these assumptions and considerations:

\[ \text{P(E|H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science})} \approx 0.7 \]
\[ \text{P(E|H = \text{computer science})} \approx 0.4 \]

Since we assume \(\text{P(H)}\) to be equal prior, we can disregard this in the relative comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

Remember these values are subjective estimates developed from the qualitative profile of Adam and typical correlates of each field.
