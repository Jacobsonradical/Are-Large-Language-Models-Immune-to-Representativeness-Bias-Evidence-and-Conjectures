To calculate the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities for each hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. However, the problem doesn't specify these prior probabilities or likelihood values explicitly. So, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on common intuition and the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
- Prior probabilities are assumed equal for simplicity.
- Likelihoods are inferred based on the personality sketch.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're assuming equal prior probabilities and focusing on the intuition from the personality sketch, we will approximate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

#### Computer Science:
- Interest in puzzles correlates somewhat with computer science.
- Abstract thinking is important in computer science.
  
However, the strong empathy and love for animals have more direct relevance to other fields.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants fits well.
- Empathy and love for animals are directly relevant.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well.

Based on these considerations, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is higher for agricultural and veterinary science than for computer science.

### Calculations:
Since explicit probabilities are not given, we can denote relative likelihoods:
Let \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = \alpha \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = \beta \) where \( \alpha > \beta \).

If we assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.7 \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.3 \),

Normalize these relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.3 \]

These are relative, not absolute probabilities.

### Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are approximations based on the given information and reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods. If more specific data were available, the calculations would be more precise.
