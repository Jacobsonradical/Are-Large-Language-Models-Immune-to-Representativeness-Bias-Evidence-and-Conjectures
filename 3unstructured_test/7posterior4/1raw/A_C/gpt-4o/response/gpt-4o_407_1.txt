To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need both the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)) and the prior probabilities of each hypothesis (\( P(H) \)).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( E \) denotes the evidence (Adam's personality sketch), and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which can be considered a normalizing constant. 

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we have to make qualitative assessments based on the given information:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \):** 
   - Adam is described as having high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science.
   - However, Adam also has a deep love for animals and nature, which is less directly relevant but doesn't completely rule out computer science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and deep love for animals strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - His warm heart and strong empathy also fit well with this field.

Given these qualitative likelihood assessments, let's assume priors are uniform because we don't have explicit prior probabilities for Adam pursuing each field. Therefore, the posterior will be mostly influenced by these likelihoods.

Thus, based on the above assessments:

- We estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) to be moderately high due to the abstract thinking part but not as compelling as the veterinary sciences.
- We estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) to be very high given his consistent interest in nature, plants, and animals.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity:
\[ \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})} < 1 \]

Here's a reasonable qualitative assessment:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
These values indicate that, while there is still a decent probability Adam might be a computer science student given his abstract thinking skills, the likelihood is higher that he is in agricultural and veterinary science due to his pronounced interest and empathy towards nature and animals.
