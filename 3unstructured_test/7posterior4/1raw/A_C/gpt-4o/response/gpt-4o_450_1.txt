To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having such a personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of such a personality sketch.

Since we do not have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can only reason qualitatively based on the given information.

1. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch mentions a high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. However, the personality traits related to nature, animals, and empathy are not strongly aligned with computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a relatively common graduate field.
   - Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) might be influenced positively by intelligence and abstract thinking but is less likely due to the empathy and natural curiosity towards animals and nature.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch is strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \): This field is less common compared to computer science but is highly relevant to the personality traits.
   - Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is likely to be higher due to the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits with this field.

Given the qualitative nature of this reasoning, let's assign probabilities that reflect these considerations.
