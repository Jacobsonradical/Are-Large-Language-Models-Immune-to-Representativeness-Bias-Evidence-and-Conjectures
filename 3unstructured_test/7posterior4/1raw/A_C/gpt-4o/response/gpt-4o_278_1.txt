Given the personality sketch E of Adam and using Bayes' Rule, we need to compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), we must make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

### Assumptions based on personality traits:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are supportive of success in computer science.
   - Enjoying solving puzzles aligns with problem-solving in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals are directly relevant.
   - Strong empathy and a warm heart are beneficial in veterinary sciences.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns with the demands of agricultural and veterinary fields.

### Assumptions of prior probabilities:
- Let’s assume a generic distribution. Without specific information, let’s assume both fields have an equal prior probability of 0.5 for simplicity.

### Assumptions of likelihoods:
- Given the personality sketch, it is clear that the personality traits are more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science. For simplicity, even if doubly aligned with one field:
  - \(P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.8\)
  - \(P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) = 0.4\)

### Posterior Probabilities:
Given the rough estimates, we can calculate relative scales.

**For Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

The term \(P(E)\) cancels out as a normalizing constant and by comparing the relative scale of posterior probabilities. 

Thus, the relative posterior probabilities are:
- P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) proportional to `0.2`.
- P(H_{\text{AgVet}} | E) proportional to `0.4`.

### Normalization:
\[
\text{Sum} = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6
\]
Thus, normalized:
- Computer Science: \(\frac{0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.333\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \(\frac{0.4}{0.6} \approx 0.666\)
