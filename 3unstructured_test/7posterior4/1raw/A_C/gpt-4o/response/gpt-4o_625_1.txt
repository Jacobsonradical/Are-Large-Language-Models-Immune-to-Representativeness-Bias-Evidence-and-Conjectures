To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to determine the relevant components:

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence E given that hypothesis H is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence E under all possible hypotheses.

We don't have actual numerical values for these components, but we can consider the qualitative aspects of the information provided.

### Estimation of \( P(E|H) \):
1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are strong indicators.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles is moderately aligned.
   - Love for nature and empathy is less directly relevant.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants is highly relevant.
   - Love for animals is a very strong indicator.
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work are strongly aligned.
   - High intelligence and abstract understanding are beneficial but less specific indicators.

### Estimation of \( P(H) \):
- The field distribution across graduate students in the U.S. tends to have a higher proportion in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Estimation of \( P(E) \):
- Since P(E) is constant across hypotheses, it cancels out in direct comparisons between fields.

### Ratios Based on Likelihood Ratios and Prior Ratios:
Given these qualitative considerations, we might estimate the likelihoods and priors as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

This is based on the fit of the personality sketch to the fields, albeit the prior spread of graduate fields suggests computer science's higher general enrollment.

However, without concrete numbers, these remain qualitative assignments.

We can summarize:
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
