To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not only the provided personality sketch (E) but also the prior probabilities of students enrolling in each field. Without specific prior probabilities, we can focus on the likelihood of Adam's traits fitting each field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the initial probability of the hypothesis).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability (the total probability of the evidence).

Given that we do not have specific values for \( P(H) \) or \( P(E) \), we will not be able to calculate the exact numerical values. However, we can estimate the relative likelihoods based on the fit of Adam's personality traits to each field.

### Computer Science
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: fits well.
- Enjoying solving puzzles: fits well.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: neutral, less relevant.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals: slightly less relevant but not exclusive.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: fits well.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants: fits very well.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals: fits extremely well.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: fits well.
- Enjoying solving puzzles: neutral, less relevant.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication: fits very well.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Adam's personality traits appear to fit more directly with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

### Estimated Probabilities

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,  // higher fit due to abstract thinking and problem-solving but lacks a direct connection to nature and animals
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // highest fit considering his curiosity in nature, love for animals, and empathy
}
```

Note: These values are estimates reflecting the stronger alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science as compared to computer science. The exact values may vary with precise prior probabilities, which are not provided in this scenario.
