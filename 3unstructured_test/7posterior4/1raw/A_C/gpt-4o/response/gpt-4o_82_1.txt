To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we would need several pieces of information that are not fully available in the given text, such as prior probabilities (i.e., the baseline probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in a certain field) and likelihoods (i.e., the probability that a student in a certain field would have the described personality traits).

However, based on the given information about Adam's personality and the fields in question, one could make some educated estimates assuming certain reasonable priors and likelihoods. For instance:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Let's reasonably assume that the number of students in fields like computer science is significantly high given the general interest and job prospects.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science might have fewer students compared to computer science, but Adam's personality traits seem to align well with this field.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The probability that a computer science student exhibits a strong love for nature, animals, and a deep empathy might be lower compared to someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

While this would just be a heuristic/qualitative assessment without exact numbers, we can provide an educated guess for the purposes of this question.

Given Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity:
- Let’s assume \(P(E)\) is constant across fields.
- Assume \(P(H)\) for fields (prior probabilities) roughly reflects the relative number of students:
  - \(P(H_\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5\)
  - \(P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.1\)

- Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) based on the described personality traits:
  - \(P(E|H_\text{computer science})\) could be relatively lower: \(\approx 0.2\)
  - \(P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\) could be relatively higher: \(\approx 0.8\)

To normalize so that we don’t need \(P(E)\):
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

To convert these to probabilities:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.08} \approx 0.56 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.1 + 0.08} \approx 0.44 \]

So, without actual priors and with the given assumptions:

{
  "computer science": 0.56,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
