To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the likelihood of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H, the prior probability of H, and the overall probability of the personality sketch E across all fields. Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Given that prior information such as base rates for each field of study, specific likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability \( P(E) \) are not specified, the detailed calculation will be simplified by intuition and reasoning based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - While Adam has high intelligence and a knack for solving puzzles, which fits a Computer Science profile, interests such as a deep love for animals and empathy are not typically emphasized in this field.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, appreciation for plants, strong empathy, and love for animals align closely with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given these considerations and without the exact numerical priors and likelihoods, we will intuitively evaluate the probabilities.

  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

To further refine these probabilities, additional data and a more detailed Bayesian framework would be necessary.
