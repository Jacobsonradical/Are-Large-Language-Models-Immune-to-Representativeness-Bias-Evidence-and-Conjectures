To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{AV} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( E \) as the given personality sketch of Adam.

We will need to estimate several probabilities for this calculation:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam studies computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam studies agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_{AV}) \): Prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

### Estimations

1. **\( P(E|H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E|H_{AV}) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: While Adam's traits such as high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, as well as empathy and love for animals, are less typical for the field.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits very well with this field.

   Therefore, we might estimate:
   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8 \]

2. **\( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{AV}) \)**:
   - Graduate students in the U.S. are more commonly enrolled in computer science than in agricultural and veterinary science.
   
   Let's assume:
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]
   \[ P(H_{AV}) = 0.1 \]

3. **\( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the normalization factor, the probability of observing Adam's traits across all possible fields of study.
   - Given the provided hypotheses and expected values:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + \text{other fields} \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + \text{other fields} \]

Assuming "other fields" contributes a significant but comparable amount, we simplified our calculations for clarity:

### Calculation:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Let's approximate:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.08 + \text{other fields} \approx 0.14 \]

So, 

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore,

{
  "computer science": 0.429,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571
}
