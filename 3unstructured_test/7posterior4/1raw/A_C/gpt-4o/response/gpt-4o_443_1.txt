To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each given field using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack certain specific pieces of data to make exact calculations, such as:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality given he is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Instead, I'll provide a qualitative estimate based on how well Adam's personality and interests match the typical characteristics and requirements of each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Interest in nature and plants:** Very relevant.
- **Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals:** Extremely relevant.
- **High intelligence and abstract thinking:** Useful in research and complex problem-solving.
- **Understanding and appreciation for hard work:** Highly relevant.

Given this alignment, it is very likely Adam could be enrolled in an agricultural or veterinary science program.

### Computer Science
- **Enjoys solving puzzles:** A strong match for problem-solving in computer science.
- **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Very applicable to theoretical aspects of computer science.
- **Quiet disposition:** Neutral.
- **Interest in nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals:** Less directly relevant but doesn't preclude involvement in certain areas of computer science such as bioinformatics, environmental modeling, or AI in conservation.

Given this, it is plausible but less compelling than the previous field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect the higher relevance and match of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science while considering both fields are plausible.
