To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally require more information, such as prior probabilities and likelihoods that map the description provided in E to the hypotheses in question. However, in the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we will give a qualitative assessment based on the personality traits described in E:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. He also has a high appreciation for hard work and dedication, all of which strongly align with characteristics often found in students specializing in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which aligns with traits commonly necessary for success in computer science. However, there is less direct mention of technology-related interests in the given sketch.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Again, note that these values are estimates based on the qualitative match of Adam's description with typical characteristics of students in these fields. In reality, specific priors and likelihood estimations would be necessary for precise Bayesian computation.
