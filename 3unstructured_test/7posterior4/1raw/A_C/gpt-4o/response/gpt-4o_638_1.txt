To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know three things for each field (H):

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):** Probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Evidence (P(E)):** Overall probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit data for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods from empirical studies or data, we will need to make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Let's use reasonable estimates for the prior probabilities and likelihoods:

### Prior Probabilities
- **P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** Assume a lower prior probability because fewer students might be in this field.
- **P(Computer Science):** Higher prior probability due to the field's popularity and demand.

### Likelihoods
- **P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** High likelihood because Adam's traits strongly align with this field.
- **P(E|Computer Science):** Moderate likelihood because although solving puzzles and abstract thinking align well, other traits are less relevant.

Based on these assumptions, let's provide rough estimates based on these intuitive judgments.

### Estimates

#### Prior Probabilities:
- P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) ≈ 0.1
- P(Computer Science) ≈ 0.4

#### Likelihoods:
- P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) ≈ 0.8
- P(E|Computer Science) ≈ 0.5

### Evidence (P(E)):
P(E) can be considered as the sum of weighted likelihoods across all fields, but we'll simplify and not compute it explicitly. Instead, focusing on the ratio will suffice as we're comparing relative plausibilities.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Computing the posterior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(AH|E) = \frac{P(E|AH) \cdot P(AH)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(AH|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Computing the posterior for Computer Science:
\[ P(CH|E) = \frac{P(E|CH) \cdot P(CH)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(CH|E) \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} \]

We're interested in relative probabilities (proportional rather than exact values as P(E) cancels out when comparing them):

\[ P(AH|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(CH|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.4 = 0.2 \]

To summarize in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}
```

Please note that these values are rough estimates due to the lack of concrete prior and likelihood data.
