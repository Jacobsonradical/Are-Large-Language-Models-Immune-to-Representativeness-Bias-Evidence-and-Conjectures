To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. **P(E|H)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given each hypothesis. This means how likely is Adam’s personality sketch if he is in a given field.
2. **P(H)**: This is the prior probability of each hypothesis. This involves knowing the general distribution of graduate students in each field.
3. **P(E)**: This is the probability of the evidence irrespective of the field. While we can sometimes ignore this in relative comparisons, let's assume it's the same for both fields for practical estimation.

Since we do not have exact numerical probabilities, we'll estimate relatively based on the given personality sketch.

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H-cs)**: Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking aligns well with computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals is less common in CS, which slightly diminishes this probability.
- **P(H-cs)**: Consider the general likelihood of students enrolled in computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H-agro-vet)**: Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- **P(H-agro-vet)**: Consider the general likelihood of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the information, we can reasonably assume:

- The likelihood \( P(E|H-agro-vet) \) is much higher than \( P(E|H-cs) \).
- Generally, there are fewer students in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, so \( P(H-cs) \) is likely higher than \( P(H-agro-vet) \).

Balancing these:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Given the alignment of Adam’s attributes, let’s estimate \( P(E|H-agro-vet) \) at around 0.9.

### Computer Science
The somewhat lesser alignment, but the higher proportion of CS students, provides a relatively lower likelihood, say \( P(E|H-cs) \) around 0.4.

Considering these proportional evaluations, relative posterior probabilities can be estimated:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values show that, given Adam’s personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
