To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to find:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since Bayes' rule requires the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and the general prevalence of these fields among graduate students.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Assumptions:

Let's make some assumptions for the sake of illustration:

1. **Prior Probabilities (\(P(H)\)):**
  
   These are arbitrary and illustrative, as we do not have exact data on how many graduate students are in each field.

   - Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in computer science (\( P(H_1) \)) = 0.2
   - Probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(H_2) \)) = 0.1

2. **Likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)):**

   Based on the personality sketch:
   
   - Likelihood that a student with the described personality would be in computer science (\( P(E|H_1) \)) = 0.4
   - Likelihood that a student with the described personality would be in agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(E|H_2) \)) = 0.7

3. **Marginal Probability (\(P(E)\)):**

   This is the total probability of the evidence across all possible hypotheses. Since we are interested in only these two fields, we can normalize based on the information given.

### Calculation:

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) = Computer Science
- \( H_2 \) = Agricultural and Veterinary Science

#### For Computer Science:

\[ 
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]

Similarly for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ 
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)}
\]

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

\[ 
P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.2) + (0.7 \cdot 0.1) = 0.08 + 0.07 = 0.15
\]

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.15} = \frac{0.08}{0.15} \approx 0.533
\]

\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = \frac{0.07}{0.15} \approx 0.467
\]

So, our results would be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.533,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on our assumptions. Actual probabilities may differ with more specific data.
