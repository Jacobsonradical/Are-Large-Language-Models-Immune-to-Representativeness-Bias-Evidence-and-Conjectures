To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll follow this equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of being enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality traits given that the subject is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant (total probability of the evidence).

Since exact prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) are not provided, we will make educated estimates.

1. **Computer Science:**

Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving align moderately with the skills required in computer science. However, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is not typically associated with computer science.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits if he were in computer science)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.25 \) (Prior probability of being enrolled in computer science)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

Adam’s strong interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and dedication also support his likelihood of being in this field.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.7 \) (Likelihood of Adam's traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.15 \) (Prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science)

Next, we compute the posterior probabilities assuming a simplified normalization constant. Note that for simplicity and given the lack of full data, we will ignore the exact computation of \( P(E) \) but recognize it would affect both probabilities equally.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Given these rough estimates:

{
  "computer science": \(\frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)}\approx \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \approx 0.05\) (scaled estimate)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.105}{P(E)} \approx 0.30\) (scaled estimate)
}

In summary, with these assumptions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

*Note: The exact values of \( P(E) \) and thorough domain knowledge would lead to more precise computations.*
