To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). In the absence of specific prior data, we can only provide a qualitative assessment rather than precise numerical values. Using the details given in Adam's personality sketch:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
3. He is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles.
4. He is a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

Based on this information, it's more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science due to his love for nature, plants, and animals. However, his intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts suggest that he also has qualities suitable for computer science.

With this in mind, the qualitative assessment might look like:

\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // Higher probability due to interest in nature, plants, and animals.
  "computer science": 0.3  // Lower probability but still significant due to abstract thinking and problem-solving skills.
\}

These values provide a rough idea of the relative likelihoods based on the qualitative features of his personality sketch.
