To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing evidence E given hypothesis H.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis H.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing evidence E.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In the absence of explicit prior probabilities and detailed statistical data for each hypothesis, we must rely on qualitative assessment based on the sketch provided. 

Given the sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and is good at understanding abstract concepts. These traits could align with computer science but are not exclusive to it.

Assuming broad priors (i.e., \( P(H) \)) are similar for each field and given Adam's strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science, we can qualitatively assess the posterior probabilities.

Let's denote:

- \( P(\text{E}|\text{H}_\text{ag}) \) as the probability of the evidence given agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(\text{E}|\text{H}_\text{cs}) \) as the probability of the evidence given computer science.

Given the qualitative evaluation, let's estimate:

- \( P(E|\text{H}_\text{ag}) = 0.8 \) (highly consistent with traits and interests)
- \( P(E|\text{H}_\text{cs}) = 0.3 \) (partially consistent but less so)

Using these qualitative estimates, the posterior probabilities do not have a formal prior \( P(H) \) nor exact \( P(E) \) due to insufficient specific data, but the ratios can indicate comparative likelihoods.

Thus:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This answer reflects that the context supports a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science given the provided personality sketch, subject to the constraints of qualitative reasoning and the lack of specific statistical data.
