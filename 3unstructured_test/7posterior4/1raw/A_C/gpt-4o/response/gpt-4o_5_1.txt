To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

In this context:
- \( H \) could be "agricultural and veterinary science" or "computer science" as field of study.
- \( E \) is the personality sketch provided for Adam.

Without specific empirical prior and likelihood values, we'll have to make some informed estimations.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This should ideally be based on the proportion of graduate students in each field. However, since we don't have specific data, let’s consider them relatively equally probable with a slight inclination towards certain relevance given Adam’s characteristics.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how likely Adam’s personality sketch matches students in these fields.

Given Adam's profile with high empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, it's reasonable to assume a higher likelihood for "agricultural and veterinary science". For "computer science", while his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are a fit, the empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.

Here are our best estimates based on Adam’s profile:

- **"Agricultural and Veterinary Science"**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.25 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.6 \)

- **"Computer Science"**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.25 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.3 \)

- **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: As it encompasses all possible hypotheses, for our relative calculation, it can be considered as a normalizing constant.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and constant:

\[ \frac{P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E)}{P(\text{computer science}|E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.25}{0.3 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.6}{0.3} = 2 \]

So:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 2 \times P(\text{computer science}|E) \]

Normalizing to keep within [0, 1] for relative representation:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
