To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following aspects:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of being enrolled in each field without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be calculated as a sum of the product of the prior and likelihoods across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact numerical values for the priors and likelihoods are not given, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Assume that each field of study is pursued by graduate students with roughly equal probability, considering the wide array of graduate fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's highly likely he'd be in this field.
    - Computer Science: Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, it's also quite likely he'd be in this field.

### Prior Probabilities:
Let's assume \( P(H) \) to be moderately equal for both fields as there are many fields of graduate studies.

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = 0.1 \]

### Likelihoods:
Given the personality sketch, we can assume the following probabilities:

\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.6 \]

### Evidence \( P(E) \):
Since there are multiple fields that Adam could potentially be enrolled in, the total probability \( P(E) \) should consider the likelihoods across all fields. However, we'll simplify and normalize probabilities here considering the two fields under examination:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.14 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
Using Bayes' rule, we can now calculate the posterior probabilities for each field:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.571 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.429 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```

These values suggest that based on the personality sketch, Adam is slightly more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
