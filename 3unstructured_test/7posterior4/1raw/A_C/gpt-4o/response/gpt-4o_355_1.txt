Calculating the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule requires detailed prior probabilities, likelihoods, and marginal probabilities, which are not provided in the given context. However, I can qualitatively reason through the problem to provide reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Let's denote:
- P(H_agri|E) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- P(H_cs|E) as the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science given his personality sketch.

We'll use the following logic:
1. **Prior probabilities (P(H))**: The prior probabilities, or how common it is for graduate students to be in each field, influence the posterior. Assuming some rough equality, let's regard the initial priors for sensibility's sake, noting that this approach is broad and assumes no additional information.
2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**: How well Adam's characteristics match the typical characteristics of students in each field. Given the information:

   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's love of nature, plants, and animals, paired with his strong empathy, is directly aligned with those who typically choose this field. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also aligns well with the rigors of this field.
   
   - For computer science: Adam's intellectual abilities, curiosity, and problem-solving skills would be well-suited for computer science. However, a strong love for animals and nature might be less directly aligned with this field.

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, I will assign the following estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates assume that Adamâ€™s characteristics correspond more closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences due to his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, while still acknowledging that his intellectual abilities and problem-solving skills could significantly contribute to a field like computer science. Please note that these values are qualitative estimates based on the information provided and not derived from precise probabilistic calculations.
