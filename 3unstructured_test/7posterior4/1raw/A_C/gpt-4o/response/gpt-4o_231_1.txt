Bayes' rule for computing posterior probabilities is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given Adam’s personality sketch (E), we need to estimate how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in computer science or agricultural and veterinary science. Here’s a rough approximation, considering typical personality traits that match the fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Traits Matching: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, likes solving puzzles.
   - Traits Not necessarily matching: Strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Traits Matching: Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, appreciation for hard work.
   - Traits Not necessarily matching: Good at understanding abstract concepts, high intelligence.

Let's make rough qualitative assessments of the probabilities:
- \( P(E| H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \) (Computer Science shows some matching traits).
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \) (Assuming 20% chance given a broad spectrum of fields).
- \( P(E| H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.85 \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science shows strong matching traits).
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (Assuming 10% chance given a broad spectrum of fields).

Now, we need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + \text{Probability of traits matching other fields} \]

For simplicity, let's denote probability of matching traits in other fields as \( 0.6 \):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.2 + 0.85 \cdot 0.1 + 0.6 \]

Calculating it numerically:
\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.085 + 0.6 = 0.805 \]

Now we can calculate:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{0.805} \approx 0.149 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.1}{0.805} \approx 0.106 \]

Presented in the requested format:
{
  "computer science": 0.149,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.106
