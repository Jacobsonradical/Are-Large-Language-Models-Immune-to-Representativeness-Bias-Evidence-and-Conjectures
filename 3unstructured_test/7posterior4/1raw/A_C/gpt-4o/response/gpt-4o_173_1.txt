To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to have some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality traits would be observed given he is in each field. While I cannot provide exact numerical computations without specific data, I can offer a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch of Adam (E).

Given Adam's personality traits, such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and strong empathy, these characteristics align closely with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, Adamâ€™s high intelligence, abstract thinking capabilities, and enjoyment of puzzles also align with someone in the field of computer science, though less directly related to his love for nature and animals.

Based on these considerations, here is my qualitative assessment (note that these are rough estimations, and not actual probabilities):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the higher alignment of Adam's interests and traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, while still acknowledging his suitability for both fields. If more data were available (e.g., prior probabilities of students enrolling in each field, or more specific traits and behaviors indicative of each field), more accurate calculations could be provided.
