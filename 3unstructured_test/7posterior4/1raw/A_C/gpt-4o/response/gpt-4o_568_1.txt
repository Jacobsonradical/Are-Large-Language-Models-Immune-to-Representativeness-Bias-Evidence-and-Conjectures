To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule**: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

2. **Define the terms**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific values for the priors and likelihoods, we will make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge. Here's the breakdown:

### Hypothesis: Computer Science
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): The evidence \( E \) depicts Adam as a person who enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence. These traits are common in computer science students, so we assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is relatively high.
- **P(H)** (Prior): Computer science programs are quite common, so the prior \( P(H_{CS}) \) might be moderate.
- **P(E)** (Marginal): This is the same for both hypotheses but is unknown and not needed for a direct comparison.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)** (Likelihood): The evidence \( E \) shows a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, fitting well with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) could be also high.
- **P(H)** (Prior): Agricultural and veterinary science programs are less common compared to computer science, so the prior \( P(H_{AVS}) \) might be lower.

### Relative Probabilities
Without exact values, we rely on relative fitting scores:
- Computer Science: High intelligence and puzzle-solving fit well.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Empathy and love for nature and animals fit very well.

Since both fields match well on different aspects, we make an educated guess (without precise computation):

### Guessing Probabilities
- **Computer Science**: Due to puzzle-solving and abstract concepts - but balancing its higher program frequency.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Due to empathy, nature, animals - but balancing its lower program frequency.

Using Bayes' rule in an approximate manner:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are reasoned estimates. For precise computation, one would need actual prior and likelihood values.
