To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality traits given each hypothesis of enrollment in a specific field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the personality traits across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't have actual statistical data for the priors and likelihoods, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **P(E | H)**: Given the personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, it is reasonable to assume a high likelihood for an agricultural and veterinary science student.
- **P(H)**: This prior probability can vary, but let's assume the likelihood of a graduate student being in this field is moderately low compared to more common fields like computer science.
- **P(E)**: Since we are only dealing with two fields here, we can simplify our calculation without losing the essence of the problem.

2. **Computer Science**

- **P(E | H)**: Although Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, not all personality traits align well with this field (e.g., love for animals).
- **P(H)**: This prior probability is higher than agricultural and veterinary science, given the prevalence of computer science students.
- **P(E)**: Same as above, we consider this in our simplified comparison.

Based on the above qualitative reasoning, here are estimated values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science, although computer science can't be completely ruled out given his intelligence and skills in abstract thinking.
