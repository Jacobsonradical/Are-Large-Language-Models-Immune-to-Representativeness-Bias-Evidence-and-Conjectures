To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider both the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) and the prior probability of \( H \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume the following:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \): Total probability of the evidence (which acts as a normalization constant).

For this calculation, we will assume some reasonable values based on the given personality sketch and general distribution of graduate fields. Since exact statistical data is not provided, these values will be selected based on logical assumptions.

### For Computer Science:
- It can be assumed that Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science.
- However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature may not be directly relevant or as strong an indicator for this field.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature strongly suggest a fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also relevant here.

Let's assume some logical priors and likelihoods:

- Prior probability (\( P(H) \)):
  - Computer science: 0.4 (fairly popular and diverse field)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2 (less common than some other fields)

- Likelihood of the evidence (\( P(E|H) \)):
  - Computer Science:
    - Multi-faceted interests, but less alignment with empathy and love for animals: 0.3
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
    - Direct alignment with most of the personality traits: 0.7

We normalize by using a constant \( P(E) \), which we can ignore for comparing different \( P(H|E) \).

### Calculation:

1. For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{P(E)} = 0.12 / P(E) \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{AVS}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = 0.14 / P(E) \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, we can focus on the relative strengths of these values:

{
  "computer science": 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.14) ≈ 0.462,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14 / (0.12 + 0.14) ≈ 0.538
}

So the posterior probabilities, given our assumptions and inputs, are approximately:

{
  "computer science": "0.46",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.54"
}
