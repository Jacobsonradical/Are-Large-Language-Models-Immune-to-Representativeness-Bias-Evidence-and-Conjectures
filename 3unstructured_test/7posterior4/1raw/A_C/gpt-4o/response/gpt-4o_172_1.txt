Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities for each field (P(H)) and the likelihoods (P(E|H)), we can't compute exact numerical values for the posterior probability. Instead, I can provide a qualitative analysis based on the personality sketch provided.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are more closely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts might be considered more typical for computer science, though it's not specific to it.

Given these considerations, an informed guess for the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field can be made:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This interpretation indicates a higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his interest in nature, animals, and hard work. Meanwhile, the likelihood of computer science is also considerable due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, but somewhat lower because it doesn't align as directly with his stated interests and personality traits.
