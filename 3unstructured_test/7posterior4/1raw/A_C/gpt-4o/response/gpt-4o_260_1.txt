To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

### Computer Science
- Traits: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
- These traits are often associated with individuals in computer science.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Traits: Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong heart and empathy, appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- These traits align closely with this field.

Given the above qualitative reasoning, let's estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

This suggests that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch.
