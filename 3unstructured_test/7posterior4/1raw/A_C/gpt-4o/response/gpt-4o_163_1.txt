To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given his field of study and the prior probabilities of those fields. However, we'll need to make some assumptions since we don't have specific numerical information. 

First, let's denote:
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given his field.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) as the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of the sketch, we can qualitively compare how well Adam's characteristics align with each field. 

### Computer Science
- Strong intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are highly relevant.
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles is a good fit.
- Genuine curiosity and warmth are not irrelevant but not primary traits for this field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants aligns very well.
- Strong empathy and love for animals are highly relevant.
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work fits.

To rough in an estimate based on this, let's assign some hypothetical values. These are just illustrative and not based on actual data:

- Assume the prior \( P(H) \) for all graduate students being in computer science is 0.3 and in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1.
- Based on personality traits:
  - \( P(E|H) \) for computer science might be 0.4.
  - \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science might be 0.7.
- \( P(E) \) could be approximated as a normalization factor, but for comparison's sake, we're interested in the relative probabilities.

Using these numbers:

\[ P(H=CS|E) = \frac{P(E|H=CS) \cdot P(H=CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H=AgVet|E) = \frac{P(E|H=AgVet) \cdot P(H=AgVet)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common normalization factor, we can compare relative values without calculating it explicitly:

- For computer science:
\[ P(H=CS|E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H=AgVet|E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

They do not need to sum to 1 because there are other possible fields. Reporting these relative probabilities:

  "computer science": 0.12,
