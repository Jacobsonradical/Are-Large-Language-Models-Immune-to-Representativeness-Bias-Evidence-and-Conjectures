To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and typical profiles of students in each field. This will allow us to estimate plausible values for these probabilities.

### Analysis:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Students in computer science are often very intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which matches some aspects of Adam’s personality, but they are not particularly known for their love of nature and animals.
  - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular graduate field, so the prior probability is relatively high.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Students in this field are very likely to have a deep love for animals and a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, which closely matches Adam’s personality.
  - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than computer science, so the prior probability might be lower.

Considering these qualitative insights, we can infer that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should be much higher for agricultural and veterinary science than for computer science, given Adam's profile.

### Estimation:

We will assume the following likely qualitative values based on the descriptions:
- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate (e.g., 0.3)
  - \( P(H) \): Higher prior (e.g., 0.3)
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): High (e.g., 0.8)
  - \( P(H) \): Lower prior (e.g., 0.1)

Let's assume \( P(E) \) is approximately the same for both fields for simplicity.

Using these qualitative approximations, we can estimate:
- For Computer Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)}
  \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
  \]

These values need to be normalized, but for simplicity, we look at the ratios:

\[
P(H|E) \text{ (Computer Science)} \approx \frac{0.09}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \text{ (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]

Given that these are rough estimates, we can see they are fairly close, but with the described personality, Adam might be slightly more likely in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to the stronger alignment of the personality traits.

Final estimates in numerical form for easier representation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These are qualitative estimations reflecting that Adam's personality sketch fits slightly better with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science.
