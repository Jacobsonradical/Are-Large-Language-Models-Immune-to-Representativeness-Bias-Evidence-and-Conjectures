To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the observed personality traits given that he is in each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since the exact distributions are not provided, we will make informed estimates based on the typical characteristics and interests aligned with each field. We will assume some reasonable priors and likelihoods based on qualitative judgment.

Here is an estimation:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathetic nature, it is plausible that he might be enrolled in this field. We consider a moderate to high prior and a high likelihood.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (as the field might be less commonly chosen relative to others like computer science).
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood given Adam’s interests).

- **Computer Science**: Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, the other traits related to nature, animals, and empathy might be less aligned with this field. We consider a higher prior for this field overall but a lower likelihood given the specific traits.
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (a relatively common field for high intelligence).
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (lower likelihood based on Adam’s specific traits).

Let's normalize these to get reasonable posterior probabilities considering these qualitative assumptions. Since precise numerics are not provided, we'll use these estimations directly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.15
}

These values are subjective and should ideally be refined with more data, but they are reasonable given the current assumptions.
