To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch (marginal probability).

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make some educated assumptions based on the description of Adam and the general characteristics of the fields.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
    - Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field is relatively even since we don't have specific prior information. 
    - For simplicity, we can assume \( P(H) \) for both fields (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science) is the same. 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - We need to gauge how well Adam's personality aligns with each field.
   - Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and plants, and his quiet, empathetic nature, it aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could align with computer science, but his strong appreciation for nature and animals seems less connected.

Comparative alignment:
\[
P(E|H_{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) \gg P(E|H_{computer\_science})
\]

By these assumptions:

**In simplistic terms, without exact numerical data:**

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This assumes that the combination of Adam's personality traits aligns significantly better with agricultural and veterinary sciences than with computer science based on the provided personality sketch.
