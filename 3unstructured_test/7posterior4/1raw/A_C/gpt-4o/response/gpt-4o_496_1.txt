To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume that we can estimate \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis) and \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of the hypothesis).

### Computer Science

1. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: For someone in computer science, having a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a good understanding of abstract concepts may be less likely but still possible.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **P(H) for Computer Science**: Graduate programs in computer science are quite common.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \), as computer science is a popular field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's traits align well with interests in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy).
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \).

2. **P(H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than in computer science, but not extremely rare.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \).

### P(E)

Since \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, we can estimate it considering the combined support from different fields. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.25 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.25} = 0.24
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.25} = 0.32
  \]

Thus, our results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.24,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32
}
