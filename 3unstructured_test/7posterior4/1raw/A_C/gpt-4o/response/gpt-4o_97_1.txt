To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field before considering his personality sketch \( E \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.

3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions about the relative priors and likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a less common field compared to computer science, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.2 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, it is highly likely that he would be in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.8 \).

### Computer Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very common field for graduate students, so let's assume \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.8 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adamâ€™s intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science, the traits related to nature and animals are less relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \).

### Evidence \( P(E) \)

To simplify, we'll assume that the evidence \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor.

Using these assumptions, we calculate for each field:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.8}{P(E)} \]

The final probabilities will be proportional to these calculations, with the normalization factor ensuring that they sum to 1 across all possible fields.

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, we can compare the numerators directly:

\[
\frac{P(H_{\text{agri}} | E)}{P(H_{\text{cs}} | E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.3 \cdot 0.8} = \frac{0.16}{0.24} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So the ratio of \( P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) \) to \( P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

To convert these to a format where they don't necessarily sum to 1 but reflect the relative belief based on our assumptions:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) = \frac{2}{5} \approx 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}} | E) = \frac{3}{5} \approx 0.6 \]

Thus, the final answers would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

Keep in mind that these are reasonable assumptions and the actual values might differ based on more precise prior data.
