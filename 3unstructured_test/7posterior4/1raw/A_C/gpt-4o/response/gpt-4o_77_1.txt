To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Here is Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, the calculations will be qualitative. Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.

### Prior Probabilities
Assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) are based on the distribution of graduate students across these fields in 2021.

### Likelihood
- \( P(E|H_1) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science is high because of his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): There is also a high likelihood that he might be in computer science due to his intelligence, abstract thinking, and love of solving puzzles.

### Evidence
- \( P(E) \): This is the same for both hypotheses and acts as a normalizing constant.

Given Adam's characteristics, we qualitatively assess the likelihoods:

- For agricultural and veterinary science: High due to several matching traits.
- For computer science: Moderate to high due to intelligence and abstract thinking but a little less aligned with the empathy and love for animals.

Considering these factors qualitatively, we can estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values represent the relative strengths of the posterior probabilities given the personality sketch and the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods. The actual values can be more accurate with specific data on graduate enrollments and detailed probabilities.
