To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, which is what we want to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have specific numeric prior probabilities and likelihoods, and because precise numerical calculation of prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for different fields would require detailed statistical data, we will make qualitative estimations based on Adam's personality sketch.

**Agricultural and veterinary science:**
1. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
2. Prior probability \( P(H) \): This field is less frequently chosen compared to others like computer science, so the prior probability might be lower.

**Computer science:**
1. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): While Adam is described as having high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are important for computer science, his specific love for nature and animals and empathy don't directly align with this field. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to low.
2. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The field of computer science has a higher enrollment rate, giving a higher prior probability.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize the posterior probabilities qualitatively, rather than calculating specific numbers due to lack of exact data.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 (high due to strong alignment with personal interests),
  "computer science": 0.3 (considerable due to abstract thinking skills, but lower alignment with specific interests)
}

These values are only indicative based on the given personality sketch and general trends in enrollment fields. They are not precise calculations but rather qualitative assessments.
