To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields given, we need to have some prior probability estimates \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given each field. Since we do not have those priors or likelihoods explicitly, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.

Given these points, we can qualitatively assess which field is more likely. From the sketch, Adam's characteristics seem to align more closely with interests pertinent to agricultural and veterinary science than to computer science, although his intelligence and problem-solving skills could fit either field.

To provide numerical estimates, we'll assume conservative, illustrative values:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field can be assumed to be \( 1/50 \) as there are many possible graduate fields (this is an arbitrary assumption due to lack of explicit prior data). Let's assume equal priors for these purposes:

  \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 1/50 \)
  
  \( P(\text{computer science}) = 1/50 \)

- Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

  Given the personality traits and interests,
  \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is assumed to be high, perhaps around 0.8.
  \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) is assumed to be moderate, perhaps around 0.4.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant, let's compute unnormalized posterior probabilities:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \propto P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ \propto 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{50} \]
\[ = 0.016 \]

- For computer science:
\[ P(H| \text{computer science}) \propto P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ \propto 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{50} \]
\[ = 0.008 \]

Since we are just comparing these to get relative probabilities, normalization is not needed here.

Therefore,
\[ \frac{P(H| \text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(H| \text{computer science})} = \frac{0.016}{0.008} = 2 \]

So, we can estimate that Adam is roughly twice as likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.

Let's represent these unnormalized values directly:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.016,
  "computer science": 0.008
}
```

Please note these values are only illustrative and based on reasonable assumptions given the information available.
