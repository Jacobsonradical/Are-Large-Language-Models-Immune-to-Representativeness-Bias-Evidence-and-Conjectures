To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with the general formulation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \), we'll instead qualitatively assess the probabilities based on the given personality sketch and some reasonable assumptions.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam has traits like high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits align well with the field of computer science, suggesting a moderate to high likelihood.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field of study, so the prior probability might be relatively high.
   - **Result**: Based on the above, the posterior probability is moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, along with a deep love for animals, strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. This suggests a very high likelihood.
   - **P(H)**: This field might have a lower prior probability compared to computer science since fewer students might choose this field.
   - **Result**: Despite the lower prior, the high \( P(E|H) \) pushes the posterior probability higher.

Considering these qualitative evaluations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood based on the alignment of personality traits with the fields and the typical prior probabilities of these fields, though exact numerical precision isn't possible without further data.
