Sure! To determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \).

To actually compute these values, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors. Since these detailed statistics are not given, we'll make qualitative estimates.

Let's estimate these qualitatively:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s traits related to curiosity, problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit reasonably well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a common graduate field, so we may consider it to be fairly probable.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work fit this field quite well.
   - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than Computer Science but still a valid field.  

Here is a qualitative estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

These estimates suggest that given Adam’s personality sketch, it is somewhat more likely that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his deep love for nature and animals but also quite plausible that he could be in Computer Science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence.
