To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability of Adam being in each field \( P(H) \), and the overall likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics across all fields \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact numerical values for these probabilities, we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided descriptions.

Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \): Prior probabilities for Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given each field.

Based on the description, Adam has a stronger natural inclination towards fields related to nature, plants, and animals, which suggests a higher likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.

Let's assume some plausible estimates:
1. Prior probability for both fields:
   - Computer Science: \( P(H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.4 \)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \approx 0.1 \)

2. Likelihood of Adam's characteristics given each field:
   - For Computer Science: \( P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \approx 0.2 \) (high intelligence and puzzle solving are relevant, but not the nature and animal aspects)
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \approx 0.7 \) (strong match with nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work)

3. Overall likelihood \( P(E) \) is the weighted sum of the likelihoods over all possible fields, approximated for simplicity here.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{AVS}}}{P(E)} \]

Approximating \( P(E) \) as the sum for these two fields:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H)_{\text{CS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{CS}} + P(E|H)_{\text{AVS}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{AVS}} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.4 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 + 0.07 = 0.15 \]

Now, compute each posterior probability:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.4}{0.15} = \frac{0.08}{0.15} \approx 0.533 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = \frac{0.07}{0.15} \approx 0.467 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.533,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
```

Keep in mind these values are based on assumptions and illustrative estimates. In practice, more precise data and a broader set of hypotheses would refine these probabilities.
