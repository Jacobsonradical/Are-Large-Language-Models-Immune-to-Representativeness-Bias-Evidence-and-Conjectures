To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are assumed to be equal, we can focus on the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - *Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)*: Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and hard work all align well with this field.
   
2. **Computer Science**
   - *Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)*: Adam's high intelligence, ability to solve puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science, though his specific interest in nature and animals is less aligned with this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign approximate likelihood values.

Assuming:
- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high, say 0.8 
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is moderate, say 0.3

Next, we normalize these probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8}{0.8 + 0.3} = \frac{0.8}{1.1} \approx 0.727 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3}{0.8 + 0.3} = \frac{0.3}{1.1} \approx 0.273 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
