To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science," we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's total probability.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, let's reason through the problem qualitatively.

Given Adam's personality:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High. Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals fit well with this field.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This would depend on how common it is for students to be in this field, but let's assume it's moderately common among graduate students.
- **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Given the alignment of Adam's traits with the field, it should be relatively high.

### Computer Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are important traits for computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less relevant here.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a very common field for graduate students.
- **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: While the enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns, the other traits are less relevant.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These are not exact values but should provide a rough indication based on the given personality sketch.
