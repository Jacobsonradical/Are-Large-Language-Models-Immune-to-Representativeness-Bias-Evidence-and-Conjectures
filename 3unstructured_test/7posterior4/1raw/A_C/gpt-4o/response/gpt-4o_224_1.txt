Using Bayes' rule, we can compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), which quantifies the probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given the information provided, we need to make educated assumptions about the values of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) based on qualitative analysis since quantitative data is not explicitly given.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals and strong empathy, which aligns well with veterinary science.
- Appreciates the hard work and dedication required in agricultural and veterinary disciplines.

### Computer Science
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles, indicating strong problem-solving skills.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, aligning well with the cognitive rigor of computer science.

### Assumptions
- \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses compared, so it will cancel out in relative comparisons.
- \( P(H) \): Assume default priors are equal if not otherwise specified.

Given these considerations, we can make educated guesses:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(E|H) \): High, since many aspects such as love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation of hard work align well.
- \( P(H) \): Reasonable, given the relevance to his interests.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, since problem-solving and abstract thinking align, but other personality aspects (like love for nature and animals) do not directly correlate.
- \( P(H) \): Reasonable, given the general interest in cognitive challenges.

### Calculations (Qualitative Analysis):
\[
P(\text{Agri & Vet Sci}|E) \approx 0.7 \quad (\text{high alignment of attributes with field})
\]
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.4 \quad (\text{moderate alignment of attributes with field})
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
