To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to set up each component of Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch (which can be found by summing the product of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) over all possible fields).

For simplicity, let's assume:
1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal (i.e., we have no initial preference for Adam being in any particular field over another). For example, for two fields, each \( P(H) \) can be taken as 0.5.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is proportional to how well Adam's personality sketch fits the stereotypical personality traits of students in those fields.

Given Adam's traits:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy, which align well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is likely to be high.
- Computer Science: While Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving capabilities, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with this field, his stronger inclination toward nature and animals makes \( P(E|H) \) lower compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign reasonable estimates based on the alignment of traits:

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)

Assuming equal priors:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

Then the total probability \( P(E) \) is:
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.5 \]

Finally, using Bayes' rule:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
