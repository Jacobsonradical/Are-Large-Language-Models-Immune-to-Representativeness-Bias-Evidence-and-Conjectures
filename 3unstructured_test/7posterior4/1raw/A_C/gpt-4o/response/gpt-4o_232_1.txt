To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each specific field, we can use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have the exact values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we need to make estimations based on the information provided. 

### Estimating the Terms:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
    - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Let's assume a relatively low prior probability for an average graduate student choosing this field. For example, 5 out of 100 graduate students enroll in this field, so \( P(\text{Agri}) \approx 0.05 \).
    - **Computer Science:** This is a very popular field, so let's assume 20 out of 100 graduate students enroll in this field, so \( P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.20 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
    - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work,  these factors align well with this field. Let’s assume a high likelihood of \( P(E|\text{Agri}) \approx 0.7 \).
    - **Computer Science:** While Adam’s intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit computer science, other traits (e.g., love for nature and animals) do not align strongly. We might assume a lower likelihood: \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \):**
   Since there are many possible fields and we are only examining two, the exact \( P(E) \) is not easily computed. However, as we are comparing relative probabilities, we can compare the numerators directly.

### Calculation:

Given the above estimates:

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Agri}) \cdot P(\text{Agri}) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06
\]

To find the relative probabilities:

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{Agri}} = \frac{0.035}{0.035 + 0.06} = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.06}{0.035 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.095} \approx 0.632
\]

### Final Estimations:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368,
  "computer science": 0.632
}
```
These values represent the relative posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in either field given his personality sketch.
