To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of study and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Since the priors and likelihoods are not provided, I'll proceed with reasonable assumptions based on the given information about Adam's personality and interests.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we lack specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we will make qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of E given H in agricultural and veterinary science is high because of Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume a moderate prior probability for simplicity, as agricultural and veterinary science is not an uncommon field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of E given H in computer science is moderate. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are relevant traits, but other elements like love for animals and nature are less relevant.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a popular field, so let's assume a high prior probability.

Here's a qualitative estimate for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns more closely with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, so I estimated a higher probability.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's problem-solving skills and intelligence match, other aspects of his personality sketch relate less directly to computer science, so I assigned a lower probability, even though the field itself is popular among graduate students.
