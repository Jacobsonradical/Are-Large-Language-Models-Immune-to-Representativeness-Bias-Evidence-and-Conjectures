To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \(E\) given that the hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

We will need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities and likelihoods. Given Adam's personality sketch, we can intuitively assign probabilities:

1. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals makes it more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suggest he might also be enrolled in computer science, but this is not as strongly supported by the personality sketch.

Assuming some hypothetical probabilities:
- \( P(H_{cs}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) = Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in computer science.
- \( P(H_{av}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{av}) \) = Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) = Overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Let's assign arbitrary but reasonable values:
1. \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.3 \)
2. \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(H_{av}) = 0.2 \)
4. \( P(E|H_{av}) = 0.9 \)
5. Let's approximate \( P(E) \) given \( E \) is quite unique: \( P(E) = 0.5 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.30
\]

\[
P(H_{av}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{av}) \cdot P(H_{av})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.5} = \frac{0.18}{0.5} = 0.36
\]

Given these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36
}
```

Note: The exact values might vary based on actual prior and likelihood probabilities, but these are reasonable estimates based on the given sketch.
