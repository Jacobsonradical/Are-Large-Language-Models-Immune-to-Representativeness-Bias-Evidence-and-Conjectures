To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in either Agricultural and Veterinary Science or Computer Science given his personality sketch \( E \), we should use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll need to make reasoned estimates based on the provided description. Let’s first consider the details of the personality sketch \( E \):

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, loves animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Reasoned Estimates:**

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): This field is less commonly chosen by graduate students, but Adam’s love for nature and animals strongly aligns with this field. However, we don’t have precise statistics.
  - \( P(E|H) \): High alignment due to empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about plants and nature.

- **Computer Science:**
  - \( P(H) \): This is a very common field for graduate students due to its broad application and market demand.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well, but it is less aligned with his love for animals and nature.

Given these points, we can make a qualitative assessment:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These probabilities are reasoned estimates based on the alignment of his personality traits with each field. The value for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is higher because the traits described strongly suggest a match. Computer Science, while fitting some aspects like puzzle-solving and abstract thinking, is less aligned with his naturalistic and empathetic traits.
