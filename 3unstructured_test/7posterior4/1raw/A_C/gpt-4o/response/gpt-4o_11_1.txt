To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood and prior probability of each field of study for Adam based on the provided personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical data for the following probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is in a particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

We can only qualitatively assess the probabilities based on the given details in the personality sketch and common characteristics of students in these fields. 

Given the personality sketch \( E \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adamâ€™s love of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, though there is no specific mention of interest in computing or technology in the sketch.

So, while we cannot provide exact values, we can assess relative probabilities qualitatively.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are based on the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science, while recognizing that his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are positive indicators for computer science.
