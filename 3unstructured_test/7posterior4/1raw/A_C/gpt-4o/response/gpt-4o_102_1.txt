To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch.

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll need to make educated guesses based on the information provided. Note that these values are illustrative and not derived from concrete data.

Let's assume:
1. Adam's traits suggest a higher probability of him being in fields that involve nature, animals, or abstract thinking.
2. Bayesian inference requires some estimation of these values. 

We expect that a personality sketch aligning with agricultural and veterinary science will be higher due to its direct relevance to animals and nature.

For computer science:
- Although interest in puzzles and abstract thinking is relevant, the traits related to animals and nature may not align as strongly.

Let's denote the following indicative probabilities:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \]

Let's assume priors (educated guesses about the general popularity of the fields among graduate students):
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \]

Assuming the marginal probability:
\[ P(E) \] can be arbitrarily set by normalizing as we might have to compare across fields. But for simplicity, we'll treat it as a common factor for computation. 

Using Bayes' rule and normalizing later:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.4}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

Since both posteriors are computed to be equal under these illustrative assumptions, and since in real-life the normalization constant would indeed sum to resolve other fields being taken into account.

Thus:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.12",
  "computer science": "0.12"
}

This equal assessment is balanced based on one key point: Empathy towards animals betters Agri/Vet but puzzles/abstract holds for CS. This is a simplified approach and would be further tuned with more precise estimates and diverse marginal factors.
