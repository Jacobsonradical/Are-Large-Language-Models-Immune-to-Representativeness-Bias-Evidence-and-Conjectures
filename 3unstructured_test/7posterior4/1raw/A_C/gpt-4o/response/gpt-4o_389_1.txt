To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given that Adam is in each field. However, since these specific values are not given, we will make reasonable qualitative assessments instead.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch being observed) can be treated as a normalization factor and doesn't affect the relative comparison if we are only interested in comparing \( P(H|E) \) among different hypotheses.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Reasonably moderate, as agricultural and veterinary science is a common field but not overwhelmingly dominant among graduate students.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, since Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, combined with empathy and dedication, aligns well with this field.

### Computer Science

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: High, as computer science is one of the most common and rapidly growing fields for graduate students in the U.S.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to low, given that while intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are aligned with computer science, the strong interest in nature, plants, and animals is less directly aligned.

Combining these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods given the noticeable alignment of Adam's personality sketch with agricultural and veterinary science over computer science, albeit recognizing the high prior for enrollment in computer science.
