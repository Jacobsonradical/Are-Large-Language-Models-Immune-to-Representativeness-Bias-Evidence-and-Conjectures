To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values of the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, we will make a qualitative assessment based on the given information about Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and empathy strongly align with interests typically found in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - **P(H)**: This field might be less common among graduate students compared to other fields, so we might consider it lower without specific data.
   - **P(E)**: Given that Adam's personality aligns strongly with characteristics common in agricultural and veterinary fields, this should be high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence, curiosity for puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with characteristics desired in computer science.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a highly popular field, so we might consider a higher prior probability.
   - **P(E)**: Given Adamâ€™s characteristics, this too is potentially high, but less so compared to those for agricultural and veterinary science due to less direct overlap with "love for animals."

Based on these qualitative assessments, my estimates for \( P(H|E) \) are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```

These values are estimates and would be more accurately determined with additional specific data regarding prior distributions and likelihoods.
