To compute the posterior probabilities, we need to use Bayes' Rule, which in this context is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (computer science or agricultural and veterinary science) given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having this personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a random student is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which is the total probability of the personality sketch occurring across all fields.

Since we do not have empirical data for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we'll make some qualitative assumptions:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \) might be lower because even though computer science students can be intelligent and enjoy puzzles, they might not typically have as strong a focus on nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri vet sci}}) \) is likely higher given Adam's deep love for nature and animals, coupled with his warm heart and empathy, traits beneficial in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Letâ€™s use \( P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(H_{\text{agri vet sci}}) = 0.1 \) as prior probabilities, assuming computer science is a more common field of study than agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the qualitative analysis:
- Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri vet sci}}) \approx 0.9 \)

For normalization, we'd need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agri vet sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri vet sci}}) + \text{other fields} \]

Since the exact contribution of "other fields" is not specified, these posterior probabilities can be considered rough estimates:
- For computer science: 
\[ P(H_{\text{comp sci}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]
- For agricultural and veterinary science: 
\[ P(H_{\text{agri vet sci}}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume the total \( P(E) \) for these fields is enough to make a rough estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.07",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.27"
}

By making quantitative assumptions in combination with qualitative analysis, we can try to estimate the posterior probabilities. In practice, these should be refined with more accurate prior distributions and likelihoods.
