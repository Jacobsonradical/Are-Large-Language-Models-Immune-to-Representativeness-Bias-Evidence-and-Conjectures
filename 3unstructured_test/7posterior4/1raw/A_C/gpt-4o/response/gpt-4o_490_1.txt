To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:

- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\).

Let's consider Adam's personality sketch to estimate \(P(E|H)\) for each field. 

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Personality traits such as high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts align with computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals are less directly related to computer science.
   - Prior probability (\(P(H)\)) for a student being in computer science might be relatively high given the demand and number of students in this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - High intelligence and solving puzzles are relevant but less specific compared to computer science.
   - Prior probability (\(P(H)\)) for a student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than computer science given the fewer number of students typically in this field.

Given that we don't have exact values for each term, we'll make educated estimates:

- Assume \(P(H)\) for computer science is relatively higher, say 0.2.
- Assume \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively lower, say 0.05.
- Assume \(P(E|H)\) for computer science is moderately high because of the abstract concepts and intelligence traits, say 0.4.
- Assume \(P(E|H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science is quite high because of the strong alignment with nature curiosity, empathy, and love for animals, say 0.7.

For simplicity, we assume \(P(E)\) is the same across hypotheses and normalizes the equation.

Using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

We can see that these give us a ratio rather than the exact probabilities, but since we're only comparing these two fields:

\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{P(E)}
\]

We can then normalize these relative values to get a form of comparative posterior probabilities. Normalizing these:

\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.035} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.115} \approx 0.6957
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \approx \frac{0.035}{0.08 + 0.035} \approx \frac{0.035}{0.115} \approx 0.3043
\]

So the normalized posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6957,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3043
}
```
