To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

### Assumptions
To simplify, we'll assume typical priors due to lack of specific data:
1. \( P(H) \) can be estimated based on the general distribution of graduate students in different fields, though specifics might vary. Let's assume a rough distribution as follows:
   - Computer Science: 20%
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 5%

2. \( P(E|H) \):
   - For Computer Science, the description matches partially, especially in terms of high intelligence and problem-solving skills but doesn't align strongly with nature and animals.
   - For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, the description aligns strongly, especially with empathy, a love for nature and animals, and understanding hard work.

### Let's assume the following likelihoods:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{CS}})\) ≈ 0.3 for Computer Science, as some traits match moderately.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{Agri-Vet}})\) ≈ 0.7 for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, as the traits align strongly.

### Marginal Likelihood \(P(E)\):
Since exact calculation of \(P(E)\) requires summing the weighted likelihoods over all possible hypotheses, we'll assume it as a normalizing constant which leads us to express answers in relative terms.

#### Calculation

Using Bayes' Rule:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) ≈ \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ ≈ \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}|E) ≈ \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Agri-Vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agri-Vet}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ ≈ \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

### Relative Computations
Since \(P(E)\) normalizes these probabilities, the comparison will be:

Computer Science relative:
\[ 0.3 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06 \]

Agricultural and Veterinary Science relative:
\[ 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Thus:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.035"
}
```

These relative values suggest that, while there is some match to both fields, based on the given description, Adam is more likely to have been in a Computer Science program due to the higher relative value, albeit without the surrounding context of other fields reducing precision. Adjusting priors or adding more context might shift this balance.
