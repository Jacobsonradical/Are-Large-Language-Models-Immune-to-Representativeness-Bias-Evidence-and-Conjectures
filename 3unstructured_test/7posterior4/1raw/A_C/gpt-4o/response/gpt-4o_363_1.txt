Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate the following:
- Prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field.
- Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field.

Given:
- Adam's traits suggest a strong fit for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.
- "Agricultural and veterinary science" aligns well with Adam's love for nature and animals.
- "Computer science" could align with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.

Let's assume hypothetical values for the priors and likelihoods:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \):
  - \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.05 \) (5% of students are in agricultural and veterinary science).
  - \( P(H_{computer}) = 0.15 \) (15% of students are in computer science).

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - For agricultural and veterinary science:
    - High likelihood because of Adam's love for nature and animals.
    - \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 \)
  - For computer science:
    - Moderate likelihood due to interest in puzzles and abstract concepts.
    - \( P(E|H_{computer}) = 0.4 \)

Finally, the evidence \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant and can be simplified since we are comparing relative probabilities. Therefore, exact values arenâ€™t necessary for \( P(E) \).

Combining these estimates:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]

We normalize by dividing each by the sum of the numerators:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.15} = \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.06} = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4 \]

For computer science:
\[ \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.4 \cdot 0.15} = \frac{0.06}{0.04 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}
