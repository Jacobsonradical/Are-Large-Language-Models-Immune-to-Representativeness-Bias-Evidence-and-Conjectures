Sure. Let me walk through the required steps first before providing the probabilities.

To apply Bayes' rule, we need the following components:
1. The prior probability P(H) for each hypothesis H (this is typically the base rate of students studying each field).
2. The likelihood P(E|H), which is the probability of observing the evidence E given that the hypothesis H is true.
3. The prior probability of the evidence P(E) (this is usually a normalization factor).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior probabilities or the likelihood values, we'll have to make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided.

For computer science:
- Adam’s high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and problem-solving skills align well with the demands of computer science.
- However, his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for nature are less commonly emphasized traits in this field.
  
For agricultural and veterinary science:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work fit very well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is higher for agricultural and veterinary science than for computer science. Let’s assume equal priors for now since that information is not provided.

Thus:
\[ P(H_c|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_c) \cdot P(H_c)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_a|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(E)} \]

Given our assessment, \(P(E|H_a) > P(E|H_c)\).

By expressing these in terms of qualitative probabilities, we get something along these lines:

{
  "computer science": 0.3, // Moderate likelihood given abstract thinking and problem-solving fit
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 // Higher likelihood given empathy, love for nature, plants, and animals fit strongly
}

These values are reasonably indicative of the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the respective fields.
