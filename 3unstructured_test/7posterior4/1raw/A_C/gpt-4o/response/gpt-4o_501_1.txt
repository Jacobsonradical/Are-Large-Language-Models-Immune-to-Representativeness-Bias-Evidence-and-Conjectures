To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis, denoted \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, denoted \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're trying to compare the probabilities between two fields, we can ignore \( P(E) \) as it is the same for both calculations and cancels out when comparing relative probabilities.

### Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Without specific data, let's assume a rough equal prior probability for simplicity, though in practice, you might adjust these based on enrollment statistics:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.15 \)

### Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))
We need to estimate how likely the sketch \( E \) is for each field:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - High likelihood of having a deep love for animals and nature.
  - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)

- **Computer Science**:
  - Curiosity and strong intelligence are a fit.
  - Enjoys solving puzzles, which is common in computer science.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.6 \)

Now, we apply Bayes' rule:

### Posterior Probability
1. \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

2. \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \):
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

We can now normalize these probabilities if desired to compare them directly, but since we're asked for individual probabilities:

### Final Conditional Probabilities
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```
Note: These values indicate a rough estimate of how fitting each field is for Adam based on the provided personality sketch \( E \). More accurate estimates would require more detailed priors and likelihoods, as well as normalization.
