To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given that we need to estimate these probabilities without specific numerical data, we can only provide a rough qualitative estimate based on the given information.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Adamâ€™s love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
   - **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Based on general trends, agriculture and veterinary fields are less common than some other popular fields like computer science. Thus, \( P(H) \) might be lower compared to computer science.
   - **P(E) (Total Probability of Evidence)**: This is constant across both hypotheses, so we don't need to estimate it explicitly for our comparative purposes.

2. **Computer Science:**

   - **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**: Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts are highly valued in computer science, but his empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) could be moderate.
   - **P(H) (Prior Probability)**: Computer Science is a very popular graduate field, so \( P(H) \) is higher in general.
   - **P(E) (Total Probability of Evidence)**: Again, this remains constant.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can estimate the posterior probabilities. Note that exact numerical values are not provided due to the hypothetical nature.

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3

In this estimation, agricultural and veterinary science receives a higher posterior probability due to stronger alignment with Adam's personality sketch, despite potentially lower priors compared to computer science.
