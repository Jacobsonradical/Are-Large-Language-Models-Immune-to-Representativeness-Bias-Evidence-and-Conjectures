To determine the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without knowing the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can't compute the exact numeric values. We can, however, offer a qualitative assessment based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly align with this field.
   - High empathy and appreciation for hard work support a career in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's quiet nature and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with computational and abstract thinking requirements of computer science.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also key features of a good computer scientist.

Given these qualitative clues and without exact priors or likelihoods, we can hypothesize the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // Strong alignment with nature and animals
  "computer science": 0.4  // Alignment with abstract thinking and puzzle solving
}
```

Please remember, these are qualitative estimates and not computed values. Probabilities might need adjustments based on additional information or specific priors \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).
