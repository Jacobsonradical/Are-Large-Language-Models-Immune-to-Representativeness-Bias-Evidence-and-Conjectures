To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to perform this calculation, we need the following pieces of information:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \). Since we are considering multiple fields, this can be a bit more complex to determine, but often in practical applications, specific values may be approximately proportional.

Given that we don't have the exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch and general observations:

1. **Computer Science**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving ability, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with traits commonly found in computer science students, suggesting a moderately high \( P(E|H) \).
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a common graduate field, thus \( P(H) \) might be relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication align very well with traits found in students of agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting a high \( P(E|H) \).
   - **P(H)**: This field might be less common compared to computer science but still significant given Adam’s interests.

By assigning reasonable likelihoods and normalizing them, we can approximate the conditional probabilities. Let’s assume some prior probabilities \( P(H) \approx 0.4 \) for computer science and \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) for agricultural and veterinary science for the sake of comparison. 

After normalizing, we get:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.7, \quad P(E|H_{\text{Agri/Vet}}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(E) \text{ being a complex value, let's normalize the final values accordingly.} \]

Using these rough estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45
}

These values indicate that Adam's personality sketch fits better with Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science, but there's still a significant probability for Computer Science due to the versatility of the traits described.

Please note that these values are estimations and in real scenarios, the exact data and priors would be necessary for precise calculation.
