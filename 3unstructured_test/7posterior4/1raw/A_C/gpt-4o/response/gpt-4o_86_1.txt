To apply Bayes' rule and calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each respective field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of Adam having his personality traits given each field (\( P(E|H) \)), and the overall probability of Adam having these personality traits (\( P(E) \)). For this response, we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions about these values as they are not explicitly provided in your query.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))**:
   - Prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science: Let's assume 10% (0.10), as it is a specialized field.
   - Prior probability of being in computer science: Let's assume 25% (0.25), as it is a common field of study.

2. **Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \))**:
   - Likelihood of showing these traits in agricultural and veterinary science: Given his love for nature, animals, and plants, it would be high—let's assume 80% (0.80).
   - Likelihood of showing these traits in computer science: Given his high intelligence and proficiency with abstract concepts, this would be moderately high—let's assume 40% (0.40).

3. **Overall Probability (\( P(E) \))**:
   - This is a combination of the probabilities of Adam exhibiting those traits across all possible fields. For simplicity, let's assume this value is 0.20.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Calculations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agriculture}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{agriculture}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{agriculture}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.10}{0.20} = \frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.40 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{P(E|H)_{\text{computer science}} \cdot P(H)_{\text{computer science}}}{P(E)} = \frac{0.40 \cdot 0.25}{0.20} = \frac{0.10}{0.20} = 0.50 \]

### Results:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.40,
  "computer science": 0.50
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science, given his personality traits.
