To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will have to make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Many graduate students choose computer science, so let's denote this as reasonably high.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam is described as having high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science. However, his curiosity about nature and deep love for animals does not strongly align with this field. Therefore, let's denote this likelihood as moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Fewer students may go into this field compared to computer science, so let's denote this as moderately lower.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field, so let's denote this likelihood as high.

Based on these qualitative considerations:
- \( P(H|E) \) for computer science should be less than for agricultural and veterinary science, given Adam's personality and interests.

Now, let's estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively without specific numerical values:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This suggests that, based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
