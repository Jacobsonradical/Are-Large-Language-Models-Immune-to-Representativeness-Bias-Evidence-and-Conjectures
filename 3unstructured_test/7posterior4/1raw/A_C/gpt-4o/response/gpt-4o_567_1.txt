To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Unfortunately, without specific values for these probabilities, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of \( P(H|E) \) for each field. However, we can discuss the qualitative likelihood based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the two fields:

1. **Computer Science:** 
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This would depend on the general enrollment statistics in computer science graduate programs, but it is not provided.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are strong indicators for probability in computer science. However, his warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals may not align as closely with typical personal interests in this field.
   - Therefore, while likely, it may not be as strong as other fields more closely tied to his interests and personality.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This would depend on the general enrollment statistics in agricultural and veterinary science graduate programs, but it is not provided.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, deep love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. His characteristics suggest a high likelihood of being in this field.
   
Given the qualitative characteristics, we can infer the following qualitative posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": "between 0 and 0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "between 0.7 and 1"
}
```
These values are hypothetical and meant to convey the likelihood in qualitative terms, not exact numerical probabilities.
