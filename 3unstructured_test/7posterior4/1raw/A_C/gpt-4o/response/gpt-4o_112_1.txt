To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we should apply Bayesian inference. The key formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given the qualitative nature of the personality sketch and without specific numerical priors, I'll provide an educated estimation based on the context provided.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's personality fitting with someone in computer science would be moderate. His affinity for solving puzzles and high intelligence suggest a fit, but the strong emphasis on nature and animals does not align perfectly.
   - **\( P(H) \)**: Prior probability might be based on the general popularity of computer science among graduate students.
   - **\( P(E) \)**: This can be considered a normalizing constant across all hypotheses; we don't have these values, so we'll work relatively.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field.
   - **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability may be lower relative to computer science due to fewer students typically enrolled in this specialization.
   - **\( P(E) \)**: This remains the same normalizing constant.

Given these considerations:

- High likelihood and moderate prior: Agricultural and veterinary science aligns very well with Adam's personality.
- Moderate likelihood and higher prior: Computer Science aligns with some cognitive traits but less with others related to nature.

To quantify, approximations might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This is a simplified estimation. A complete Bayesian analysis would require actual data for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).
