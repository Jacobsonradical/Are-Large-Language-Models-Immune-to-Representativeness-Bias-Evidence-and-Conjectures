To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

For simplicity, let's make a few assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields; this means there is no initial bias toward one field over the other.
2. \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields because it is common to both.
3. What matters most here is \( P(E|H) \), or how likely Adam's personality sketch matches each field.

Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science. His interest in puzzles and high intelligence might suit computer science, but these are less emphasized compared to his other personality traits.

Therefore, let's make an educated guess about the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Given \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \) are equal, the posterior probability ratios will reflect the likelihoods:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
