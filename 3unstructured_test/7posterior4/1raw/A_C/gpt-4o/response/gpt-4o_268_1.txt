To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of study (the likelihood of Adam being in each field before knowing his personality), and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field of study (the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is in a particular field).

Bayes' rule is given by the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the overall evidence \( P(E) \) are not provided, we'll make reasonable assumptions for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \). 

We'll assume the following plausible prior probabilities based on the popularity of fields among graduate students:
- Prior probability for computer science \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \)
- Prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \)

Next, evaluating the likelihood of Adam's personality (E) given each field:
- Likelihood of Adam's personality given computer science \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \) (since Adam's personality doesn't strongly align with typical computer science traits)
- Likelihood of Adam's personality given agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.6 \) (as Adam's traits strongly resonate with this field)

For Adam's overall personality characteristics (E), we make the following assumption:
- \( P(E) \), the marginal likelihood of Adam's personality, is a normalization factor and does not need to be specified exactly since it will cancel out in the ratio form for the purposes of comparing fields.

Now applying Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}} | E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) is constant and known as a normalization factor:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}} | E) \approx 0.03 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}} | E) \approx 0.06 \]

This gives us a comparative likelihood; given the same personality traits:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.06
}
```

This rough estimate indicates that given Adam's personality traits, he is comparatively twice as likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, according to the assumed probabilities. Note that in a real-world scenario, accurate priors and likelihoods would be necessary for precise probabilities.
