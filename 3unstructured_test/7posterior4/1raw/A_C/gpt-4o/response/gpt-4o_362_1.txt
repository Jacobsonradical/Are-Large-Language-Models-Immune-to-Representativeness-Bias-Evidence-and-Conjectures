To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods related to the fields of study given Adam's personality sketch \( E \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) for these fields, we will make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on Adam's traits and the typical characteristics of these fields of study.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
    - Assume the base rate for each field among all graduate students is \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (for simplicity).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
    - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Very likely. Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy fits this field well. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
    - **Computer Science**: Somewhat likely. Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles fit computer science well, but less so than agricultural science based on his traits. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Marginal likelihood \(P(E)\)**:
    - This is harder to estimate without more data. For simplicity, we will assume:
      \[ P(E) \approx \sum_H P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
      Given only these two fields, let's set \( P(E) \approx 0.55 \).

### Calculation:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   
\[ P(H = \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.55} \approx 0.0727 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   
\[ P(H = \text{Computer Science} | E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.05}{0.55} \approx 0.0273 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.0727,
  "computer science": 0.0273
}
```

Note that these estimates are based on the qualitative assessment and assumed probabilities. The real values would require actual data for precise calculation.
