Sure, let's compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule. First, we need to define Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field \( H \), let's consider:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

While specific values for these probabilities are not provided, we can make some reasonable estimates based on the information:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy aligns well with this field. This should be relatively high.
- \( P(H) \): This field generally has fewer students than some other fields, so the prior might be moderate to low.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of someone in any field having Adam's combination of personality traits.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with this field. However, his deep love for nature, animals, and empathy might not be as strongly associated.
- \( P(H) \): Computer Science generally has a large number of students, so the prior might be relatively high.
- \( P(E) \): Same as above.

Without specific numerical values, we can make qualitative assessments:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Let's assume this is relatively high, say 0.7.
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is moderate, say 0.1.
- \( P(E) \): This is the same for both fields, so it will cancel out in the comparison.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Let's assume this is moderate, say 0.4.
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume this is higher due to more students, say 0.2.
- \( P(E) \): Same as above.

We can compute relative probabilities without \( P(E) \):

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Since the absolute values of \( P(E) \) are the same, these proportional values can be viewed directly in context to other priors.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities can be represented as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
