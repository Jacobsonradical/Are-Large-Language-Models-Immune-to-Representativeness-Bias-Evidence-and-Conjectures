To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need a few components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of being enrolled in each field without considering the personality sketch \( E \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) being observed given enrollment in the specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which normalizes the result to ensure the total probability adds up to one.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since computing the precise values requires detailed statistical data on the priors and likelihoods, we'll make educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Let's assume the following for simplicity:

### Priors:
Let \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \): A reasonable assumption given the variety of fields available and their typical enrollment rates.
Let \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.15 \): Computer science being a popular field might have a higher prior.

### Likelihoods based on the sketch:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Strong curiosity about nature and plants: High likelihood.
- Deep love for animals: High likelihood.
- Empathy and warm heart: Reasonably high likelihood.

Given this, let's assume:
\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \]

#### Computer Science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles: High likelihood.
- High intelligence and abstract thinking: High likelihood.

However, less emphasis is placed on nature, plants, and animals compared to the other field:
\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \]

### Calculating Posteriors:
We assume the evidence \( P(E) \) normalizes the expression, so simplified computations directly proportional calculations would be:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

### Normalize:
Given that total normalization isn't needed, let's provide the relative values directly:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "computer science": 0.06
}
```

These values represent the normalized computation, showing a higher posterior probability for Adam being in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch. However, both values are still relatively low, acknowledging that other fields could also be relevant given his interests and characteristics.
