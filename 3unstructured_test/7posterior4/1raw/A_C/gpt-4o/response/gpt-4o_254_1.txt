To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

To solve this, we need to estimate:
1. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
2. The prior \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in the specific field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which would require summing over all possible fields. 

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we do not have detailed statistical data available. We will instead make reasoned qualitative estimates.

### Estimating Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
**Agricultural and veterinary science**:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- A deep love for animals.
- Strong empathy.
The likelihood for agricultural and veterinary sciences is quite high.

**Computer science**:
- High intelligence.
- Good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
The likelihood for computer science is moderate to high.

### Estimating Priors \( P(H) \)
Assume average general population distribution:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Lower enrollment compared to computer science.
- Computer science: Much higher enrollment.

### Calculating Posterior \( P(H|E) \)
Without concrete numbers, we can provide qualitative summaries:

Given the qualitative reasoning, the approximate posterior probabilities can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These are illustrative values based on qualitative reasoning and not precise computations.
