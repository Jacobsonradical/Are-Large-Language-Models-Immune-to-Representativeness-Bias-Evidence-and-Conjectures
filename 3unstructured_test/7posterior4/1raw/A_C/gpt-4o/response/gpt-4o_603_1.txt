Applying Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field requires the following components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The general probability of a graduate student being enrolled in a given field before considering Adam's personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits assuming he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields. For simplification, although it's part of the calculation, we assume itâ€™s the same for all hypotheses since we are comparing them.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Below are reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability could be informed by enrollment statistics.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): High, because his interests and empathy align well with this field.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability could be higher because more students might be enrolled in this field.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Lower, because while his intelligence and problem-solving skills fit, his empathy and nature interest do not.

Given the qualitative nature and for illustration, we can choose reasonable probability values without specific statistical data.

Now let's assign some quantitative values:
- Assume \( P(H_1) = 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science)
- Assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \) (80% likelihood given his personality)
- Assume \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students are in computer science)
- Assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \) (20% likelihood given his personality)

The evidence \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + \text{(probabilities of other fields)} \]
  
Simplified for comparison purposes (not affecting proportional values):
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) = 0.08 + 0.04 = 0.12 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_1|E) \) and \( P(H_2|E) \):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.12} \approx 0.6667 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.12} \approx 0.3333 \]

To summarize:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6667,
  "computer science": 0.3333
}
```

Note: Exact values may vary in a more rigorous context with more precise priors and likelihoods.
