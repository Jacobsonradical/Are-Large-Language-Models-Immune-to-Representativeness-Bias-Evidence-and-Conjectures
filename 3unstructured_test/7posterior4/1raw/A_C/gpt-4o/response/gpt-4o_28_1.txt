To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to express Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given only the personality sketch and without additional specific data about the fields and their enrollments, we must make some general assumptions based on the provided information:

- Adam has a strong empathy and deep love for animals, which is a stronger indicator for "agricultural and veterinary science".
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, which can align with "computer science".

For simplicity, let's assume that both fields are equally likely a priori, so \( P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \).

Next, we evaluate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) and \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \):

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Given that he is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, and is good at understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science, but the love for nature and animals is less indicative of computer science. Let's say this is moderately likely, so we assign a probability of 0.3.
  
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The love for nature, empathy, and deep love for animals strongly align with this field. The understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well here. Let's assign a higher probability of 0.7.

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.5) + (0.7 \cdot 0.5) = 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.5 \]

Now we compute \( P(\text{computer science}|E) \) and \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \):

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
