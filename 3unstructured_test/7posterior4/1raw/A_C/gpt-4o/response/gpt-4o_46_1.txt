To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of him having the described personality sketch given each field. Without specific numerical data, we can make reasonable estimates based on the information provided.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given he is in this field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in this field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of someone having Adam's traits.

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - These traits are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with good understanding of abstract concepts.
   - While these traits are consistent with computer science, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly related to this field.

Given these assessments:

- **Prior probabilities**: Let's assume the fields are broadly popular among graduate students but with unknown exact proportions.
- **Likelihoods**: Traits like love for plants and animals are very relevant to agricultural and veterinary science, while puzzle-solving and abstract thinking are more relevant to computer science but not exclusive.

We can approximately assign higher likelihood to the agricultural and veterinary science due to more traits aligning closely with this field. 

Thus, the qualitative estimates of the probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This is a qualitative estimate without specific numerical data, representing a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science due to his personality traits aligning more closely with that field.
