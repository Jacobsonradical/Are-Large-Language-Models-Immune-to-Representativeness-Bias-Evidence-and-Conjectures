Certainly! To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given that he is in each specific field, and the normalization factor \( P(E) \), the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have numerical data to create precise calculations, we can discuss realistically how probable these degrees are given Adam's personality traits.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   These are generally estimated based on the number of students typically enrolled in these fields. However, without specific data, we make educated guesses.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   This assesses how likely Adam's personality sketch fits into each specific field. 

Given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, Adam seems to fit better in fields involving nature and animals, like agricultural and veterinary science, compared to computer science.

Given these assumptions:

- **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{agr}) \)**: High. The personality traits closely match the field.
  - **Prior \( P(H_{agr}) \)**: Moderate to low, as fewer graduates typically enroll compared to more common fields like computer science.

- **For Computer Science**:
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: Lower but non-zero. High intelligence and abstract thinking fit well, but other traits fit less naturally.
  - **Prior \( P(H_{cs}) \)**: High as computer science is a common field of study.

Normalization \( P(E) \):
- This could be complex to compute unless all relevant hypotheses are considered, so we focus on the relative likelihoods.

With these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values show that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
