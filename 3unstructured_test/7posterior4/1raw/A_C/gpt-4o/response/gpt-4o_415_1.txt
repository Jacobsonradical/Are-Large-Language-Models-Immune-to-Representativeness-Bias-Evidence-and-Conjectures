To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given each field (\( P(E|H) \)), it's challenging to provide precise numerical values. Instead, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

We'll assume:
- \( P(H) \): The general likelihood of any given student enrolling in each field, reflecting the popularity of the field.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the described characteristics aligning with each field.

Given:
- Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam’s high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit both computer science and agricultural and veterinary science but does not provide a unique advantage for either. 
- His empathy and warm heart might suggest a stronger alignment with animal care and agricultural science than with the more technical and perhaps less empathetically demanding field of computer science.

These qualitative assessments lead us to the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These values are illustrative and reflect a qualitative judgment based on the given personality sketch rather than quantified data. In a more rigorous analysis, one would need to collect empirical data to assign precise values.
