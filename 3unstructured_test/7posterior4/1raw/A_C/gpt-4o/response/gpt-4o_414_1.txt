To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), an exact calculation isn't possible. Instead, we can provide a reasoned estimate based on the personality sketch provided:

Given the personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong empathy and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

**Hypothesis: Computer Science**
- Quiet and enjoy solving puzzles aligns well with computer science students.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts favor computer science.
- However, love for animals and strong empathy aren't particularly directly related.

**Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants strongly supports this field.
- Love for animals is highly relevant.
- Strong empathy aligns well with the caring aspect of veterinary science.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work also fit well.

Based on these considerations, we can give reasoned estimates of the likelihoods:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher inferred probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to more closely matching traits, while acknowledging some suitability of computer science due to problem-solving enjoyment and abstract thinking.
