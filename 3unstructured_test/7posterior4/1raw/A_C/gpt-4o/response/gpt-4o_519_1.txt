To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute precise numerical values. Given that, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and the typical characteristics of students in the specified fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has an appreciable fascination with nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with the focus of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Strong empathy and a warm heart are also crucial traits for those working with animals.
   - Given these attributes, the probability \( P(E|H_\text{agvic}) \) is relatively high if H is agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that are beneficial in fields like computer science which demand strong problem-solving skills and abstract thinking.
   - However, the personality sketch does not strongly emphasize traits that are exclusive or particularly aligned with typical computer science students.

Hence, we can judge from the personality traits given \( E \):

\[ 
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_\text{agvic}) \quad \text{(Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} & : \text{high} \\
P(E|H_\text{comp}) \quad \text{(Computer Science)} & : \text{moderate}
\end{align*}
\]

Letâ€™s assume prior probabilities \( P(H_\text{agvic}) \) and \( P(H_\text{comp}) \) are equal due to a lack of specific data on graduate enrollment distribution. Therefore, sketching based on relative weightings assessed here:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_\text{agvic}|E) & \approx 0.7 \\
P(H_\text{comp}|E) & \approx 0.3 
\end{align*}
\]

So the output will be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
