To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in a specific field (e.g., computer science or agricultural and veterinary science).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods (numerical values) for these fields, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the given description.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common field, so we might assume a moderate prior, say 0.2 (20%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are aligned with computer science, his deep love for nature, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work might not be as strongly correlated. Thus, we assume a lower likelihood, say 0.1 (10%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is a less common field compared to computer science, so let's assume a lower prior, say 0.05 (5%).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with this field, suggesting a higher likelihood, say 0.7 (70%).

Given the above assumptions, we can now calculate the posterior probabilities. However, without knowing the exact \( P(E) \), we are using relative likelihoods instead of absolute values.

Let's calculate the ratios to infer relative beliefs:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.02 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \propto 0.035 \]

Now to provide the probabilities, they need to be normalized, but since absolute \( P(E) \) is not known and for simplicity, we use relative scales:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.3636 \]
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.02 + 0.035} \approx 0.6364 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities, denoted with reasonable estimations, are approximately:

{
  "computer science": "0.36",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.64"
