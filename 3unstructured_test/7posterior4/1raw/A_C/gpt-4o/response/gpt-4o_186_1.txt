To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Since we don't have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll have to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality traits and fields of study.

### Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is highly likely that he would be a good fit for this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \) is 0.9.
   - \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): Prior probability of a student choosing Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Let's assume a moderate value of 0.1.

2. **Computer Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's high intelligence and proficiency in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, he would also fit well in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) is 0.6.
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \): Prior probability of a student choosing Computer Science. Given the popularity, let's assume a higher value of 0.3.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is constant across fields.

### Calculations
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)}
                       = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
                       = \frac{0.09}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Computer Science**
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)}
                       = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)}
                       = \frac{0.18}{P(E)}
   \]

Although we don't have the value of \( P(E) \), we can infer relative values.

Based on these calculations, the relative possibilities are:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.09
- Computer Science: 0.18

Given these values, Computer Science is twice as likely as Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but we normalize them for probabilistic interpretation.

### Normalization
\[
\text{Total} = 0.09 + 0.18 = 0.27
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.27} \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.27} \approx 0.67
\]

Thus, the normalized posterior probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.33",
  "computer science": "0.67"
}
```

Keep in mind these values are based on assumed likelihoods and priors, which might vary in a real-world scenario.
