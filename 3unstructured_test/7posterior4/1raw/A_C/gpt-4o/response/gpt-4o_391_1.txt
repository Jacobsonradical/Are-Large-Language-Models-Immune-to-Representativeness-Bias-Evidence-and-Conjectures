To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis, we would ideally need prior probabilities and likelihoods for each hypothesis. However, in this context, we can make some reasoned estimations based on the given personality sketch and the typical attributes of students in these fields. 

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given that we may not have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make some educated guesses based on the description.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): The personality traits described (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) don't strongly align with the typical perception of a computer science student. Therefore, this likelihood might be lower.
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Computer science is a common field of study, so the prior probability is relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{avs}) \): Traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work directly align with agricultural and veterinary studies. Therefore, this likelihood is higher.
   - \( P(H_{avs}) \): This field might be less common than computer science, but given Adam's traits, the prior probability could be reasonably significant.

Considering these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This implies that based on his personality traits, the probability that Adam was studying agricultural and veterinary science is higher compared to computer science. These values are illustrative and based on the reasoning from the given evidence.
