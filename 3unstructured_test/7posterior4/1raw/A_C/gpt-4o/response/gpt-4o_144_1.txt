To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of \( E \) occurring \( P(E) \), we need to make some assumptions based on the information provided to estimate these values. 

Given \( E \) - the personality sketch - we can make qualitative estimates about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H\textsubscript{agri})**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with a graduate program in this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H\textsubscript{agri}) \) should be relatively high.
  
- **Computer Science (H\textsubscript{cs})**: Adam's high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of puzzles suggest he could succeed in computer science. However, it is less aligned with his love for nature and animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, \( P(E|H\textsubscript{cs}) \) might be somewhat lower than \( P(E|H\textsubscript{agri}) \).

Let's assign some rough estimates for the likelihoods. Remember, these are qualitative and hypothetical since we lack exact data:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(E|H\textsubscript{agri}) \approx 0.7 \)
- **Computer Science**: \( P(E|H\textsubscript{cs}) \approx 0.5 \)

If we assume equal priors, \( P(H\textsubscript{agri}) = P(H\textsubscript{cs}) = 0.5 \) (just for simplicity), we can simplify Bayes' rule comparatively as:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus, the values (normalized for simplicity) can be:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H\textsubscript{agri}|E) &\approx 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \\
P(H\textsubscript{cs}|E) &\approx 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25
\end{align*}
\]

Normalizing these results so they sum up to 1 for better proportional representation (although in reality they don't sum to 1 just for these two as more fields exist):

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H\textsubscript{agri}|E) &\approx \frac{0.35}{0.35+0.25} \approx 0.58 \\
P(H\textsubscript{cs}|E) &\approx \frac{0.25}{0.35+0.25} \approx 0.42
\end{align*}
\]

However, since the question specified not needing them to add up to 1, we can directly use our original values.
