To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given that the actual probabilities of these are not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch (E) and commonly known characteristics of the fields in question.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - We assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity, as we do not have information suggesting one field is more likely than another. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for both fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - For **computer science**, Adam's traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are likely. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less common in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \).

3. **Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \):**
   - The overall probability of the evidence can be assumed to be a normalizing constant that ensures our final probabilities are correct relative to one another. Since exact numerical values are unnecessary for proportional purposes, it's often implicitly understood in comparative scenarios.

Using Bayes' rule, we get:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since these will be scaled proportionally to each other by \( P(E) \), we can ignore \( P(E) \) and directly compare:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the probability values can be normalized (by dividing each by the sum of both values \(0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5\)) to derive proportions:

For **computer science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]
