To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and the hypotheses \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \):

1. **Computer science**:
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): The personality traits described could correlate with computer science, given interests in puzzles, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work. However, strong empathy and love for animals are less typically associated with computer science students.
   
2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): The traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

Next, let's make reasonable assumptions about the priors \( P(H) \):
- Assume the prior probability of being in any one field such as computer science or agricultural and veterinary science is about equal among graduate students (implying \( P(H_1) \approx P(H_2) \)) if we don't have any specific data.

Finally, since there are no exact numerical values, we make a qualitative assessment:
- We can assign a higher likelihood to \( P(E|H_2) \) due to better alignment with traits, and a moderate likelihood to \( P(E|H_1) \).

Given these points, we can make a rough estimation:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
Keep in mind, without exact likelihoods and priors, these values are estimates based on qualitative reasoning.
