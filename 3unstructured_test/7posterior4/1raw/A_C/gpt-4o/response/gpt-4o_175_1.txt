To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

However, since precise values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided in your query, an exact numerical computation is not feasible. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and the general characteristics of the fields of study.

### Assessment

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Evidence suggests high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles.
   - These traits are highly consistent with qualities desirable in the field of computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Evidence shows a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy.
   - These traits are highly consistent with qualities desirable in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these assessments, we can qualitatively judge that the posterior probabilities are likely to be significant for both fields but somewhat higher for agricultural and veterinary science due to the specific interest in nature and animals.

Let's denote the reasoning qualitatively as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these values are not strictly computed but are inferred based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with the fields in question.
