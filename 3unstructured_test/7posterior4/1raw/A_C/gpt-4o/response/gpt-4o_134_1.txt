To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing the evidence (the personality sketch \(E\)) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \), we can't compute exact numerical values for \( P(H|E) \). Instead, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the details in the personality sketch.

### Qualitative Assessment

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart with strong empathy, all of which strongly align with characteristics typically seen in students of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts, which are traits that align well with the typical skill set in computer science. However, the focus on nature, plants, and animals is less directly related to this field.

Given these qualitative considerations, we can make the following qualitative assessments for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "high (closer to 1)",
  "computer science": "moderate (closer to 0.5)"
}
```

To express this in a more quantitative manner (though still somewhat subjective due to lack of specific data):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

These values are chosen to reflect the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to computer science, based on the given sketch.
