To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide numerical values, we would need prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of those fields (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of each field exhibiting the given personality sketch \( E \) (\( P(E | H) \)), and the overall probability of exhibiting the personality sketch \( E \) (\( P(E) \)). Since these exact values aren't provided, we'll make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the typical profiles of students in those fields.

First, let's consider the field of "agricultural and veterinary science":

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science (qualitatively moderate, as it's a relatively smaller field compared to others like computer science).
- \( P(E | H) \): The likelihood of a person in this field having the given personality sketch (high, given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy).
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of this personality sketch (assumed to be relatively low given it is specific).

Now, consider "computer science":

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science (qualitatively high, as it's a populous and rapidly growing field).
- \( P(E | H) \): The likelihood of a person in this field having the given personality sketch (moderate to low, as it doesn't strongly align with typical profiles for computer science which focus more on abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills, though Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving capability somewhat align).
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of this personality sketch (again, assumed relatively low).

Based on these qualitative factors, we can assign indicative probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These values are not exact and would require precise data for accurate computation. However, qualitatively, the warmer, empathetic, nature-loving aspects of Adam's personality make agricultural and veterinary science more likely, whereas his intelligence and puzzle-solving aptitude lend some probability to computer science, albeit lower.
