To apply Bayes' rule and estimate the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field, we first need some contextual information. However, given the hypothetical nature of this exercise, we do not have actual prior probabilities. Instead, we will make educated guesses based on the details provided in Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify this, we will focus on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and make relative estimations about the probabilities \( P(H) \) and the evidence \( P(E) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, loves animals, and has strong empathy. This strongly aligns with a field where one may work directly with animals and plants. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \) is high.

2. **Computer Science:**

While being good at puzzles and having high intelligence could relate to computer science, attributes like a deep love for animals and nature might not be as strongly associated with this field. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is comparatively lower.

Based on this reasoning, we can assign rough values reflecting our qualitative assessment:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgriVet Science):
\[ P(H_{\text{AgriVet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AgriVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgriVet}})}{P(E)} \approx 0.8 \]

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \]

The values are based on the contextual alignment of Adam's traits with each field. Here is the final output:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values do not sum to 1 because there are other potential fields of study not considered here.
