To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which can be formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior conditional probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, we will assume generic prior probabilities based on the relative distribution of graduate students in different fields in the U.S. However, without actual numerical priors, we will base our estimates primarily on qualitative analysis of the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

### Likelihood Analysis:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it's highly likely that this field aligns with his personality sketch. We can assign a high likelihood \( P(E|H1) \).

2. **Computer Science (H2)**:
   - While Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit the profile of a computer science student, his strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are not typical traits highlighted in computer science profiles. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H2) \) would be relatively lower than for agricultural and veterinary science.

### Prior Probability (Qualitative Assumptions):
- For agricultural and veterinary science, we can assume a lower prior compared to more common graduate studies like computer science.
- For computer science, given its popularity and high enrollment rates, we can assume a higher prior.

### Posterior Probability Estimate:

Given these qualitative assessments:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values reflect our reasoning that Adam's interests and personality are more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science, despite the latter's relatively higher general enrollment rates. Note that these are qualitative estimates and would need actual data for precise computation.
