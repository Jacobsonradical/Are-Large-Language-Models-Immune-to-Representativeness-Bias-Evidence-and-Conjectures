To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand that Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have explicit probabilities to work with, we will make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch of Adam. 

For computer science and agricultural and veterinary science, let's consider the following factors:
1. **Computer Science**: This field often requires high intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses. However, it does not strongly align with his love for animals and nature.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his empathy. It also requires dedication and an appreciation for hard work, which Adam has.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the probabilities as follows based on how well each field matches Adam's personality:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the contextual alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics desired in these fields. Remember, these are rough estimates assuming equal priors and do not account for the actual distribution of students across these fields.
