To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we first recall that Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of evidence \(E\).

Without exact numerical values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E)\), we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

**For Computer Science:**

- \(P(E|H_c)\) (Likelihood that Adam has traits in \(E\) given he is in Computer Science): Given Adam's high intelligence, good problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, these traits align well with computer science.
- \(P(H_c)\) (Prior probability of a graduate student being in Computer Science): Computer Science is a popular field, but for a precise calculation, we would need specific statistics.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of having the traits described in \(E\).

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

- \(P(E|H_a)\) (Likelihood that Adam has traits in \(E\) given he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.
- \(P(H_a)\) (Prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science): This field is more specialized.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of having the traits described in \(E\).

Given these considerations:

1. Adam's empathy and deep love for animals strongly suggest a fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
2. Adam's problem-solving skills and understanding of abstract concepts also suggest he could fit well in Computer Science, though other personality traits (love for nature, animals) are less aligned with typical CS stereotypes.

Thus, we hypothesize:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These numbers are qualitative estimates based on how well Adam's traits match the typical profiles for the fields. For precise probabilities, detailed statistics and data about graduate fields and personality traits would be necessary.
