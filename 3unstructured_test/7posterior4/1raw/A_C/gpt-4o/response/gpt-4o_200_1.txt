To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the fields of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We'll assume equal prior probability for each graduate field since no specific priors are given, so \( P(H) \) will be the same for both fields. Thus, the differences in \( P(H|E) \) will be driven by the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

### Likelihood Estimation
To estimate \( P(E|H) \), we can qualitatively evaluate how well each field aligns with the subject's personality and characteristics.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong alignment with love for animals, nature, and plants.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart appropriate for animal care.
   - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with scientific work in these fields.

   Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \) relatively high because many of Adam's characteristics fit well with this field.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with this field.
   - Enjoyment in solving puzzles aligns with programming and algorithm development.
   - However, less direct alignment with the love for nature and animals (though it's not incompatible).

   We'll estimate \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \) based on these matching attributes.

Given the qualitative analysis, we can approximate the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \) and \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \).

Without precise numerical values, we can estimate the relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values reflect the higher alignment of Adam's personality with agriculture and veterinary science compared to computer science. Note that these values are estimates for illustration, not precise calculations.
