To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we are not given specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(H) (Prior Probability)**:
   - Let’s assume the prior probability for being in each field is equally likely in the absence of any other information.

2. **P(E|H) (Likelihood)**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, this field fits well.
   - **Computer Science**: Given Adam’s enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, this field also fits but possibly to a slightly lesser extent compared to agricultural and veterinary science, given the nature-centric and animal-centric interests.

Given the strong alignment for agricultural and veterinary science with Adam's traits, we can assume \(P(E|H)\) to be higher for this field.

### Estimations:
Since we must quantify this, we might reasonably estimate:

- **P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: High (e.g., 0.7)
- **P(E|Computer Science)**: Moderate (e.g., 0.3)
- **P(H)** for each field: Let’s assume it is something like 0.2 for each to keep it simple.

### Bayes' Rule Application:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)}
  \]

\( P(E) \) cancels out as we're comparing relative probabilities, so:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06
\]

Finally, normalized to the totals:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) = \frac{0.14}{0.14+0.06} = \frac{0.14}{0.20} = 0.7
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.14+0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.20} = 0.3
\]

However, without normalization and as requested, purely as the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
