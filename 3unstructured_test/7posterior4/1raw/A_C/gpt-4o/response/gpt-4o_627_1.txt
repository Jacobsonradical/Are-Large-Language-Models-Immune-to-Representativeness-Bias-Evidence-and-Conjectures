To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical data for each component, we will reason qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch and propose educated estimations for each field.

Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume it's a relatively common field, though not as ubiquitous as fields like computer science. Suppose \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \).
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are well-aligned with this field. Consequently, \( P(E|H) \) might be quite high. Suppose \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \).
    - **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This represents the overall probability of observing Adam's traits across all fields, which is more challenging to quantify. Suppose \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer Science is a very common field with numerous students enrolled. Suppose \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \).
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits, especially his intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts and puzzles, are aligned with computer science, but his naturalistic and empathetic attributes less so. Hence, \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).
    - **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The same as before, suppose \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \).

Now, we can compute the posterior \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.3} = \frac{0.15}{0.3} = 0.5 \]

So, we propose the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are qualitative and approximate, reflecting the strong coherence of Adam's personality with Agricultural and Veterinary Science and his good fit but less alignment with Computer Science.
