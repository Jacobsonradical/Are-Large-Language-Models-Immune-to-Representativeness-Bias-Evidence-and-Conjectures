To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_{AV} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We need to estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \): Probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he studies agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he studies computer science.
- \( P(H_{AV}) \) and \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probabilities of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, respectively.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability of Adam having these personality traits, which can be considered the same for both fields since we are not given specific data on this.

We can assume that \( P(E) \) for both hypotheses is the same for this comparison, so we only need to focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

### Assumptions
- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, \( P(E|H_{AV}) \) is likely high as these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Given Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and interest in abstract concepts, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is also significant but maybe not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.
  
### Prior Probabilities
- \( P(H_{AV}) \): Agriculture and veterinary science may have a smaller number of graduate students compared to computer science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer science is a more common graduate field, increasing the prior probability.

### Assigning Values
To simplify, we will assume approximate values based on qualitative reasoning.

- \( P(E|H_{AV}) \approx 0.8 \): High probability that Adam's traits fit agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.6 \): Reasonable probability that Adam's traits fit computer science given his interest in abstract concepts, but slightly less than for agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.2 \): Lower prior probability due to fewer students in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.8 \): Higher prior probability due to the large number of students in computer science.

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities
Since \( P(E) \) is common and can be simplified out, we get:
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 
  \( P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \)
- For Computer Science:
  \( P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.8 = 0.48 \)

### Normalizing the Probabilities
To give a sense of the probabilities:
- \( P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.48} = \frac{0.16}{0.64} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.48}{0.16 + 0.48} = \frac{0.48}{0.64} = 0.75 \)

Here is the approximate result:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.75
}
