To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to precisely calculate these probabilities, specific values or distributions related to \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are needed, which are not provided in the initial information. Therefore, I will make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Base Rate of Graduate Students in Each Field (\( P(H) \))**: These reflect the proportion of students in each field. For simplicity, we might assume equal probability for these fields if no further information is available. Let's assign a prior probability of 0.5 for each, given that we are only considering two fields.
2. **Likelihood of Personality Traits given Each Field (\( P(E|H) \))**:
    - For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's deep love for nature, animals, strong empathy, and warm heart, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should be high, let's assume it to be 0.8.
    - For computer science: Given Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should also be relatively high, but perhaps not as high as that for agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it to be 0.6.
3. **Marginal Probability of the Evidence (\( P(E) \))**: This is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \). While this is typically calculated by summing over all possible hypotheses, given the limited fields considered, let's approximate based on the likelihoods and priors. 

Let's proceed with these assumptions:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

### For Computer Science:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

### Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):
To find the marginal probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.6 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

### Posterior Calculations:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.4}{0.7} \approx 0.571 \]

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} = \frac{0.3}{0.7} \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
```

These computed values estimate the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in each of these fields, given his personality sketch.
