To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to the lack of specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the overall likelihood of the evidence \( P(E) \), we can't calculate the exact values. Instead, we can provide qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities based on the personality sketch provided. 

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and strong empathy make a strong case for him being in agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might also make him a good candidate for computer science, but the interest in nature and animals seems less aligned with typical computer science traits.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable qualitative approximation could be:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values are not computed values but reasonable approximations given the information provided and typical trends observed in those fields.
