To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities for each field \( P(H) \) as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that the personality sketch \( E \) fits a student in that field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in the absence of specific prior probabilities for Adam being in each field (\( P(H) \)) or the exact values for the likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)), we will make educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with each field. 

Given Adam's characteristics:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet demeanor.
3. Enjoyment of puzzles.
4. Strong empathy and love for animals.
5. High intelligence.
6. Understanding of abstract concepts.
7. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- The subject's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy fit well with this field.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is relatively high.

**Computer Science:**
- Enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts fit this field.
- The personality traits mentioned also align well with characteristics important for computer science.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign likely values for the posterior probabilities without specific priors:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values reflect the assumption that the personality sketch slightly more strongly aligns with characteristics important for fields like agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given Adam's love for animals and nature. If we had specific prior probabilities and more precise data, we could provide more accurate calculations.
