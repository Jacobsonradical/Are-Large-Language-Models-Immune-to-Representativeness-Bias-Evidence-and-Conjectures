To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in specific fields based on the given personality sketch (E), we can apply Bayes' rule. Although we don’t have concrete numerical values for the prior probabilities or the likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information available.

Bayes' rule is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Given the nature of qualitative data, we'll make educated guesses about these probabilities.

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- **P(E|H)**: High, because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field.
- **P(H)**: This is subjective, but given Adam’s traits, it might be reasonable to assume this is somewhat likely for people with his traits.
- **P(E)**: This remains constant across all hypotheses for our comparison purposes.

**For Computer Science:**
- **P(E|H)**: Moderate, since while Adam’s intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities align with computer science, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not directly correlate.
- **P(H)**: This has a high base rate due to the popularity of the field, but this doesn't necessarily mean it fits Adam's profile better.

Considering these qualitative factors, we assign probabilities within 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.30
}
```

These qualitative estimates suggest that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely for him to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Computer Science.
