To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need to make some assumptions about the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) since we don't have exact values for these probabilities. We will have to make general estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Let's assume:

- \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H = \text{computer science}) \) is the prior probability that any random graduate student is enrolled in computer science.
- For simplicity, let's assume these priors are equal for now: \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(H = \text{computer science}) = 0.1 \). 
  (Note: In reality, these probabilities could be derived from enrollment statistics of U.S. graduate students in 2021, but we'll assume equal priors for simplicity.)

To estimate \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits given that the field is agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, this probability is relatively high. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits given that the field is computer science. Adam's traits such as high intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well, but curiosity about nature and empathy are less directly relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \).

We approximate \( P(E) \) by summing the weighted likelihoods across all hypotheses:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.3 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.03 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.11 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule for each field:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.11} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.727 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.1}{0.11} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.11} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.273 \]

So the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "computer science": 0.273
}
```

Remember that these values are based on estimations and the assumption of equal priors. Real-world data could adjust these probabilities significantly.
