To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). However, in the absence of specific prior data, we can make qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam supplied (E).

**Bayes' Rule**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of this problem, let’s make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is moderate since it's a somewhat specialized field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given this field is high because the traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) align closely with this domain.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science is high because it is a common graduate field.
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch given this field is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science, as not all traits (like a deep love for animals and nature) are as closely associated with this field.

Let’s denote:
- \( \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \) hypothesis as (H1)
- \( \text{computer science} \) hypothesis as (H2)

### Estimations
1. **P(E|H1)**: High (around 0.9) because Adam's traits highly fit this field.
2. **P(E|H2)**: Moderate to low (around 0.3) because while intelligence and abstract thinking fit, empathy and animal love are not closely aligned.

### Estimated Priors
Assume equal priors for simplicity:
- \( P(H1) \approx 0.2 \) (agricultural and veterinary science is less common overall)
- \( P(H2) \approx 0.4 \) (computer science is a more common field)

### Calculations Using Bayes' Rule
1. **P(H1|E)**
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} \]
Since normalization constant \(P(E)\) is the same for both fields, we calculate the numerator for comparative purposes:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

2. **P(H2|E)**
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12 \]

### Normalization
Since we are asked for direct probabilities rather than relative comparisons:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.12} = \frac{0.18}{0.30} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.30} = 0.4 \]

Here are the approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Please note these are qualitative estimates based on traits and assumed priors, not exact numerical probabilities without specific prior data.
