To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would generally need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, as well as the likelihood of observing his personality sketch \( E \) given each field. 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will need to make qualitative assessments based on the description provided.

Given \( E \) (the personality sketch of Adam) and using our qualitative understanding:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Positive indications:
     - Adam enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with the problem-solving aspect of computer science.
     - He is high in intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which is crucial for computer science.
   - Negative indications:
     - His strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature are not directly aligned with typical computer science fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Positive indications:
     - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
     - He has a deep love for animals, which aligns well with veterinary science.
     - His warm heart and strong empathy are beneficial in the care and understanding required in veterinary fields.
   - Negative indications:
     - Less emphasis on solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, although these traits can be beneficial in scientific research and innovation.

Given these qualitative assessments, we might assign higher likelihoods based on how well Adam's personality traits match each field. 

Let's provide plausible estimations within a normalized scope, by looking at how his traits fit each domain based on the given evidence:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These values are suggestive estimates based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality sketch with the typical demands and nature of each field.
