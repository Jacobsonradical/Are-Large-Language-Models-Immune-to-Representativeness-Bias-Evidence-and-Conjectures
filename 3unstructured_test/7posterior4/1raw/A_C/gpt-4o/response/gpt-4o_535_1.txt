To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule, stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical values or priors, I'll make qualitative assumptions based on the given personality traits and fields of study. 

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume that graduate enrollment in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science is not vastly different in the broader context (this might vary by institution, but we'll take a neutral stance).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: While curiosity, intelligence, and puzzle-solving are strong indicators, this field may not directly align with Adam's appreciable love for nature, animals, and strong empathy.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: These traits are closely associated with this field, as it involves nature, plants, animals, and a practical appreciation for hard work and dedication.

3. **Normalization Constant \( P(E) \)**:
   - We do not have enough information to calculate \( P(E) \) precisely. However, this constant will be the same for both fields, and hence, we can consider a relative comparison.

### Bayes' Rule Calculation:

#### Computer Science:
1. \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to low. While the traits like intelligence and puzzle-solving align, the love for nature and animals does not.
2. \( P(H) \): Assume this is around the middle since this field has a moderate proportion of graduate students.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. \( P(E|H) \): High. Strong alignment with the personality traits described.
2. \( P(H) \): Assume this is around the middle as well.

### Posterior Probability:

Using qualitative judgment:
- Given the personality traits align more with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, this will have a notably higher posterior probability.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the strong alignment of personality traits with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science and a moderate mismatch with Computer Science. Adjustments can be made if priors or more specific data on graduate enrollment distribution were known.
