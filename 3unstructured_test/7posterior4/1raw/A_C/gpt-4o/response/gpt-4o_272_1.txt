To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're only comparing hypotheses and not computing absolute probabilities, we can ignore \( P(E) \) (as it is constant for both hypotheses).

Therefore, we focus on the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

1. **Hypothesis 1: Computer Science**

   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\mathrm{cs}}) \) is difficult to ascertain without specific data, but we can assume a reasonable distribution based on graduate enrollments typically seen.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{cs}}) \):
     - High intelligence: Likely (Given a high number of graduate students in Computer Science are typically high achievers).
     - Good at understanding abstract concepts: Very Likely.
     - Empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature: Unlikely compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - Prior probability \( P(H_{\mathrm{avs}}) \) similarly we assume a reasonable distribution.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{avs}}) \):
     - Curiosity about nature and its various plants: Very Likely.
     - Warm heart, strong empathy: Very Likely.
     - Love for animals: Very Likely.
     - High intelligence: Likely (Given a high number of graduate students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science are also high achievers but may not stress abstract concepts as much as Computer Science).

Assuming a rough equal prior probability for both fields (since specific data on graduate enrollments isn't given):

- For Computer Science:
  - \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{cs}}) \): Let's denote it as moderate, around 0.3 implying the interests and personality traits are somewhat aligned but not predominantly.
  - Assuming equal prior, let's arbitrary assume \( P(H_{\mathrm{cs}}) = 0.5 \) for simplification (since exact priors are unknown).
  - Therefore, \( P(H_{\mathrm{cs}}|E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \).

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - \( P(E|H_{\mathrm{avs}}) \): Let's denote it as high, around 0.7 implying the interests and personality traits are predominantly aligned.
  - Assuming equal prior \( P(H_{\mathrm{avs}}) = 0.5 \).
  - Therefore, \( P(H_{\mathrm{avs}}|E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \).

Output in the expected format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```

These values illustrate that based on the given personality sketch, it's more likely Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. However, please keep in mind the precise priors and likelihood values can adjust these computations subtly.
