To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since we lack specific numerical values for these probabilities and considering the qualitative nature of Adam's personality sketch, we can provide a qualitative estimation instead of exact numbers.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**  
This field is somewhat common, so we might assign a reasonable prior.

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his empathy and love for animals, plus his appreciation for hard work and dedication all align well with this field. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is high.

### Computer Science

**Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):**  
This is a popular and common field for graduate students, so we might also assign a moderate to high prior.

**Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):**
Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are strong points for this field. However, his warm heart, empathy, and love for animals are less directly relevant to computer science than to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high but not as high as for the previous field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can assign relative values for each probability.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's characteristics with agricultural and veterinary science, a moderately high alignment with computer science, and the qualitative nature of the evidence along with hypothetical priors.
