To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make qualitative judgments based on the given information. We'll proceed with a reasoned approach given the data we have.

Let's break down the personality sketch and relate it to each field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
  Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits seem to align well with someone who may be interested in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

- **Computer Science:**
  Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, especially in understanding abstract concepts. These traits are well-suited for computer science. However, it is less explicitly connected to his love for nature and animals.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the personality sketch \( E \) supports both hypotheses to some extent, but likely supports agricultural and veterinary science more strongly given the overlap with his interests and traits.

Here's a reasoned estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
These values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science given Adam's interests and personality traits, while still recognizing his intelligence and problem-solving skills which make him a plausible candidate for computer science.
