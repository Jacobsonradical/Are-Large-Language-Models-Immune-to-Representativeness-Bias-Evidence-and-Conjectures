To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that we don't have specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can make informed estimations based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

### Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature, and a strong appreciation for hard workâ€”all of which align well with this field.
   - This gives a high likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam is of high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, and enjoys solving puzzles. These traits are fitting for computer science but less aligned with his noticeable empathy and love for nature.
   - This gives a somewhat moderate likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \).

Since the exact numerical values for priors and likelihoods are not provided, relying on qualitative assessment:

1. \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \) should be relatively high due to the alignment of his empathy, love for animals, and interest in plants with this field.
2. \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \) should be moderate due to his intelligence and problem-solving abilities fitting this field, but less alignment with his love for nature and animals.

### Calculated Posterior Probabilities:
While these are rough qualitative estimates, a reasonable approach based on provided information might yield:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.50
}
```

These values denote the higher probability of Adam being in an agricultural and veterinary science program given his personality sketch, compared to the computer science field. Note that these are subjective estimates given the qualitative nature of the information provided.
