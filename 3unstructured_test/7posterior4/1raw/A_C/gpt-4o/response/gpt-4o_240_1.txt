To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam choosing each field, as well as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given his field of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant.

Since we lack specific data for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, I'll make reasoned assumptions based on Adam's interests and characteristics.

1. **Computer Science:**
    - While Adam's high intelligence and skills in puzzles suggest some fit with computer science, his deep interest in nature, plants, and animals makes this less likely.
    - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.2 \).
    - Assume the general prior probability \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \) (given the popularity of this field).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy fit well with a field focused on agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \).
    - Assume the general prior probability \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \) (considering fewer students generally choose this field compared to computer science).

Because we only focus on these two fields and don't have the denominator \( P(E) \), we'll simply provide the unnormalized probabilities (as they can be compared proportionally):

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
\[ \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]

Therefore, in proportional terms:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.14"
}
```

This suggests that given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, it is more probable that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
