To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific probabilities for these values, we'll be making educated estimates based on the personality sketch and the fields specified. 

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, itâ€™s highly likely he has traits similar to someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's estimate this at approximately 0.8.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability for a graduate student to be in agricultural and veterinary science is rather moderate. We might estimate it to be around 0.1.
- **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: Since Adam's traits could fit several other fields as well, the marginal probability could be moderate. We might estimate it to be around 0.3.

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.27 \]

### 2. Computer Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with traits needed in computer science. However, his love for animals and nature fits this field less perfectly. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.4.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability for a graduate student to be in computer science could be higher given the popularity of the field. Let's estimate it to be around 0.2.
- **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: The marginal probability remains the same. Estimate it at 0.3.

So,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.27 \]

Combining these calculations, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.27",
  "computer science": "0.27"
}
```

Given the limitations of the information, these estimates are rough but hopefully provide a useful illustration of applying Bayes' rule.
