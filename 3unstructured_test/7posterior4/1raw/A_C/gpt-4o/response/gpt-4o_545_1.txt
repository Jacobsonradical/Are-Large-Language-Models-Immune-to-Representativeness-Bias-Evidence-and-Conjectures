To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to update our beliefs about each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field hypothesis, the process involves the following steps:

1. **Estimate the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general likelihood that a graduate student is enrolled in a specific field.
   
2. **Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.

3. **Compute the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This involves summing up the probabilities across all possible fields. However, since we are only comparing two fields here, it will serve as a normalizing constant.

Assumptions for simplicity:
- Assume public data reveals that 15% of graduate students are in computer science and 5% are in agricultural and veterinary science. 
- Assume that Adam's profile is 40% likely if he's in computer science and 90% if he's in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Since we're only comparing these two fields, we can disregard the actual computation of \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant.

Given this information:

### Computer Science
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) = 0.15
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.40 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \) = 0.05
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.90 \)

Let's compute \( P(H|E) \) for these fields:

### Posterior probability for Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
Since \( P(E) \) is unknown and serves as a normalizing constant, denote the formula as follows:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto 0.40 \times 0.15 = 0.06 \]

### Posterior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.90 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

After computing the raw values, we must normalize them:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.045} \approx 0.571 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.06 + 0.045} \approx 0.429 \]

So, the conditional probabilities based on the given evidence are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.571,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.429
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he was enrolled in computer science, but there is still a significant probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
