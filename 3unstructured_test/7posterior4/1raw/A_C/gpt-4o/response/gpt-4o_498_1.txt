To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll first denote the fields:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch of Adam and typical attributes associated with students in these fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H_1)**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and empathy, it's quite likely for him to be in this field.
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): High, because the attributes match well with typical students in this field.
   - \( P(H_1) \): Reasonable prevalence, though less common than some fields like computer science.
   
2. **Computer Science (H_2)**:
   - Adam's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well with computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): High, mainly due to his intelligence and problem-solving.
   - \( P(H_2) \): Very high prevalence as computer science is a popular field.

Using qualitative reasoning:

- \( P(E|H_1) \times P(H_1) \): We assess this moderately high due to the good match in attributes.
- \( P(E|H_2) \times P(H_2) \): We assess this high due to Adam's fit with abstract thinking and puzzle-solving.

Combining this assessment into posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",  // Given the strong match of attributes
  "computer science": "0.8"                   // Given the fit with problem-solving and prevalence
}

The total doesn't add to 1, acknowledging other possible fields Adam could be in.
