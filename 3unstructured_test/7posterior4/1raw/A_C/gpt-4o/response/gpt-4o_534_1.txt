To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to evaluate the likelihood of the given personality sketch \( E \) under different hypotheses \( H \). Here's Bayes' rule for reference:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

As we don't have exact prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field, we need to make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Let's estimate these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \):
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well with typical skills needed in computer science.
     - However, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not particularly relevant to computer science.
   - Prior \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \):
     - Computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - Estimated \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.3 \)
   - Estimated \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.4 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field.
   - Prior \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \):
     - This field is relatively less populated compared to computer science.
   - Estimated \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.8 \)
   - Estimated \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.2 \)

Now, we need to compute \( P(E) \) for normalization:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.3 \cdot 0.4) + (0.8 \cdot 0.2) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.16 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.28 \]

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.4}{0.28} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.28} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \approx 0.4286 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.28} \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.16}{0.28} \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx 0.5714 \]

Now, we can present our findings in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
```

Note that these values are estimations based on the given personality sketch and common characteristics of students in these fields.
