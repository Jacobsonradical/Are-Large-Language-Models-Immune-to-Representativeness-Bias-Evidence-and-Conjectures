To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and the fields, let's denote the hypotheses as follows:
- \( H_{\text{cs}} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{\text{agvs}} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

To proceed with calculations, some assumptions about priors and likelihoods need to be established since we do not have specific data. Let's make some reasonable assumptions about \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \).

**Assumptions about Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
Based on general enrollment trends, let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \) (since computer science is a popular field)
- \( P(H_{\text{agvs}}) = 0.05 \) (since agricultural and veterinary science is less common)

**Assumptions about Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood of him fitting well in each field might be:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \) (since strong intelligence and solving puzzles are relevant but others are less emphasized)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agvs}}) = 0.8 \) (since curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals fit well)

To find \( P(E) \), the marginal probability of evidence \( E \), we sum the products of each hypothesis's likelihood and prior probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agvs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agvs}}) + \cdots \]
For simplification and since other hypotheses are not involved:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.06 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **For Computer Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.1} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.1} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = 0.6 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_{\text{agvs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agvs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agvs}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agvs}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agvs}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.1} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agvs}}|E) = 0.4 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```
