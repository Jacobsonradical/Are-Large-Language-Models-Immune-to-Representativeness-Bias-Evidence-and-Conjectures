To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for several factors: the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood of observing the personality traits described if he were in each field, and how these observations compare across fields. However, we won't be able to provide numerical values without specific data on priors and likelihoods. Instead, we can qualitatively discuss which field seems more likely given the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let's qualitatively evaluate the probabilities:

For Computer Science:
- \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits described (curiosity, high intelligence, understanding abstract concepts) are consistent with someone in computer science. However, the strong empathy and love for animals are not typically highlighted in this field.
- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field, contributing a moderate prior.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H) \): The traits fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science, especially the love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- \( P(H) \): This field is less common than computer science, possibly resulting in a lower prior, though Adam’s traits fit exceptionally well here.

Given these qualitative assessments, \( P(E|H) \) is likely higher for agricultural and veterinary science than for computer science. This leads us to believe that the posterior probability associated with agricultural and veterinary science should be higher.

The values provided are not exact but are informed by our qualitative assessment, reflecting a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science based on Adam’s personality sketch.
