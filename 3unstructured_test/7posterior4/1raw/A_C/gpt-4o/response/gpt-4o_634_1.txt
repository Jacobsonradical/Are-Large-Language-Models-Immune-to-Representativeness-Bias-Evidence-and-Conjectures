To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider three key components for each hypothesis:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field based on general information about graduate students.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Normalization Factor \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume the normalization factor \( P(E) \) is a constant and focus on \(\frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\text{constant}}\). This constant will not influence the relative comparisons between the fields.

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihoods and prior probabilities for both fields considering Adam's traits:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This field generally involves a significant number of students interested in nature, plants, animals, and practical dedication to these areas.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field.
   
3. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Given the strong alignment between Adam's traits and the nature of this field, the posterior probability will be relatively high.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - This field also attracts a significant number of students given the popularity and broad applications of computer science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Traits like high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles fit well with computer science.
   - However, traits such as a deep love for animals and curiosity about nature might not align as strongly.
   
3. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   - Given the partial alignment of Adam's traits with computer science, the posterior probability will be relatively moderate.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here are the likely posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are estimative and may vary upon further detailed analysis including more quantitative data.
