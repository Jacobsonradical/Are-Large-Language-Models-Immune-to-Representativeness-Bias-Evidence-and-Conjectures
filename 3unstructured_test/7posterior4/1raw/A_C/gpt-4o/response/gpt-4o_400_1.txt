To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability, which can be computed as the sum of the likelihoods over all possible hypotheses.

Since we do not have specific values for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the total evidence probability \( P(E) \), we cannot compute exact numerical values. However, we can perform a qualitative analysis to estimate the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Here is a qualitative estimation:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are favorable traits for computer science.
   - Solving puzzles is often associated with problem-solving skills, which are valuable in computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, which strongly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - His warm heart, strong empathy, and dedication to hard work further support an inclination towards fields involving care for living organisms and dedication to studies related to the natural world.

Given these qualitative factors, we can hypothesize the posterior probabilities in a relative sense:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This estimation reflects the alignment of Adam's interests and personality traits more closely with agricultural and veterinary sciences, while also considering that his intelligence and problem-solving skills could make him suited for computer science as well.
