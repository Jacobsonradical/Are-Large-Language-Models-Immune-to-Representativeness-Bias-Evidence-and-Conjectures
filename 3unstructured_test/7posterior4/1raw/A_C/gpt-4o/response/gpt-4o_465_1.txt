To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since exact probabilities are not available, we'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and the fields being considered.

### Assumptions:

1. **P(E)**: Marginal probability of the evidence (Adam's personality). Since we are comparing only two fields, \( P(E) \) will be the same in both calculations, so it will cancel out.

2. **P(H)**: Prior probability of Adam being in a specific field. We'll assume that nationwide, graduate fields like computer science have higher enrollment rates than agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of Adam's personality given the specific field. Given his characteristics:
   - For **computer science**: While intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are relevant, the other attributes (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals) are less related.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: His love for nature and animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work align well.

### Posterior Probabilities:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.2 (prior probability, considering the popularity of the field).
  - \( P(E|H) \): Assume 0.1 (personality less aligned with field).
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): Assume 0.05 (prior probability, less common field).
  - \( P(E|H) \): Assume 0.7 (strong alignment with personality).

Using these assumptions:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common and will cancel out:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.02 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.035 \]

We normalize by comparing these proportional values:

\[ \frac{P(\text{computer science}|E)}{P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E)} = \frac{0.02}{0.035} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

### Final Posterior Probabilities (Approximate Values):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
These values indicate that based solely on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science.
