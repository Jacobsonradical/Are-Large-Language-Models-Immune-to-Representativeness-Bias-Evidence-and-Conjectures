To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of the personality traits given each field. Since this detailed information is not provided, I will give a qualitative assessment based on the information available in the personality sketch and make reasonable assumptions.

Given that Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

We assume that:
1. Personality traits such as a love for nature and animals, empathy, and an appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science (high \( P(E|H_{\text{agr}}) \)).
2. Traits like high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles align reasonably well with computer science (moderate \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)).

However, without explicit priors and exact likelihoods, I suggest educated qualitative estimates on a scale from 0 to 1:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with the nature-focused and empathetic aspects of agricultural and veterinary science and a reasonable connection to the analytical aspects of computer science.
