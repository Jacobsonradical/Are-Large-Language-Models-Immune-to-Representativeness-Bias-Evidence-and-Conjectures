To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam and using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))** for each field: This represents the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: This represents the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant. \( P(E) \) can be computed as the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for all possible hypotheses H.

Given we don't have the exact values for the prior probabilities or likelihoods, I'll provide plausible subjective estimates based on the descriptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior (\( P(H) \)): This field might have a relatively low prior since it's less popular among overall graduate fields.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): High, given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior (\( P(H) \)): Higher than Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences due to the popularity of this field.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): Moderate, since Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are qualities well-suited for computer science.

Given these estimates:
- Let's assume \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is 0.1 and for Computer Science is 0.2.
- For \( P(E|H) \), let's assume that for Agricultural and Veterinary Science it is 0.8 (due to strong relevance) and for Computer Science, it is 0.4 (due to moderate relevance).

Now applying Bayes' rule (without exact \( P(E) \) values, just for comparative purposes):
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

- For Computer Science:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \]

Given the equal contribution from both fields (0.08), the posterior probabilities will be similar, but here are the values between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```
Note: Due to the subjective nature of this exercise and without the exact figures for prior probabilities and likelihoods, these values are educated estimates. Adjustments can be made with more accurate data.
