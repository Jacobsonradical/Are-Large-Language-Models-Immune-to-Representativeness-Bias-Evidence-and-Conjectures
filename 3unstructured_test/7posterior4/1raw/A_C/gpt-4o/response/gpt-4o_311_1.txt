To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we'll need to consider the likelihood of Adam's characteristics being observed given he's enrolled in each field, as well as the prior probabilities of him being enrolled in each field. However, without specific numerical data about those prior probabilities and likelihoods, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the description provided.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability of observing E given that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant (probability of E under all possible hypotheses).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems he has a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and understanding abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with qualities needed for a field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Although Computer Science also requires understanding abstract concepts and problem-solving, the specific mention of nature and animals suggests a higher likelihood of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

For the sake of this qualitative assessment, I will assume:
- The prior probabilities \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{AVS}) \) are roughly similar without detailed data.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is higher than \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) due to the stronger alignment with the nature and animal aspects of Adam's personality.

With this in mind, the posterior probabilities qualitatively are:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values reflect a stronger but not exclusive likelihood towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
