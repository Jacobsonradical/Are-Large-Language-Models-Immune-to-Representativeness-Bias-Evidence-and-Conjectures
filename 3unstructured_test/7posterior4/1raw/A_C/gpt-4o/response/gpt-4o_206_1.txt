To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula for each field, considering prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with each field. 

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and high intelligence:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field. He seems to have a strong inclination towards working with animals and plants.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with computer science. However, his other traits are more strongly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Assuming both fields have equal prior probabilities for simplicity \( P(H) = 0.5 \), and using the traits alignment to estimate \( P(E|H) \):

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high due to the direct alignment of many of Adam's traits.
- For **Computer Science**, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate due to the alignment with intelligence and puzzle-solving but less so with empathy and love for animals.

Then:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Computer Science}} \approx 0.4 \]

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
