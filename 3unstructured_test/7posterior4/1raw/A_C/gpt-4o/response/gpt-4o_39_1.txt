To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science), we will use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E and can be considered as a normalization factor.

Given the nature of Adam's personality sketch and its compatibility with each field, the key estimations we need are \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis and some reasonable prior probabilities \( P(H) \).

Here's one way to approach this:

### Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): High.
   - \( P(H_{ag}) \): Modestly probable; fewer graduates are in this field compared to more popular ones like computer science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators for this field.
   - However, his specific empathy for animals and nature may make it less likely.
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Moderate.
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Very probable, as computer science is a common graduate field.

Without detailed numbers, we could reason as such:
- \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): Around 0.8, given strong alignment with interests.
- \( P(H_{ag}) \): Assume 0.2 as a prior.
- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Around 0.4, somewhat fitting traits but not primarily aligned.
- \( P(H_{cs}) \): Assume 0.5 as a prior.

Normalization factor \( P(E) \) is not specifically needed for comparison.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Given these values, we compute:

\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.16}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2}{P(E)} \]

For comparison, normalize by proportionality:
- For agricultural: 0.16
- For computer science: 0.2

Normalized ratios:
- Sum = 0.16 + 0.2 = 0.36
- \( P(H_{ag}|E) \propto \frac{0.16}{0.36} \approx 0.44 \)
- \( P(H_{cs}|E) \propto \frac{0.2}{0.36} \approx 0.56 \)

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44,
  "computer science": 0.56
}
```

These values reflect the relative compatibilities of Adam's personality sketch with the respective fields, adjusted for the initial prior assumptions.
