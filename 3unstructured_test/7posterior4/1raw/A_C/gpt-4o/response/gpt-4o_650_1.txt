Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability P(H|E) is given by the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, P(E) is a normalization factor and doesn't need to be calculated if we're just comparing the relative probabilities of different hypotheses given the same evidence E. Thus, what we need to compare are the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's denote the following:
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was a computer science student.
- \( P(E|H_\text{AVS}) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was an agricultural and veterinary science student.
- \( P(H_\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(H_\text{AVS}) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H_\text{CS}) \) and \( P(H_\text{AVS}) \) are both 0.5 (i.e., they were equally likely at the start).

Next, we must consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)â€”the probability of observing E given H:
- For computer science: Adam's high intelligence, abstract thinking skills, and puzzle-solving enjoyment point towards computer science but his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature make it less likely.
- For agricultural and veterinary science: His love for animals, appreciation for hard work, warmth, empathy, and curiosity about nature strongly align with this field.

Thus, we can reasonably assume that:
- \( P(E|H_\text{CS}) \): moderate to low, since not all traits strongly align with computer science.
- \( P(E|H_\text{AVS}) \): high, since many traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can express our beliefs:

{
  "computer science": "0.2", 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This expresses our belief that it is more likely Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
