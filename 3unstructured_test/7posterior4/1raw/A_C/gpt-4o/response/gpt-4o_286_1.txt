To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to first establish the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in these fields, and normalize accordingly.

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) are equal for each field due to lack of specific prior information. This assumption can be adjusted if concrete data is available about the distribution of graduate students across different fields. So, \(P(H_{agriculture}) = P(H_{cs})\).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of Adam being in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits (common for normalization but not required for relative comparison).

Based on the personality sketch \(E\):
- Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals aligns strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also fit well with computer science, but the mention of empathy, love for animals, and nature seems to be more directly related to agricultural and veterinary science.

To assign \(P(E|H)\), we consider how likely these traits are to be observed in each respective field:
\[ P(E|H_{agriculture}) > P(E|H_{cs}) \]

Let's assign a higher likelihood for agriculture since Adamâ€™s traits seem more pertinent to this field:
\[ P(E|H_{agriculture}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.3 \]

Given equal priors:
\[ P(H_{agriculture}) = P(H_{cs}) \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be proportionally determined:
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture}) \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) \]

Using proportionality (ignoring \(P(E)\) as consistent for both):
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

Here's the answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities are based on the qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality traits fit each field. For a more precise calculation, one would need detailed statistical data on the distribution of these traits among students of each field.
