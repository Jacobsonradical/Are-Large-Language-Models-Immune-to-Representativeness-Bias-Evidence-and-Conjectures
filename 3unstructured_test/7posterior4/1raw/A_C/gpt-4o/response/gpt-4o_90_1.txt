To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of interest using Bayes' rule, we need some additional probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will need to make some reasonable estimations based on typical characteristics of students in these fields and how they align with Adam's personality sketch.

### Estimations:

**Computer Science**:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): While computer scientists can be curious and intelligent and may enjoy solving puzzles, they are less likely to have a strong focus on nature and animals.
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer Science is a popular graduate field, so this prior might be relatively high.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Given Adam's empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, the likelihood is high for this field.
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This field is less commonly chosen than computer science, so the prior might be lower than for computer science but still significant.

Given Adam's deep love for animals and nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, the field of agricultural and veterinary science seems more aligned with his personality.

Now, let's estimate \( P(H|E) \) qualitatively.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns more closely with a field focused on animals and nature than one dedicated primarily to abstract problem-solving and technology.
