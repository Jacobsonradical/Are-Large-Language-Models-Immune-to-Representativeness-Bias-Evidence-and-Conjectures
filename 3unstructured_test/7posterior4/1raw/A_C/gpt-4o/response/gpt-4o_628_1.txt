To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we lack specific numerical values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll make qualitative estimates based on the information provided.

### Key Information from the Personality Sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Estimating Likelihoods:
Given Adam's traits, we need to estimate how likely Adam would be to exhibit these characteristics if he were in each field. 

- **Computer Science**: Generally, CS students might exhibit high intelligence and problem-solving skills. However, a deep love for animals and nature is less directly relevant.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A passion for nature, plants, and animals is highly relevant. Empathy also aligns well with veterinary work.

### Prior Probabilities:
Assuming no strong prior information about Adamâ€™s likelihood of enrolling in each field, we could start with a general assumption that students might equally likely enroll in any specialization.

Therefore, using qualitative reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and problem-solving align well.
   - Lower relevance of love for animals and nature.
   - Assuming equal prior probabilities.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong alignment with interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Empathy and warm-heartedness are significantly relevant.
   - Assuming equal prior probabilities.

### Estimating Posteriors:
Given the qualitative discussion above, we will argue that if Adam fits well under Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the sketch \( E \), the estimated posterior probability should be higher for this field compared to Computer Science.

### Values:
Note: These values are qualitative and subjective estimates.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect our judgment that the evidence \( E \) is more strongly associated with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Computer Science, given Adam's personality sketch.
