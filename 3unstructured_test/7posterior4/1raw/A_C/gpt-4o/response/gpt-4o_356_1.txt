To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have direct values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). We can make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch and general knowledge.

Assumptions:
1. Adam's described personality traits fit more naturally with agricultural and veterinary science due to his love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy.
2. Computer science could fit his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles despite not being a perfect match for his empathy and love for animals.

Let's assign some hypothetical values for the probabilities based on these assumptions:

- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) might be higher than \( P(E|H_{computer}) \).
- Let's normalize these so that they sum up to 1, giving us a better understanding of their relative likelihoods.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{computer}) = 0.3 \)

And for the sake of simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities for being in either field are equal:
- \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{computer}) = 0.5 \)

The probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant ensuring everything adds up to 1. So:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.5 \]

Now let's compute the posteriors:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the computed values are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
These values provide an estimate based on the given personality traits and assumptions made.
