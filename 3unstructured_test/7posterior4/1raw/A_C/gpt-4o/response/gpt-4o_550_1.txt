To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand Bayes' Rule result:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since actual statistical data for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) aren't provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. This is a qualitative assessment designed to capture the gist rather than exact numerical values.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The field has a high number of graduate students in the U.S.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits such as high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, a strong love for animals and appreciation of nature are less directly relevant.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field has fewer graduate students compared to computer science, but still significant.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's love for nature, empathy, and love for animals fit very closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative observations:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) > P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) > P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)

Using rough qualitative estimation, we can say that the posterior for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher because the match between the evidence and the field is more specific despite the higher prior for "computer science."

So, our rough qualitative estimation might look something like:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

This illustrates that given Adam's personality characteristics, he is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science. However, it's important to note that these values are heuristic as exact calculations would require more precise statistical data.
