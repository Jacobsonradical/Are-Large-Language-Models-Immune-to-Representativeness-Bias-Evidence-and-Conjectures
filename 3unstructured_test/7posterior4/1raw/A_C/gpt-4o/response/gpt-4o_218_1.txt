To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, since we do not have the exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will qualitatively reason about them based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam’s personality sketch \( E \):
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts might be a plus for both fields.
- A genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals strongly favor agricultural and veterinary science.
- Quiet boy enjoying solving puzzles could somewhat favor computer science but is not a strong indicator.
- Strong empathy and warm heart might also lean toward fields involving animals and nature.

Let's qualitatively assign approximate likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \): Moderate to low, solving puzzles and high intelligence are factors, but no strong indicators related to nature or empathy.
   - Let's assume this probability qualitatively around 0.3.
   - Prior \( P(H_{computer science}) \): Let's assume a moderate prior, around 0.5, because of the popularity of the field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): High, strong interest in nature, love for animals, empathy all strongly point here.
   - Let's assume this probability qualitatively around 0.8.
   - Prior \( P(H_{agricultural}) \): Let's assume a lower prior compared to computer science, around 0.2, because fewer people might choose this specialization.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

For qualitative purposes, we do not need the normalization constant, as we are comparing similar fields. Here are the resulting probabilities:

\[
P(H_{computer science}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15
\]
\[
P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
\]

Considering these qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.16"
}
```

These values reflect a slightly higher posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary science over computer science based on the personality sketch provided.
