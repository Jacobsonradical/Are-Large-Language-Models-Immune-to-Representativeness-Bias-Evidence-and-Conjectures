To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\) and the prior probability of \(H\). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

where:

- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence E.

Since we lack specific prior probabilities and exact likelihoods, we'll proceed with qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Given Adam's deep curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume a relatively higher prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Given this field aligns well with Adam's interests in nature and animals, the likelihood of observing his traits if he is in this field would be high.

Therefore, without specific numerical values, this results in a higher posterior probability.

### Computer Science:

- **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Computer science could have a lower prior probability compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, as it requires different primary interests.

- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The fact that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence plus a good grasp of abstract concepts partly matches the traits necessary for computer science. However, there is less alignment with his expressed love for nature and animals.

Thus, the posterior probability for Computer Science would be lower than for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Based on these qualitative considerations, the conditional probabilities might be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note these values are illustrative and based on qualitative reasoning rather than a precise calculation due to the lack of specific numerical data.
