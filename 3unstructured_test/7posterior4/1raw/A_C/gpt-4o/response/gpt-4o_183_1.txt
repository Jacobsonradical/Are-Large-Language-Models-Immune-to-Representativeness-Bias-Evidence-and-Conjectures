To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of seeing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, we will make informed estimates based on the description of Adam's personality sketch. 

1. **Computer Science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be well-suited to this field. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals do not directly align with the typical profile of a Computer Science student.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) for Computer Science: Considering Adam is in the U.S., Computer Science is a common and popular field, so the prior probability might be relatively high.
   - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be moderately high, but not extremely high. Let's assume an approximate value of 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals perfectly align with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: This field would be less common than Computer Science but not rare. Considering the niche fit with Adam's interests, we'll estimate this prior to be moderately high.
   - Therefore, we estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be very high. Let's assume an approximate value of 0.8.

Given these considerations, and without specific numbers for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can provide rough qualitative estimates:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
