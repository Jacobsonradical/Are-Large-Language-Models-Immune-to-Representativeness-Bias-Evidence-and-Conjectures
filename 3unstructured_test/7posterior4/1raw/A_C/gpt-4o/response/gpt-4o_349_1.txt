Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (evidence), which can be calculated as the sum of the product of the likelihood and prior over all hypotheses.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make educated guesses about the likelihoods and priors for the given fields. However, without specific statistical data, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the description:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with being a computer science graduate student.
     - Enjoys solving puzzles.
     - Of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.4 \).

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a U.S. graduate student being in computer science. Assuming an approximate percentage of graduate students enrolled in computer science programs.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits aligning with being an agricultural and veterinary science graduate student.
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
     - Strong empathy and deep love for animals.
     - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{avs}) = 0.7 \).

   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a U.S. graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming a lower percentage compared to computer science.
   - Let's estimate \( P(H_{avs}) = 0.05 \).

3. **Total probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - Since we are interested in relative comparisons for the two given fields, we can normalize our results accordingly if needed.

Let's compute the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will be a normalizing factor, we focus on the numerator part:

- For computer science:
  \[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.15 = 0.06 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(H_{avs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Normalizing (assuming these are the only two fields for simplicity):
\[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.035} \approx 0.63 \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.06 + 0.035} \approx 0.37 \]

However, the instruction says the total does not need to add up to 1. Correcting for that, we use unnormalized values directly:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.035
}
```

This should represent their relative likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch and our reasonable assumptions.
