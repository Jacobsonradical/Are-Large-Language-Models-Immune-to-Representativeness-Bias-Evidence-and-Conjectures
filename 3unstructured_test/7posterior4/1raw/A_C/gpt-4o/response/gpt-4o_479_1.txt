To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to apply:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without detailed information on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it's reasonable to assume he might be more inclined towards agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. He enjoys solving puzzles, which also fits with computer science, but the mentioned traits are more emphatically aligned with the former field.

Let's make some reasonable qualitative assumptions:
- Assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is higher given his traits.
- Assume the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is also higher for agricultural and veterinary science given his deep interest in nature and animals.

Based on these qualitative assumptions, the posterior probabilities might be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are not computed rigorously but are assumed based on the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with the fields described. The actual numerical values would require detailed data about the distribution of personality traits across graduate fields, which we donâ€™t have access to here.
