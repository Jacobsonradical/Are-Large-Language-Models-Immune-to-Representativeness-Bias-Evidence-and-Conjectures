To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have exact numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \). However, we can make some qualitative estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and his likely interests.

First, let's break down the components qualitatively:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: There is a substantial number of graduate students in computer science in the U.S., so the prior is reasonably high.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field has fewer students compared to computer science, so the prior is relatively lower but not negligible.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Computer Science**: Adam's love for solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature is less typical for this field.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the same for both and often cancels out in comparative posterior probabilities.

Thus, qualitatively:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate to high due to puzzle-solving and intelligence.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High due to curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.

Now qualitatively estimating the posterior probabilities:

\[
\begin{cases}
  \text{computer science} \approx 0.3 \\
  \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \approx 0.7 \\
\end{cases}
\]

This suggests Adamâ€™s characteristics and interests are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science.

Therefore, the final estimate in the specified format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
