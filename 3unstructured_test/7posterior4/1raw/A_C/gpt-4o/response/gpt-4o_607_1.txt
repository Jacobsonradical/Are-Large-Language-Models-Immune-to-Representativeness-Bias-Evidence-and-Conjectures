In order to compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch (E), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch overall.

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we cannot compute an exact numerical posterior probability. Instead, we can make a qualitative assessment of these probabilities. 

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s interest in nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is high.
- \( P(H) \): This is less certain but let's assume graduate students in agricultural and veterinary sciences are less common compared to fields like computer science.
- Overall, \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science would be moderately high due to the strong alignment of his interests and personality traits.

### Computer Science
- \( P(E|H) \): While Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, the lack of mention of direct interest in technology or computers makes \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \) moderate.
- \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field for graduate study, so \( P(H_{computer science}) \) is relatively high.
- Thus, \( P(H|E) \) for computer science might be considerable but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science due to the mismatched interests in nature and animals.

Given the qualitative assessment and understanding, the probabilities can be expressed as follows, with the realization that exact values are not being provided due:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

Please note these values are illustrative and based on qualitative assessment rather than precise calculation. The exact application would require actual data to compute \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).
