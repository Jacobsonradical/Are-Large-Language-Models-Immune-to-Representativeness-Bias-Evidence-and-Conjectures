To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's potential fields of study using Bayes' rule, we need some prior information, such as the base rates (priors) for graduate students in these fields and the likelihood of possessing the traits and interests described in \( E \) within these fields. Since those data points are not provided, I will make reasoned assumptions to demonstrate the calculation:

### Assumptions:
- Let \( P(H_1) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Let \( P(H_2) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in computer science.
- Without specific data, I'll assume these are roughly equal given the diverse interests graduate students can have.

Let \( P(E|H_1) \) be the probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
Let \( P(E|H_2) \) be the probability of observing Adam's traits given he is in computer science.

### Estimations:
- Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals and values hard work and dedication, aligning more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with both fields, but quiet, empathetic tendencies might slightly weigh more towards the sciences dealing with living entities.

Assume \( P(H_1) = 0.2 \) and \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \) due to equal distribution of graduate students across diverse fields without specific data.

Assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.7 \) and \( P(E|H_2) = 0.3 \) based on his traits matching agricultural and veterinary science more.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

So,
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 + 0.06 = 0.2 \]

Now calculate the posteriors:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Note: These probabilities are based on assumed values and illustrate the process. Actual probabilities would require data specific to the population of graduate students in these fields and a more detailed personality model.
