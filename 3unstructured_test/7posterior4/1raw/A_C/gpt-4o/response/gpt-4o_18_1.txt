To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since you haven't provided specific values for prior probabilities or likelihoods, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

### Assumptions:
1. **Priors \( P(H) \)**: Assume the prior probabilities of each field are equally likely.
2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: The observed personality sketch (E) will influence these.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Likelihood is higher because the subject has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding, and appreciation for the work involved.
   - Computer Science: While the subject enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent and good at abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science, other aspects like a deep love for animals and nature play lesser roles here.

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High (let's use a value of 0.7 to represent a higher likelihood)
- For Computer Science: Moderate (let's use a value of 0.3 to represent a moderate likelihood)

### Priors \( P(H) \):
- As a simplifying assumption, let's assume the prior probabilities are equal. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for both fields (since priors are not specified and assuming simplicity).

### Evidence \( P(E) \):
- P(E) normalizes the probabilities but isn't directly needed to compare them.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our comparison, \( P(E) \) remains the same for both, so we focus on the numerators:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

Given these proportions, we can compare the relative likelihoods. Here are the results in the proper format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

Please note that these values are based on the assumed likelihoods and priors. Actual probabilities could vary with different assumptions or additional data.
