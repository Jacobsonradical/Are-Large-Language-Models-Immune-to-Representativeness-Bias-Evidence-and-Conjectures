To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we are not given the exact numerical probabilities for each component, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to provide estimates. We need to make educated guesses based on the personality sketch \( E \) and the general traits associated with each field.

### Computer Science

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest fields more closely related to the natural world. While intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are valuable in computer science, the other aspects of his personality seem less directly related to this field.

**Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a popular graduate field with many students enrolled, so it's common.

**Estimated \( P(E|H) \)**: Given that qualities like strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature are less emphasized in computer science, but intelligence and puzzle-solving are crucial:
- \( P(E|H) \) (Computer Science) might be low to moderate.

**Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Combining the above qualitative assessments:
- \( P(H|E) \approx 0.15 \)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align closely with agricultural and veterinary science.

**Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field is less populated than computer science but aligns closely with Adam's interests and qualities.

**Estimated \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his qualities fit well with this field:
- \( P(E|H) \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science) might be high.

**Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Combining the above qualitative assessments:
- \( P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \)

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80
}
```
