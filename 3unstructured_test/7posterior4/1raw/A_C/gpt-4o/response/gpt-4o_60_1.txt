Sure, to find the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis about the field in which Adam was enrolled, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the terms:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** This is the initial probability of each hypothesis before considering the personality sketch \( E \). Without specific data on the distribution of graduate fields, we might assume a prior probability based on general enrollment statistics.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is the probability of observing the personality traits given the specific field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):** This is the overall probability of observing the personality traits, summing over all fields. Since we are looking for a comparative measure, we do not need to explicitly calculate this and can focus on the relative likelihoods and priors.

Given the qualitative nature of the problem, we will make some reasonable assumptions:

- For **computer science**, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) would be somewhat moderate because while high intelligence and puzzle-solving are common in CS, strong empathy and love for nature are less indicative.
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \) would be higher because a love for animals, nature, and empathy strongly align with this field.

Now, let us assume the prior probabilities roughly:

- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.3 \) (assuming computer science is a fairly popular field)
- \( P(H_{\text{AV}}) = 0.1 \) (assuming agricultural and veterinary science is less common)

We'll estimate likelihoods based on how well the personality sketch matches typical traits for each field:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \) (intelligence and puzzles fit well, but empathy and nature are less typical)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \approx 0.8 \) (fits very well given empathy, love for animals, and nature)

Using these estimates in Bayes' rule, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

To normalize these (though not strictly necessary for relative comparison):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.12 + 0.08 = 0.2 \]
 
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.2} = 0.6
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4
\]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities might be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

These values indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to be enrolled in computer science (though not overwhelmingly) compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
