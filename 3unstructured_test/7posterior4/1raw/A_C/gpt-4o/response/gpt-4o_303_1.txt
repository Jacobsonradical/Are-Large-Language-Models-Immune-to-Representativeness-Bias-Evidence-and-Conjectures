To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make a qualitative estimate of these probabilities based on the information given.

Assumptions:
1. The personality sketch \( E \) is more strongly indicative of fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem solving.
2. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of enrolling in a given field, could be assumed to be relatively even across graduate fields, but this requires an estimate based on common enrollment statistics or domain-specific intuition.
3. \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field, can be roughly estimated higher for fields aligned with Adam's interests and traits.

For a rough estimation, let's consider:

- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high because Adam's interests and traits align very well with this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is moderate, given that Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, but it is not as perfect a fit as agricultural and veterinary science in terms of his love for nature and animals.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's estimate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values are arbitrary and based on qualitative reasoning; actual probabilities would require more specific data on prior enrollment rates and personality alignments per field.
