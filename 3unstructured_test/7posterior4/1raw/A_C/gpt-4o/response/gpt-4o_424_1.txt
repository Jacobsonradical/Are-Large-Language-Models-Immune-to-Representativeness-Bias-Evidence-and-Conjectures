To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need the following information:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I will make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam, which matches certain characteristics more closely with certain fields. This will allow us to discuss the relative probabilities rather than exact numerical values.

### Assumptions:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns strongly with the personality sketch of Adam, especially given his appreciation for nature, plants, and animals.
  - \( P(E|H_{agricultural\_veterinary}) \): Higher, as his interests and traits fit well with this field.
  - \( P(H_{agricultural\_veterinary}) \): Moderate. This is a specialized field, so fewer graduate students might be in this field compared to broader fields like computer science.
  
- **Computer Science**: This field is broad and involves problem-solving and understanding abstract concepts, which also fits parts of the personality sketch of Adam.
  - \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \): Moderate to high, as his intelligence and problem-solving skills are a good match, but his love for nature and animals is less relevant.
  - \( P(H_{computer\_science}) \): High, given the popularity and broad application of this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we'll assign relative probabilities (keeping totals less than 1):

**Posterior Conditional Probabilities:**
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values indicate a higher likelihood for Adam to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to better alignment with his personality traits, but also a significant probability for Computer Science due to his problem-solving abilities and high intelligence. Note that these values are qualitative estimates rather than precise calculations.
