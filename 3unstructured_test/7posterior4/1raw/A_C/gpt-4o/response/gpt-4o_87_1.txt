To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we have to estimate them qualitatively based on the details provided and typical characteristics of students in those fields.

### Estimations Based on Given Information

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): For computer science, while intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are highly relevant, the strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not strongly associated with the typical characteristics of computer science students.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science is a popular field, so the prior probability might be high.
   - \( P(E) \): This is the same for all fields and can be considered a normalizing constant.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam’s interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work are highly relevant and suggest he might fit well in this field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): This field might have a lower base rate compared to computer science, but Adam’s characteristics harmonize well with this field's typical profiles.
   - \( P(E) \): Same normalizing constant as above.

Given the qualitative nature of our estimation, we can make a reasoned guess about the posterior probabilities. The exact numerical values are subject to interpretation, but we can propose a relative scale based on the analytical reasoning:

### Proposed Posterior Conditional Probabilities

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}
```

These values reflect:
- **Higher likelihood** that Adam’s personality sketch makes him a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Lower likelihood** but still possible, that he might be in computer science due to some relevant traits.
