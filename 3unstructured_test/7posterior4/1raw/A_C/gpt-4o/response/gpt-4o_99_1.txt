Given the information provided, we need to apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To estimate these probabilities, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality traits (E) given each field (H), as well as the prior probabilities of each field and the probability of observing E in general. 

Let’s make some informed approximations for these values. Note that these are heuristic estimates since we do not have exact numerical data.

For the field of agricultural and veterinary science:
- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is reasonable to estimate a high likelihood that he is in this field. Let's assume \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) to be 0.7.
- The prior probability \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) can be approximated based on the distribution of graduate students in this field. Assuming there's a relatively moderate number of students in this specific specialization, let’s set \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) to 0.1.

For the field of computer science:
- Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, it is reasonable to assume a moderately high likelihood that he is in computer science. Let’s assume \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\) to be 0.5.
- The prior probability \(P(H_{\text{computer science}})\) can be estimated based on the popularity of this field. Given the high number of students in computer science, let’s set \(P(H_{\text{computer science}})\) to 0.3.

To complete our calculations, we need an estimate for \( P(E) \), the probability of Adam's profile in general. Given the diversity of graduate fields and that we don't have exact numbers:

\[ P(E) \approx \sum_i P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

For simplicity, assume \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

 Using these values:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} = 0.75 \]

Let's normalize these probabilities to better reflect them as percentages of certainty for ease of interpretation:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.32,
  "computer science": 0.68
}
\]

This normalization ensures that our consideration better follows the proportion of estimates. The values indicate higher likelihood towards "computer science" but still a considerable chance for "agricultural and veterinary science." This sketch reflects an informed estimation given provided heuristics.
