To use Bayes' Rule to calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we will make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch \( E \).

### Prior Probabilities

- \( P(\text{computer science}) \): This is the probability that any given graduate student is studying computer science. In the U.S., computer science is a common graduate field, but not the most common.
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): This field is less commonly pursued as a graduate discipline compared to computer science but is typically undertaken by those with a strong interest in nature and animals, much like Adam.

### Likelihoods

- \( P(E | \text{computer science}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting someone in computer science. While intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles are common traits among computer science students, the strong connection to nature and animals is less typical.
- \( P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch fitting someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Given Adam's love for nature and animals, this match seems quite strong.

### Posterior Probabilities

- **Computer Science \( P(\text{computer science} | E) \)**: Given the personality traits, while some align well with a computer science background (e.g., solving puzzles, high intelligence), the deep empathy and love for animals are less aligned. Thus, the posterior probability would be moderate but not very high.
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) \)**: Adam's traits are strongly aligned with this field, including his love for nature, animals, and his empathy. Thus, the posterior probability here would be quite high.

Based on this qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Please note that these numerical values are rough estimates based on qualitative assessment and typical profiles of students in these fields.
