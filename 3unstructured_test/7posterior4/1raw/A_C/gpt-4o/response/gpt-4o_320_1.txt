To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given the respective fields and the prior probabilities of being enrolled in these fields. Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we lack concrete numerical data for these values, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, the traits like a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work are highly relevant.
   - For computer science, traits like being good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant.

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Graduate students are more likely to be found in popular and broad fields like computer science.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science might have fewer students compared to computer science.

Given these assumptions, let's assign some qualitative likelihoods and priors.

### Qualitative Likelihoods:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood due to strong relevance of traits)
- **Computer science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{comp}}) \approx 0.6 \) (moderate likelihood due to relevance, but not all traits are directly related)

### Qualitative Priors:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.1 \) (few graduate students in this field)
- **Computer science**:
  - \( P(H_{\text{comp}}) \approx 0.3 \) (more graduate students in this field)

Since we don't have exact data for \( P(E) \), we'll compute values based on our qualitative judgment and normalization for simplicity.

### Computation:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

- **Computer science**:
\[
P(H_{\text{comp}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{comp}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp}}) \approx 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18
\]

After computing these values, we normalize them relatively (optional for this specific problem but shown for clarity):

\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.26} \approx 0.31
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{comp}}|E) = \frac{0.18}{0.08 + 0.18} \approx \frac{0.18}{0.26} \approx 0.69
\]

Given that the probabilities should add up to 1 across the two fields considered here (ignoring the marginalized outside fields), we could directly use the unnormalized values since the request explicitly states the total doesn't need to be 1 (just relative proportions).

Thus:
```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.18
}
```

This provides relative emphasis based on our qualitative assessment.
