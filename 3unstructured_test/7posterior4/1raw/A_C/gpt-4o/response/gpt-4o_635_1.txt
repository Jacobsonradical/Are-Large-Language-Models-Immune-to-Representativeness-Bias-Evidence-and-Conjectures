To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following factors:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence E given that the hypothesis H is true.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence E.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have the exact numerical values to plug into Bayes' rule, we can qualitatively assess how likely Adam is to be in each of the mentioned fields given his personality traits.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is highly conceivable that he may have opted for a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Although Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant traits for computer science, there is no mention of an interest in technology or computer-related activities in the personality sketch. However, his quiet nature and problem-solving skills do not rule out this field entirely.

Considering these qualitative assessments, let's assign probabilities within the range [0, 1] while noting that these assessments are subjective rather than based on statistical data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // High probability given the fit with his personality traits
  "computer science": 0.3  // Moderate probability, since some of his traits are relevant but there's no direct indication of interest in the field itself
}
```

These probabilities reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam's traits are more strongly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science but do not completely rule out computer science.
