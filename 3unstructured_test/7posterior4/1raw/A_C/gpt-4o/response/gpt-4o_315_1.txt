To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "agricultural and veterinary science" and "computer science" given the personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the prior probability of the personality sketch \( E \), but since we are only comparing two hypotheses, we can consider it as a normalizing constant, which will be the same for both fields.

We don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, so we'll make reasoned qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Prior probability \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): This field is less common compared to more popular fields like computer science, so the prior might be lower.
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Adam's interests, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work make it quite likely that he would pursue a field closely related to nature and animals.

### Computer Science
- Prior probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \): This is a very popular field among graduate students, so the prior might be higher.
- Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \): While Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at solving puzzles (traits beneficial in computer science), his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are less typical for this field.

Given these considerations, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** is quite aligned with Adam's interests and personality traits, making it a strong candidate. Despite a potentially lower prior, the specific likelihood given his traits is high.
- **Computer Science** has a higher base rate in general among graduate students, but the specific fit with Adam's detailed personality sketch is lower than the fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Thus, based on the qualitative information provided about Adam and using Bayes' rule in a reasoned manner, we estimate the above posterior probabilities.
