To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need some auxiliary information such as prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Given that we lack specific statistical data, we'll need to make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's total probability, which normalizes the distribution.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), let's qualitatively assess the likelihoods:

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He has a strong appreciation for hard work (which aligns with the labor-intensive nature of agricultural and veterinary fields).

   From these, it seems very likely that \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
   - He has high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (both qualities are conducive for computer science).

   While these qualities align with computer science, the passion for nature and animals suggests a stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is somewhat lower than for agricultural and veterinary sciences.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)
This depends on the general prevalence of students in each field. Assuming the number of students in these fields is somewhat balanced but higher in technical fields like computer science in the U.S., we assign slightly higher prior probabilities for computer science.

### Posterior Probabilities
Using our qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are educated guesses based on the given personality sketch and typical priors. Further statistical data could refine these estimates.
