Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the description provided.

- **Computer Science:**
  Given Adam's intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, it is plausible that he might be enrolled in computer science. However, his love for nature, plants, and animals might make it less likely compared to the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
  
  Let's estimate:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4
  \]
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2
  \]
  
  Assuming these are qualitative estimates and without calculating \( P(E) \):
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
  \]
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  Given Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he is enrolled in this field.
  
  Let's estimate:
  \[
  P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.7
  \]
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.2
  \]
  
  Assuming these are qualitative estimates and without calculating \( P(E) \):
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \approx 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14
  \]

Thus, the probabilities can be qualitatively estimated as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14
}
```
