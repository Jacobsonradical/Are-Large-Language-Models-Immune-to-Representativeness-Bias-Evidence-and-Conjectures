To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). However, in this query, no specific prior probabilities or likelihoods are provided. Therefore, making an estimate without concrete data will involve some assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability (the probability of hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\))
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood (the probability of the evidence \(E\) given that hypothesis \(H\) is true)
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability (the initial probability of hypothesis \(H\))
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood (the probability of the evidence \(E\))

Since the prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) and the marginal likelihood (\(P(E)\)) are not given, I'll assume these are uniform and focus on the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), which we can estimate based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, it's highly likely he would be interested in a field involving these elements.
   - Therefore, \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) is relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which aligns with the skills often required in computer science.
   - Therefore, \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})\) is also reasonably high, but perhaps not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science given the stronger alignment with his passion for nature and animals.

Taking these into consideration and making an educated guess:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the given personality sketch, not on precise calculations with exact prior and likelihood probabilities. Adjustments would be necessary with more detailed data.
