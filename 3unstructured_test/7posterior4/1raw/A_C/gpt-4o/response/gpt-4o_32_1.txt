To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being in each of these fields, the likelihood of the personality sketch given the fields, and the overall evidence. Given that specific values for the priors and likelihoods are not provided, we can make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we assume the following:
1. \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of Adam choosing each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) represents the likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is in each field.
3. \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which is the same for both fields in the comparison.

Let's reason through the likelihoods:
- **Computer Science**: This field often values high intelligence and abstract thinking, which fits with Adam's qualities of high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts. However, having a deep love for animals and strong empathy might not be as strongly correlated with computer science as with another field.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are critical for someone studying plants and animals in a hands-on manner.

Based on these assessments, we can assign approximate likelihood values (this is a subjective estimation without specific numbers):

- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science: Moderate to high (let’s estimate around 0.4)
- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science: High (let’s estimate around 0.7)

We also assume that the priors \( P(H) \) are roughly even for simplicity (each at 0.5, assuming only these two fields were in consideration). 

Using these values, we can estimate:

- For **computer science**:
\[ P(\text{H|E})_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2}{P(E)} \]

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{H|E})_{\text{AgVet}} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.35}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing these probabilities and not calculating absolute values, we focus on the ratios:
\[ P(\text{H|E})_{\text{AgVet}} \gg P(\text{H|E})_{\text{CS}} \]

Normalizing these for comparison (where \( P(E) \) cancels out):
\[ 
\text{Relative weight for computer science}: 0.4 \\
\text{Relative weight for agricultural and veterinary science}: 0.7
\]

Converting these into relative probabilities (ensuring they sum to 1 within the scope of the chosen fields):
\[ 
\sum \text{weights} = 0.4 + 0.7 = 1.1 \\
P(\text{H|E})_{\text{CS}} = \frac{0.4}{1.1} \approx 0.36 \\
P(\text{H|E})_{\text{AgVet}} = \frac{0.7}{1.1} \approx 0.64 
\]

Therefore, the computed probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
These values express that given the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science.
