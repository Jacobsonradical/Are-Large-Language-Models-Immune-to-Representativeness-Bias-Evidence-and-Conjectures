To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, the prior probability of the hypothesis, and the overall probability of the evidence. Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the description given.

Given the information about Adam's personality and interests, let's assess the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - The personality sketch indicates a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work, all of which are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract concepts are relevant to computer science, but there is less mention of a direct connection to his curiosity about nature and love for animals. 

Thus, we expect the probability to be higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, given the evidence \(E\).

**Posterior Conditional Probabilities (qualitative, given current information):**

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of Adam's interests and personality with each field. The exact numerical probabilities would require more detailed information on the base rates and likelihoods.
