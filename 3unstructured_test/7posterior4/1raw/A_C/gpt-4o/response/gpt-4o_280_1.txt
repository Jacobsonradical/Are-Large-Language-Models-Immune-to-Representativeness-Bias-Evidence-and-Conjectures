To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Nonetheless, because the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probabilities of Adam being in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality) are not provided, I'll make educated guesses based on the provided personality traits.

Here, Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E) \), it is impossible to calculate exact probabilities. Instead, we will estimate based on the compatibility of his traits with each field.

1. **Computer Science (CS):**
    - Pros: High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles.
    - Cons: Interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly align with CS.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
    - Pros: Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, strong empathy.
    - Cons: Less directly aligned with intellectual abstraction and puzzle solving compared to CS.

Given these considerations, we can hypothesize that the probability is likely higher for agricultural and veterinary science due to his strong affinities towards nature and animals. However, the traits of high intelligence and solving puzzles suggest that computer science is still a plausible field.

Hence, the estimated probabilities could be:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

This rough estimation reflects that Adam's personality traits are more aligned with AVS, but the abstract thinking and puzzle-solving nature also relate significantly to CS.
