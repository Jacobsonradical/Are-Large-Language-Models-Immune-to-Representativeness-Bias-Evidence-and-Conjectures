To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, the exact posterior probabilities cannot be determined. Instead, I'll make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch provided and general knowledge about the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

### Fields:
1. Computer Science
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

### Estimates:

1. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - **Computer Science**:
     - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts match computer science traits.
     - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related.
     - Empathy and warm heart are less specific to computer science but can be present.
   
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals are strong matches.
     - Warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for dedication are highly relevant.
     - High intelligence is applicable across most fields, including this one.

2. **Priors \( P(H) \):**
   - Based on typical graduate program distributions, computer science programs are more numerous than agricultural and veterinary science programs.
   - However, we don't have exact numbers, so we'll use rough priors.

Given these considerations, we can make qualitative assessments to approximate the posterior probabilities.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Computer Science**:
  - While Adam has some traits that match well, the more specific interests in nature and animals make it less likely.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Adam's traits strongly align with this field, making it more likely.

These values are rough estimates based on qualitative analysis. Actual values would require precise priors and likelihoods based on empirical data.
