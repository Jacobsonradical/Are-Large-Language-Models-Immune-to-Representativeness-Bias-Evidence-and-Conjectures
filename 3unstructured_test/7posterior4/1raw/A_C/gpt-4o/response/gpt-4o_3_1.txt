To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we do not have actual numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can qualitatively estimate based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of graduate students in the two fields.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \):
     - Curiosity about abstract concepts: strong relation.
     - Enjoying puzzles: likely.
     - Warm heart and empathy: not strongly typical but not detrimental.
     - Love for animals: unrelated.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): relatively common.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{Ag})} )\):
     - Curiosity about nature and plants: strong relation.
     - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: very strong relation.
     - Enjoying puzzles: not essential but helpful.
     - Understanding hard work and dedication: very typical.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{Ag})} ) \): less common compared to CS but not rare.

Qualitative Estimation:
- Given the strong connections in personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, the posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary sciences should be higher. 

Estimating posteriors with qualitative analysis:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{Ag}}|E) \approx 0.8 \]

Here is the result in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These are qualitative estimates intended for illustrative purposes. Exact values would require specific numerical priors and likelihoods for each hypothesis.
