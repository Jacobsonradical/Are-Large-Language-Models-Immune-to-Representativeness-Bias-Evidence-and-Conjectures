To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probability of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of his personality traits (E) given that he is in that field. However, without specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can't provide exact probabilities. Instead, we will use the given information to make qualitative assessments.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make the following qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(H1):** This should be reasonably high given Adam's strong love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - **P(E|H1):** The likelihood of exhibiting Adam's personality traits given that he is in this field should also be high because the traits align closely with interests in this field.

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - **P(H2):** This could be more moderate. While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well with computer science, other aspects like a strong love for nature and animals are not directly aligned.
   - **P(E|H2):** The likelihood of Adam having these personality traits given that he is in computer science should be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science, because his other traits don't have a strong connection to this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments we get a relative sense of \(P(H_1|E)\) and \(P(H_2|E)\). 

Here is the expected value range:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
```

These values imply that based on Adam's personality traits, it is more likely that he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Computer Science. The exact probabilities would require specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
