To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), the priors \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, given the limited context and without the actual likelihood or prior probability values, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch and general knowledge about the fields.

1. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam's traits of high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are quite relevant to computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals is not directly related. Let's assume a moderate likelihood.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science is a popular field with a significant number of graduate students. Based on general trends, let’s assume a prior representing medium probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work align closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, this likelihood is quite high.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to computer science. Assuming a smaller pool of students, let’s assume a lower prior probability.

Even with these assumptions, this is still a hypothetical estimation:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Though \( P(E) \) remains constant for both hypotheses, we can still compare the relative probabilities.

Given that:

- Likelihood for CS is moderate: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \)
- Prior for CS is medium: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Likelihood for AVS is high: \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- Prior for AVS is lower: \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \)

Using these values, the calculations could look something like:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.2}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

The posterior probabilities would be:

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} = 0.08C
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{P(E)} = 0.08C
\]

Ultimately, we can observe that both posteriors here might actually turn out to be very similar. To reflect this in a simpler form without exact values for all factors, the estimated probabilities can be given as:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.1 to 0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.2 to 0.3"
}
```

This acknowledges the stronger relevance of Adam's personality traits to agricultural and veterinary science while still considering his traits that align with computer science but recognizing the different priors for both fields.
