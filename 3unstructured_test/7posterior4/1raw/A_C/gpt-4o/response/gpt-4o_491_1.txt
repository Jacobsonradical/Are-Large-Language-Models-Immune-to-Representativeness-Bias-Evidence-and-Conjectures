To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field.**
2. **Identify the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.**
3. **Apply Bayes' rule:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we'll need to make educated estimations based on the information provided.

### Estimations:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** We’ll assume equal prior probability for simplicity unless stated otherwise.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** We need to evaluate how much the evidence fits with the description of each field.

#### Initial assumptions for prior probabilities:

- **Computer Science:** Generally, many students are enrolled in this field; let’s assume a prior probability of \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field is less common than computer science; let’s assume a prior probability of \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

#### Estimations for likelihoods based on evidence \( E \):

- **P(E|H), where H = computer science:** Adam's empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and solving puzzles:
  - Curiosity about nature and understanding abstract concepts fit moderately well with computer science: Say \( P(E|H) = 0.3 \).

- **P(E|H), where H = agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam's love for animals and nature fits very well:
  - This evidence is highly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science: Say \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).

#### Estimations for Posterior Probability:

We don't have the exact value for \( P(E) \), the prior probability of observing evidence, but since it is constant for both calculations, it can be ignored when comparing ratios directly.

### Using Bayes' rule:

#### Computer Science
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)}
\]
Estimating,
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15
\]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]
Estimating,
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = 0.21
\]

### Normalized values:

We can normalize the values if required, but since we need the values between 0 and 1, and it says the total does not need to add up to 1, we'll use these estimations directly:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21
}
\]
