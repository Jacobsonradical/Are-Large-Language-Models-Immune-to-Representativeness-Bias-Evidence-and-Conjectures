To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Bayes' Theorem**: This states that
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   where \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \), \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \), \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \), and \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

2. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \): These are the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field. These could be informed by general statistics about graduate enrollments in the U.S., but since these aren't provided, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity: \( P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \): These reflect how likely Adam's personality traits are if he were in each field. 

   - For **computer science**:
     - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are strong indicators.
     - Enjoyment of solving puzzles aligns well.
     - However, genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals are less aligned.

   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
     - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are strong indicators.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant.
     - High intelligence and empathy are also favorable traits.

4. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): This is a normalizing constant, which ensures probabilities sum to 1 but is not strictly necessary for comparing \( P(H|E) \) for each field under equal priors.

Let's assign some illustrative values (these would ideally be derived from empirical data, but we'll estimate based on descriptions):

1. \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3 \)
2. \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \)

So, we have:
1. \( P(H = \text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \)
2. \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(H) \) is 0.5 for both and \( P(E) \) is the same for both, the ratio simplifies:

\[
P(H = \text{computer science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.3
\]
\[
P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7
\]

So, in conclusion, normalized probabilities would be:

\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.7} = 0.3
\]
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.7}{0.3 + 0.7} = 0.7
\]

Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are estimative and for illustrative purposes only. Detailed data on enrollment probabilities and conditional likelihoods based on personality traits would refine these estimates.
