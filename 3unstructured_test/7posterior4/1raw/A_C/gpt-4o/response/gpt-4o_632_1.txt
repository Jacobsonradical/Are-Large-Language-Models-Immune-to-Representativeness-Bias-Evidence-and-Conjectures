To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), and the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we can only give qualitative suggestions instead of precise probabilities. Let’s denote:

- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Key Considerations:
- Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts might suggest a fit with a field like computer science, but these traits are not exclusive to this field.

### Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_1) \) (likelihood that we would observe Adam’s personality if he were in computer science) might be moderate, considering that while intelligence and abstract thinking fit, his empathy and love for nature and animals do not directly align with typical computer science traits.
- \( P(E|H_2) \) (likelihood that we would observe Adam’s personality if he were in agricultural and veterinary science) is higher, as empathy, love for nature and animals, curiosity about plants, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.

### Priors:
- Without specific prior probabilities, we will assume a non-informative prior, suggesting there is no bias towards either field.

### Marginal Likelihood:
- \( P(E) \) normalizes the posterior probabilities, but since exact calculation is not possible, we focus on the qualitative assessment.

Based on the overlap between Adam’s interests/traits and the respective fields, we can make qualitative assessments of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values suggest that while there is a chance Adam could be in computer science due to his intelligence and aptitude for abstract thinking, his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy point more strongly towards agricultural and veterinary science.
