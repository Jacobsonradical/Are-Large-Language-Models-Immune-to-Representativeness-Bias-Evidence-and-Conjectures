To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of what each term represents:
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field before considering his personality sketch).
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

While precise numerical values for these probabilities would typically be estimated based on data, we'll reason qualitatively to assign approximate posterior probabilities between 0 and 1 for each field.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam:
- Strong curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, loves animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

First, let's reason about \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science.
   - Enjoying puzzles can be associated with problem-solving in computer science.
   - However, the deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants do not strongly align with typical characteristics of computer science students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants strongly align with this field.
   - Warm-hearted and empathetic nature aligns with caring for animals.
   - High intelligence, appreciation for hard work, and solving puzzles also align with the scientific and practical challenges in this field.

Next, we consider \( P(H) \) which represents the general prior probability of students enrolling in each field. Let's assume these are reasonably common fields for graduate students but do not favor one significantly over the other. 

Finally, \( P(E) \) is a constant that normalizes the probabilities and can be ignored for relative comparison purposes.

Given the above reasoning, we can infer:
- \( P(E|H) \) is higher for "agricultural and veterinary science" compared to "computer science".
- The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are assumed roughly equal.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) should reflect a higher likelihood for "agricultural and veterinary science". We might assign estimated values based on this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that while Adam's characteristics could fit a computer science profile (primarily due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills), they are a much better fit for agricultural and veterinary science given his love for animals and nature.
