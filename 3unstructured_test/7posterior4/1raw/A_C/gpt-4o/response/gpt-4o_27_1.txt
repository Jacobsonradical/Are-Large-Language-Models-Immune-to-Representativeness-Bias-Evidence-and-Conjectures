To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in either agricultural and veterinary science or computer science given his personality sketch \( E \), we would generally use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to the lack of specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for these fields, we'll use qualitative reasoning based on the given information to estimate these probabilities.

Personality Traits from Sketch (E):
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Analysis:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is highly relevant.
  - Deep love for animals aligns closely.
  - Warm heart and empathy are significant for veterinary fields.
  - High appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well.

- **Computer Science:**
  - Enjoys solving puzzles is relevant to problem-solving in computer science.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align well.
  - Not much direct correlation with nature, plants, or animals unless specified in a particular context (e.g., bioinformatics).

Using qualitative reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The strong alignment with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggests a higher posterior probability.
2. **Computer Science:** The alignment with problem-solving and abstract thinking is notable but less strong compared to the direct correlation with nature and animals.

Thus, qualitatively estimating:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the given personality traits and their relevance to each field. Accurate calculation would require actual prior and likelihood values.
