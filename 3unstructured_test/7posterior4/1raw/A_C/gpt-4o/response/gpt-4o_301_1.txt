To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a field given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) across all fields.

Given that we don't have exact prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or exact evidence probabilities (\( P(E) \)) for these fields, we will need to make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch.

Let's assume:
- Adam has characteristics that align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam has characteristics that are somewhat less aligned but still plausible for computer science.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Higher than average due to Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Lower than average but still significant due to his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts.

Based on these qualitative assessments:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \), the likelihood of Adam having these characteristics given he's in agricultural and veterinary science, is high.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \), the likelihood of Adam having these characteristics given he's in computer science, is moderate.

Without exact values, a rough estimation could be:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = 0.4 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities estimated can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Again, these are qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch provided and typical associations with each field. Quantitative analysis would require specific prior and likelihood values.
