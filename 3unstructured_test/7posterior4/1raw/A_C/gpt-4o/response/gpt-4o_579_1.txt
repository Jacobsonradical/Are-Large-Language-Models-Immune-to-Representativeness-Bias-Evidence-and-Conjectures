To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, without specific numerical data for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior, \( P(H) \)**: The probability that any given graduate student is in computer science.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a computer science student would exhibit the characteristics in the personality sketch.

Computer science students often possess qualities such as high intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts. However, traits like a strong empathy for animals and curiosity about nature are not typically associated with computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior, \( P(H) \)**: The probability that any given graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that a student in agricultural and veterinary science would exhibit the characteristics in the personality sketch.

This field aligns well with the traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can make an informed estimation of how likely it is that Adam is enrolled in each field, though it's important to understand these are rough estimations due to the lack of specific data.

Given the qualitative nature of our analysis:

\[
P(\text{computer science}|\text{E}) \approx 0.2 
\]

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\text{E}) \approx 0.7 
\]

Here is the answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```
