To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given field \( H \).
2. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in field \( H \) before considering the personality sketch.
3. **\( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field.

While exact numerical values for these probabilities are not given and would require external data to determine accurately, we can make educated guesses to estimate these probabilities based on the description provided. 

### Estimation based on Personality Sketch:

- **Computer Science**: 
  - \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood that a computer science student would fit Adam's personality sketch. While computer science does involve puzzles and abstract thinking, it doesn't directly relate to nature, plants, or animals.
  - \( P(H) \): Distribution of graduate students across fields often shows higher enrollment in computer science but still varies widely.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): High likelihood, as this field closely aligns with a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
  - \( P(H) \): Fewer students may be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to computer science, adjusting the prior slightly lower.

### Rough Estimations:

We assume:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (as personality fit is not high)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \) (based on common enrollment rates)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.9 \) (high personality fit)
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \) (comparatively fewer enrollments)
- \( P(E) \): This is common across fields but can be normalized.

Now applying Bayesâ€™ theorem:

### For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.09}{P(E)} \]

### Normalization Step:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + \text{Other Fields} \]

Given our rough estimation and emphasis on these two fields primarily:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.09 = 0.12 \]

Dividing by this common term:

### Final Probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.12} \approx 0.25 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.12} \approx 0.75 \]

Thus, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

These values are approximate and rely on the assumptions and likely distributions based on the description provided.
