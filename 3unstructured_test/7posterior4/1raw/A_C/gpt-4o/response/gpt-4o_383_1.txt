To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where: 
1. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
4. \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

To simplify the problem for estimation purposes, we will need subjective priors and likelihoods based on the given personality sketch and the context of graduate fields. Since exact numerical values for these priors and likelihoods are not provided, this will be an estimation based on reasonable assumptions.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- Adam loves animals and has a warm heart with strong empathy.
- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Adam appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We'll assign subjective priors and likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_1) \) = Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(H_2) \) = Prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were enrolled in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): Likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, it’s more fitting for someone in the agricultural and veterinary sciences. However, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts can also suggest potential fit for computer science.

Given these considerations, let's assume:
- \( P(H_1) \) ≈ 0.3
- \( P(H_2) \) ≈ 0.7

For the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_1) \) might be lower, as the sketch implicitly fits better with agricultural and veterinary science.
  So, let's assume \( P(E|H_1) \) ≈ 0.4.
- \( P(E|H_2) \) is higher because the interest in plants and animals aligns well.
  So, \( P(E|H_2) \) ≈ 0.9.

Lastly, \( P(E) \) is the overall evidence probability, but for our purposes, it normalizes results and can be factored out for comparative reasons.

Thus, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.9 \cdot 0.7 = 0.63 \]

We normalize these to get approximate posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.63} ≈ 0.16
\]

\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.63}{0.12 + 0.63} ≈ 0.84
\]

Thus, the answer in the required format is:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84
}
