To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know several components:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis (field of study).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), the overall probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields.

However, since specific prior probabilities and likelihoods are not given for these fields, we must make some reasoned assumptions based on typical characteristics of students in these fields and the information provided in the personality sketch.

**Assumptions and Reasoned Estimations:**

1. **Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \)):**
   - Let's assume that the prior probabilities for each field are somewhat even, but not given specific values.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Students typically have a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and may also value hard work and dedication, making this field a good fit for Adam's personality sketch.
   - For computer science: Students often have high intelligence, enjoy solving puzzles, and understand abstract concepts. Adam fits some of these aspects but may not be as closely aligned with the nature or animals aspect.

3. **Posterior \( P(H|E) \):**
   - Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - Without concrete prior probabilities and a full value for \( P(E) \), we'll focus on the proportionality given the likelihoods and reasonable assumptions.

### Calculations:

Given that Adam's traits highly align with agricultural and veterinary science (nature, plants, animals, hard work) and moderately align with computer science (intelligence, puzzles, abstract concepts), we can assign subjective proportional likelihoods based on the alignments.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \)**
   - High alignment -> subjective \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Computer Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \)**
   - Moderate alignment -> subjective \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.5 \)

Given that the priors \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) \) are considered equal, the proportional posteriors mainly reflect these likelihoods.

### Values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

These values are not absolute but proportional based on alignments with Adam's personality, assuming equal priors. Alternatively, more accurate numerical values would need specific prior distributions and exact field data.
