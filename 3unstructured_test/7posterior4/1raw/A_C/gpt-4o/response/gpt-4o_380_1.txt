To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)). In absence of specific values, I'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), let's use reasonable assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assuming equal priors for both fields since there's no information favoring one over the other.

\[ P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on the personality of Adam:
   - Computer Science: Adam's high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts fit well, but his warm heart and empathy are not specific to this field.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.

To simplify and in absence of specific data, we'll assume the likelihood as follows:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.3 \]  (Less alignment with some traits)
\[ P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \]  (Strong alignment with most traits)

We don't have the exact marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), but since it's constant for different fields, we can focus on the numerators for comparison.

Using the assumptions:

For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Normalizing these values (so their sum equals 1):

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.5} = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.35}{0.15 + 0.35} = \frac{0.35}{0.5} = 0.7 \]

So the posterior probabilities will be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These values are based on the assumptions and reasonable likelihood estimates. Actual computations could vary with different prior and likelihood values.
