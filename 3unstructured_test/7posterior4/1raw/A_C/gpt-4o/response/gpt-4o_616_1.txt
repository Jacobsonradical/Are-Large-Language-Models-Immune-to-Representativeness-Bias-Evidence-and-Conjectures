To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field (before considering the personality sketch).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field \( H \).
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without actual numerical values for priors and specific conditional probabilities, we can only qualitatively discuss the relative likelihoods.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- Adam has a strong empathy, love for animals, and a deep appreciation for nature and its plants, which strongly aligns with traits beneficial for a career in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Although Adam is intelligent and good at solving puzzles, which are useful traits in computer science, his pronounced empathy and love for animals suggest a closer fit with agricultural and veterinary science.

Without specific numerical data, we can still make reasonable qualitative estimates based on these descriptions.

Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields are equal, making \( P(H) \) for each field 0.5 initially. Considering the likelihoods qualitatively and assuming they reflect the observations in the sketch:

- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) might be moderate because of his intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities, let's say 0.3.
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) might be high because of his empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for plants, let's say 0.8.

Now, let's compute \( P(E) \) as the sum of these weighted likelihoods:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science})P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science})P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.3 \times 0.5) + (0.8 \times 0.5) = 0.15 + 0.4 = 0.55 \]

Finally, the posterior probabilities:

- For computer science:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.55} = \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.55} = \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.273",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.727"
}
