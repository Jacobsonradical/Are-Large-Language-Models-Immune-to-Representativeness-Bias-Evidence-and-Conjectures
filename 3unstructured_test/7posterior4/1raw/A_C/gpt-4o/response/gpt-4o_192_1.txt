To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can qualitatively interpret the likelihood based on the given personality sketch and the general characteristics of the fields of study. 

Given that Adam is described as someone with a curiosity about nature, plants, animals, high intelligence, and empathy, we can infer that:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science seems highly compatible with Adam's interests and personality traits, especially with his empathy towards animals and interest in nature.
2. Computer Science typically requires strong analytical skills and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses, but it doesn’t align as closely with his direct interests in nature and animals.

Without hard numerical data, our probabilities will be subjective, but based on the description provided, we could reason as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,    // Adam's analytical skills and intelligence make it plausible but not a strong match.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8    // Adam's curiosity, empathy, and love for animals make this a strong match.
}

It’s important to note that these values are interpretative estimates based on the context and should ideally be validated against more detailed information or statistical data for accurate determination.
