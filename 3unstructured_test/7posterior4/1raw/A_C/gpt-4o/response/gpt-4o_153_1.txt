To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall evidence \( P(E) \). Without actual statistical data on the distribution of graduate students in different fields and the characteristic fit of Adam's personality to those fields, we must provide subjective estimates based on the given description.

Bayesâ€™ rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact numbers, we will assume the priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity, and assign likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on the fit between Adam's personality traits and typical requirements of each field. Also, due to lack of the total evidence \( P(E) \), comparisons will be relative to our subjective estimates.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's traits like high intelligence and problem-solving abilities fit well with computer science.
   - However, more specific traits such as a deep love for nature and animals and a dedication to appreciating hard work might make it a less likely fit.
   - Subjectively: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Traits like a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Subjectively: \( P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \approx 0.7 \)

Using equal priors for simplicity:

- \( P(E) \) can be considered as the sum of the estimates with respect to different hypotheses (field of studies).

Hence:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{0.1 \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + 0.7 \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})}{0.1 \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + 0.7 \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})} \]

Given equal priors:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E):P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = 0.1:0.7 \]

Normalizing these for just the two shown fields:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.7} = \frac{1}{8} \approx 0.125 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7}{0.1+0.7} = \frac{7}{8} \approx 0.875 \]

Thus, the estimates are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875
}
```
