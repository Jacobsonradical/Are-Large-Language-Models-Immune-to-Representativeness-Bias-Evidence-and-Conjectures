To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given fields, let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

According to Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood.

Without specific data on prior probabilities and marginal likelihoods, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch to estimate the likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): While Adam’s high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles align with computer science, his profound love for nature, plants, and animals doesn't strongly correlate with this field. Let’s assume a moderate likelihood estimate.
   - Prior \( P(H_1) \): Assume a general prior based on the prevalence of computer science graduate students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy substantially align with agricultural and veterinary science. This increases its likelihood.
   - Prior \( P(H_2) \): Assume a general prior based on the prevalence of agricultural and veterinary science graduate students.

For simplicity, let’s assume equal priors for both fields due to lack of specific information. We use qualitative likelihood estimates to infer posterior probabilities.

Given the qualitative information, the probabilities can be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of the personality sketch with the typical demands and interests of each field. Remember that actual probabilities would require more precise prior data and likelihoods.
