To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis or the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Hypothesis \( H_1 \))**:
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
    - He has a deep love for animals.
    - These traits are heavily aligned with a field that involves studying plants and animals.

2. **Computer Science (Hypothesis \( H_2 \))**:
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
    - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
    - These traits are compatible with the problem-solving and conceptual nature of computer science.
    
Given these considerations, we qualitatively estimate the probabilities. We need to make reasonable assumptions about the priors and how well the personality sketch maps to each field of study. Here is the qualitative assessment for the relative likelihoods:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given the strong alignment of his curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, this field seems quite probable.
- **Computer Science**: While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving abilities fit well, the personality sketch heavily emphasizes nature and animals, which might indicate a slightly lower probability relative to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the qualitative nature of this question and the lack of numerical priors, let's express the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These probabilities reflect an assumption that Adam's interest in nature and animals significantly influences the likelihood of him being in agricultural and veterinary science, compared to computer science.
