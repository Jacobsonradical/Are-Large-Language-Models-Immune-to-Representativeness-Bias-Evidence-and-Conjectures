To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the elements given:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): This is the initial probability we assign to each hypothesis (Adam's field of study) before considering the personality sketch \( E \).
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in the particular field \( H \).
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), regardless of the field of study.
4. **Posterior probability** \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam is in field \( H \) given his personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values, let's consider the qualitative aspects of the given information.

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a common field for graduate students, so we might assign a moderate prior probability.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts (which are strong indicators for computer science), his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and interest in nature are less typical for computer science students.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is a less common field compared to computer science, so we might assign a lower prior probability.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and warm heart are strongly indicative of a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative considerations:

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate (say around 0.4)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Lower because the specific traits apart from intelligence aren't as common in computer science (say 0.25)

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Lower (say around 0.1)
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High because of the strong match in personality traits (say 0.8)

Without exact numbers for evidence \( P(E) \), we can only provide comparative posteriors.

Given these qualitative estimations, the posterior conditional probabilities might look like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are indicative and based on the qualitative aspects discussed. For a precise computation, specific prior probabilities and likelihood values would need to be known.
