To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we need to estimate several components: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, and the normalizing constant. Without specific prior data, we can make educated assumptions based on the match between Adam's characteristics and the typical attributes required for each field. 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, he might be more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Meanwhile, his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles could also fit computer science, though to a lesser degree based on the given characteristics.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.

We can make an approximate qualitative assessment as follows:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_1 \)):
- Prior probability \( P(H_1) \): Reasonably high given Adam's characteristics.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): High, since his traits such as love for animals and curiosity align well with this field.

### For Computer Science (\( H_2 \)):
- Prior probability \( P(H_2) \): Moderate, given the prevalence of this field.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): Moderate, as his intelligence and problem-solving skills align but less so his empathy and love for animals.

Assuming roughly equal prior probabilities for simplicity due to a lack of specific data, the posterior probabilities will largely depend on the qualitative fit of Adam's traits to each field.

Now, using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we're doing a qualitative estimate without specific priors and normalizing constants, we can simplify to relative scales:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are approximations that reflect our qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch relative to the characteristics typical for each field.
