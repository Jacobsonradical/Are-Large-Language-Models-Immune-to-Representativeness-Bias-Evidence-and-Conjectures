To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd normally need data about the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field (prior knowledge about how many students enroll in each field), the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given his field of study, and the overall distribution of these traits across all graduate students. Without these exact values, I'll make reasoned estimates based on the information provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his warm heart and empathy, it seems more likely that Adam would be pursuing a degree related to agricultural and veterinary science. However, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts could also fit a student in computer science. 

Let's assume some intuitive values for the sake of reasoning.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Say there is a 10% prior chance a graduate student is enrolled in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in this field, there is a high chance he would exhibit these traits, let's say 80%.
   - \( P(E) \): Consider overall, given all graduate students in various fields, the probability of exhibiting these traits is 30%.

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Say there is a 20% prior chance a graduate student is enrolled in this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam is in this field, there is a moderate chance he would exhibit these traits, let's say 40%.
   - \( P(E) \): The same 30% probability of exhibiting these traits.

   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

So, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.267",
  "computer science": "0.267"
}
```

These results are rough estimates to illustrate the process. Actual probabilities would depend on specific data about graduate field distributions and personality traits.
