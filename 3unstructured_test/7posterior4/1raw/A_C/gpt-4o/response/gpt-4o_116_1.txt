To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific statistical data for each probability, we can't compute exact values. We can make a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

### Based on E (the personality sketch of Adam):
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, which suggests analytical skills.
- He has a strong empathy and love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He values hard work and dedication.

### Hypotheses:
- H1: Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- H2: Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Qualitative Estimate:
- **Computer Science (H1):**
  - Analytical skills and solving puzzles align well with computer science.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also a good fit.
  - Less alignment with nature, plants, and animals compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Empathy and love for animals are less directly related.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2):**
  - Strong alignment with an interest in nature, plants, and animals.
  - Empathy and love for animals are a good fit.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial.
  - Hard work and dedication are also relevant.
  - Analytical skills and problem-solving can also be useful but may not be the primary focus.

Given these qualitative assessments, we estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect our judgment that Adam's personality traits and interests align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with computer science. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, these values are approximate and based on qualitative reasoning.
