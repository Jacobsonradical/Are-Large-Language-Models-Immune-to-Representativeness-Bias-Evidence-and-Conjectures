In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since the exact prior probabilities are not given, we can make a few reasonable assumptions based on the information provided and then compute the probabilities in a qualitative manner.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch E and the fields:

1. **Computer Science**: Let's assess this. Adam shows high intelligence, a good understanding of abstract concepts, and a fondness for puzzles. These traits are fairly common among computer science students. However, his profound interest in nature, plants, and animals is not strongly aligned with this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits are highly relevant to the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, let's assign some qualitative likelihoods based on how well the personality traits match the fields:

**Computer Science:**
- High intelligence: 0.7
- Abstract concepts: 0.7
- Puzzles: 0.7
- Nature/plants, animals: 0.2

Combined qualitative likelihood for computer science \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.2 \approx 0.0686 \).

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- High intelligence: 0.7
- Empathy and warm heart: 0.8
- Love for animals: 0.9
- Curiosity about nature/plants: 0.9

Combined qualitative likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H_{avs}) \approx 0.7 \times 0.8 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \approx 0.4536 \).

Assuming uniform priors \( P(H_{cs}) = P(H_{avs}) = 0.5 \) as we don't have any specific priors, we can qualitatively assess the posterior probabilities. \( P(E) \) will normalize these but we don't need the exact values for comparing relative likelihoods.

So, qualitatively:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.0686 \approx 0.0343 \]
\[ P(H_{avs}|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.4536 \approx 0.2268 \]

Considering proportions:

- Computer Science is \(\frac{0.0343}{0.0343 + 0.2268} \approx 0.131\)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is \(\frac{0.2268}{0.0343 + 0.2268} \approx 0.869\)

So, the approximated posterior probabilities would be:

  "computer science": 0.13,
