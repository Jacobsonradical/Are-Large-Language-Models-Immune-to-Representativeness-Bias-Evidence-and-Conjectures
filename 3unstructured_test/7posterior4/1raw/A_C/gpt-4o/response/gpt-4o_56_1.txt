To determine the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we can utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have the exact values for these probabilities, we need to make educated estimations based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This would depend on the overall proportion of students choosing agricultural and veterinary sciences as a field of study.
     - Let's assume it is 0.05 (5% of students choose this field).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science would have a personality sketch like Adam's.
     - Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and warm heart, this could be quite high. Let's assume it is 0.8.
   - **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: This would be the total probability of observing this personality sketch across all fields. Given that Adam's qualities are not extremely unique but still somewhat aligned with specific fields, let's make a rough estimate.
     - Assume \(P(E) = 0.2\).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: This would depend on the proportion of students choosing computer science as a field of study.
     - Let's assume it is 0.2 (20% of students choose this field).
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Likelihood that a student in computer science would have a personality sketch like Adam's.
     - Given his high intelligence and intrigue with solving puzzles, this could be moderately high. However, the interest in nature and animals is less typical. Let's assume 0.3.
   - **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: Assuming this remains the same across assumptions.
     - \(P(E) = 0.2\).

Let's calculate these values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(\text{H|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2}
\]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[
P(\text{H|\text{Computer Science}}) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.2} = 0.3
\]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
