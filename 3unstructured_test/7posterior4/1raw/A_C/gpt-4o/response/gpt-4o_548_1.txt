To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where,
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given that we don't have direct data to calculate exact values for likelihoods and priors, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the typical profiles of students in the specified fields.

1. **Computer Science**: Students in computer science tend to have high intelligence and are good at solving puzzles, which fits Adam's profile well. However, they may not typically have a strong empathy for nature and animals unless they are involved in specific subfields like bioinformatics.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Students in agricultural and veterinary science often have a deep love for animals and nature, as well as an appreciation for hard work and dedication. This aligns very closely with Adam's personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and marginal likelihoods \(P(E)\) are equal across different fields. In that case, the posterior probabilities essentially depend on how well the personality sketch \(E\) fits with each hypothesis \(H\).

Based on the above qualitative assessment, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on the fit of Adam's personality traits to the typical profiles of students in these fields. Adjustments can be made with more specific data on priors and likelihoods.
