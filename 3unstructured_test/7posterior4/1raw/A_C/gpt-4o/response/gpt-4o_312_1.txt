To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, one must consider the prior probabilities P(H) of Adam being in each field and the likelihood P(E|H) of observing Adam's personality sketch given each field. Without specific data on these probabilities, it's necessary to estimate based on the provided information.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- E = Adam's personality sketch
- H1 = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science
- H2 = Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

Let's make some reasonable assumptions:

### Prior Probabilities (P(H)):
Assume the prior probabilities for general graduate enrollment fields are:
- P(H1) for computer science is 0.2 since it is a very popular field.
- P(H2) for agricultural and veterinary science is 0.05 as itâ€™s less common.

### Likelihoods (P(E|H)):
Given Adam's personality traits, we can assign likelihoods based on how well these traits align with each field:
- For computer science (H1), Adam's intelligence and appreciation for solving puzzles are highly relevant, while his love for nature and animals is less so. So, let P(E|H1) = 0.3.
- For agricultural and veterinary science (H2), Adam's love for nature and animals and empathy are highly relevant. So, let P(E|H2) = 0.8.

Since the exact value of P(E) is unknown, we will use a relative comparison instead of an absolute value.

Calculating posterior probabilities:
For computer science:
\[ P(E|H1) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(H1) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.06}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(E|H2) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H2) = 0.05 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.04}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing relative probabilities:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = 0.06 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = 0.04 \]

Approximate normalized probabilities:
- The sum of both probabilities is 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.10
- Normalize these values to sum to 1.

For computer science:
\[ P(H|E)_{cs} = \frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} = \frac{0.04}{0.10} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

However, note that these values are based on assumptions and estimations. Actual data could yield different results.
