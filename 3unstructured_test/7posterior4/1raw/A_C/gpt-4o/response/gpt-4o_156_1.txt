To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not only the personality sketch of Adam (E) but also the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given that he is in each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science), we will need to make some assumptions about:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of students being enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the given personality sketch if Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing the personality sketch, which can be complex to compute exactly, but we can consider it as a normalizing constant.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some qualitative judgments about \( P(E|H) \). Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoyment in solving puzzles align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science. Conversely, his high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might apply to both fields but are particularly emphasized in computer science.

Let's make some reasoned estimations for these probabilities in the context of the given sketch:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Letâ€™s assume the prior probability of Adam being in computer science is moderate, say around 0.20 (20%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Given the personality sketch, the likelihood of such traits in a computer science student might be lower, perhaps around 0.10.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Assuming Adam fits this field better given his love for animals and nature, this might be higher, say around 0.15 (15%).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch fitting this field seems quite high, say around 0.70.

We can only provide relative values for posterior probabilities; however, without the exact marginal probability \( P(E) \), we'll use inferred relative likelihoods.

{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.20}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \approx 0.105 \)
}

Normalizing to see relative probabilities, assuming \( P(E) \approx 1 \) for simplicity:

{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.105
}

To provide probabilities that add up in the context of our options and represent meaningful skill balance:

- Normalize them relatively:
  \[ Total = 0.02 + 0.105 = 0.125 \]
  \[ \frac{0.02}{0.125} \approx 0.16 \]
  \[ \frac{0.105}{0.125} \approx 0.84 \]

So,

{
  "computer science": 0.16,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84
}
