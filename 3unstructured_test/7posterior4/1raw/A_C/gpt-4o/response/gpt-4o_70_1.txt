To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we typically focus on the values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis to compare them, as the actual computation of \( P(E) \) would require summing over all possible fields which is not provided.

1. \( H \): Agricultural and veterinary science
2. \( H \): Computer science

Given the personality sketch \( E \):

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(E| H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \): High, as Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy fits well with this field.
- \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \): Moderate, as it is a less common field compared to some other fields but still significant.

**Computer Science:**
- \( P(E| H_{\text{comp\_sci}}) \): Moderate to High, Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with the analytical nature of computer science, but the emphasis on nature and animals is less relevant.
- \( P(H_{\text{comp\_sci}}) \): High, as computer science is a very common field among graduate students.

Now, let's assign rough probabilities:

\[ P(E| H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}}) \approx 0.15 \]
\[ P(E| H_{\text{comp\_sci}}) \approx 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{comp\_sci}}) \approx 0.25 \]

Then:

\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}} | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{comp\_sci}} | E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.25}{P(E)} = \frac{0.125}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, the ratio of \( P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}} | E) \) to \( P(H_{\text{comp\_sci}} | E) \) reflects the relative likelihoods.

Therefore, normalizing these values to sum to 1:

\[ k = \frac{1}{0.12 + 0.125} = \frac{1}{0.245} \approx 4.08 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agri\_vet}} | E) \approx 0.12 \times 4.08 = 0.49 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{comp\_sci}} | E) \approx 0.125 \times 4.08 = 0.51 \]

However, to follow your requirement strictly where the total does not need to be 1, we present the raw unnormalized values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.12",
  "computer science": "0.125"
}
