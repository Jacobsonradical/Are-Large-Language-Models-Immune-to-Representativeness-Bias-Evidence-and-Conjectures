To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field without considering any personality sketch information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we may not have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we'll need to make some educated assumptions based on the information in the personality sketch and the nature of the fields. We'll also note that since we are only comparing two fields, common factors will cancel out, allowing us to focus on the relative likelihoods.

### Assumptions

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   Based on the common distribution of graduate students across fields, we might suppose some estimated priors. Let's assume:
   - \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.1 \) (10% for agricultural and veterinary science)
   - \( P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.2 \) (20% for computer science)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's personality attributes:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, traits like curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and a love for animals make it quite likely.
   - For computer science, his high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and love for solving puzzles are relevant, though empathy and animals are less so.

   Let's estimate:
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.7 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.5 \)

### Calculation

1. **Posterior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator for both fields and we are only comparing relative likelihoods, it effectively cancels out:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07
   \]

2. **Posterior for Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1
   \]

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities

Since we need values between 0 and 1, we'll normalize these values:

\[
P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.1} = 0.41
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.07 + 0.1} = 0.59
\]
