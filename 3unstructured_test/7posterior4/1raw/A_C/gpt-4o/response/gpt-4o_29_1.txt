To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before observing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence, which can be considered the sum of the likelihoods for all relevant hypotheses.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods directly provided, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge and general trends observed in the graduate student population.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume that the likelihood of someone being enrolled in computer science is somewhat high, given that it's a popular field.
   - The likelihood of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is lower due to it being a more specialized field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For computer science, curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals do not particularly make this more likely.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, interest in nature, plants, and animals directly aligns with the field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - This factors in the overall likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible graduate studies.

### Estimations:
Given these assumptions:

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \) might be around \( 0.3 \) (since many students choose computer science).
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be around \( 0.2 \) (since Adam's personality sketch is less aligned with typical computer science traits).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \) might be around \( 0.1 \) (fewer students are in these specialized fields).
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be around \( 0.8 \) (since Adam's traits closely match this field).

Let's estimate \( P(E) \) to normalize:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.3 \times 0.2 + 0.1 \times 0.8 + \text{other factors} \approx 0.06 + 0.08 + \text{others} \approx 0.14 \text{ (This value is somewhat contrived for simplicity)} \]

### Calculations:
- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{0.14} \approx 0.43
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(\text{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AgVet}) \cdot P(\text{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.14} \approx 0.57
  \]
