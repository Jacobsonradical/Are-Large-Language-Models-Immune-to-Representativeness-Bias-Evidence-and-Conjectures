To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we lack specific prior probabilities and detailed likelihoods, we can qualitatively infer the likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch. Let's denote:

- \( H_{cs} \) : Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_{avs} \) : Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, we can hypothesize the likelihoods. 

For computer science:
- The personality traits of understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence align with computer science.
- However, the explicit curiosity about nature and love for animals are less directly related to computer science.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- The traits of genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work directly align with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative assessment, we might assign higher likelihood \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) to agricultural and veterinary science than \( P(E|H_{cs}) \).

Given this setup, let's provide the estimated posterior probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate that Adam's personality sketch aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than computer science, although there is still some probability he could be enrolled in computer science given his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
