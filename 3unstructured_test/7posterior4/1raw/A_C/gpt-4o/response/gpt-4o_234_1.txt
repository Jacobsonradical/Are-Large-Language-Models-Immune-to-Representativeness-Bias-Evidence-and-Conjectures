To estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need four pieces of information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence.
4. \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) / P(E) \): The posterior probability.

In this particular case, we can make qualitative estimates based on the characteristics provided in the personality sketch \( E \) and some general knowledge. Below are qualitative assessments of the factors based on the described personality:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - **P(E|H)**: If \( H \) is "Adam is a Computer Science student," then what is the likelihood of observing \( E \)? Attributes like high intelligence, an interest in solving puzzles, and the ability to understand abstract concepts would generally be consistent with a Computer Science student. However, the deep love for animals and strong connection to nature are not strong indicators for this field.
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability of a given graduate student being in Computer Science is fairly high, given it's a popular field with broad applications.
    - **Overall**: While some characteristics align, the strong affinity for nature and animals may not fully match.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **P(E|H)**: If \( H \) is "Adam is an Agricultural and Veterinary Science student," the likelihood of observing \( E \) is quite high. The love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy align perfectly with this field.
    - **P(H)**: The prior probability of being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is lower overall compared to a field like Computer Science, but the evidence \( E \) strongly suggests this specific interest.
    - **Overall**: This field aligns very closely with the described traits.

Given these assessments, we can make qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

The higher probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science reflects the stronger alignment with Adam's interests in nature, empathy, and animals. Computer Science has some alignment but is less consistent with the full personality sketch.
