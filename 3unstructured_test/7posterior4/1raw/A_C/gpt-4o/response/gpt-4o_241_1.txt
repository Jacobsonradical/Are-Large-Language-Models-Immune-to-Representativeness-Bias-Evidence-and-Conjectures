To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis (i.e., the fields of study), we can only provide a qualitative approximation based on the information given in the personality sketch (E).

Given that Adam has a passion for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, he seems more oriented towards fields closely related to the natural environment. While he has high intelligence and curiosity, which might fit the field of computer science, the sketch more strongly points towards agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Therefore, we assign higher likelihoods to the fields based on the alignment of personality traits. Here is an approximation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This approximation suggests that while there is a possibility Adam was in computer science, his traits make him more likely to have been involved in agricultural and veterinary science.
