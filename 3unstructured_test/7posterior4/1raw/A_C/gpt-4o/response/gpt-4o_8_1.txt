Certainly! To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field, \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in that field, \( P(E|H) \). 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are not provided with exact numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in each field.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his warm heart, it is highly likely that he fits well in this field.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): High
   - \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Assume a typical moderate prior probability, since it's a specialized field, let's assume 0.1.

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Given Adam's intelligence and affinity for solving puzzles, he could also fit well in computer science.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to High, but lesser than AVS due to less relevance to his empathy for animals and nature.
   - \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): Based on general popularity, let's assume a higher prior, say 0.2.

Given these qualitative assessments, we might estimate the conditional probabilities. However, without concrete numerical data, the exact values will inherently be subjective. Here is a possible estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,  // High likelihood tied to his interests and attributes
  "computer science": 0.4  // Moderate likelihood due to his abstract thinking and problem-solving skills
}

These estimations reflect our qualitative reasoning. To provide more precise probabilities, actual data on enrollment rates and detailed likelihood measurements would be needed.
