To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the terms needed for Bayes' rule**:
   Bayes' rule states:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having that personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
   - \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of Adam having that personality sketch (a normalizing constant).

2. **Assumptions for \( P(H) \)**:
   Since specific data on the overall distribution of graduate students in these fields are not provided, we'll make a reasonable assumption based on general knowledge. Suppose there is a distribution of graduate fields among students in the U.S.:
   - Probability \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \) (assuming 5% of graduate students are in this field)
   - Probability \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 \) (assuming 15% of graduate students are in this field, considering the popularity of this field)

3. **Estimating \( P(E|H) \) for each field**:
   - \( H : \text{agricultural and veterinary science} \), given Adam's love for nature and animals, along with empathy and appreciation for hard work:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.9 \)

   - \( H : \text{computer science} \), given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and affinity for solving puzzles:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.6 \)

4. **Estimating \( P(E) \)**:
   Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and acts as a normalizing constant, we can neglect it in a relative comparison for each field.

5. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \)**:
   Using the assumed values:
   \[
   P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   For agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045
   \]

   For computer science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.15 = 0.09
   \]
   
   Normalize these values by dividing by their sum to get relative probabilities (although this exact normalization isn't necessary for this simple comparison):

   Normalizing factor:
   \[
   0.045 + 0.09 = 0.135
   \]

   Normalized probabilities:

   Agricultutal and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.135} \approx 0.333
   \]

   Computer science:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.135} \approx 0.667
   \]

However, in the specified format, it is satisfactory to give the initial unnormalized probabilities.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "computer science": 0.09
}
```

This reflects the relative likelihoods without needing to fully normalize them, knowing these don't sum to 1 because there are other fields not considered here.
