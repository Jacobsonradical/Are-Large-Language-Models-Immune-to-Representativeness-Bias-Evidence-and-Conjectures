To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we'll have to make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided. We need to consider how likely Adam's personality traits would be given that he is enrolled in either computer science or agricultural and veterinary science. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This could be moderate to high because computer science is a common field for high-intelligence individuals with an ability to understand abstract concepts.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are less typical but not impossible in computer science. Solving puzzles and abstract thinking align well with computer science.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This could be lower in general compared to computer science since fewer students enroll in these fields, but it could be higher if Adam's undergraduate background or interests lean towards biology, agriculture, or veterinary areas.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: His love for nature, animals, and plants aligns very well with this field. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also good matches.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide rough estimates for the posterior probabilities. 

Let's assume:
- Prior Probability for Computer Science: \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.4 \)
- Prior Probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(\text{AV}) = 0.2 \)
- Normalizing the likelihoods based on the traits, let's assume \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E|\text{AV}) = 0.7 \).

Given these assumptions, we can normalize to get:

\[ P(H | E)_\text{CS}  = \frac{P(E | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(E | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(E | \text{AV}) P(\text{AV})} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.4}{0.3 \times 0.4 + 0.7 \times 0.2} \]

\[ P(H | E)_\text{CS} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.14} = \frac{0.12}{0.26} = \approx 0.462 \]

\[ P(H | E)_\text{AV} = \frac{P(E | \text{AV}) P(\text{AV})}{P(E | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(E | \text{AV}) P(\text{AV})} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.2}{0.3 \times 0.4 + 0.7 \times 0.2} \]

\[ P(H | E)_\text{AV} = \frac{0.14}{0.12 + 0.14} = \frac{0.14}{0.26} = \approx 0.538 \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.462,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.538
}
```
