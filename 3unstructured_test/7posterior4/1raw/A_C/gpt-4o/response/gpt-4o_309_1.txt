To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we would typically use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

In practice, without concrete values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will rely on intuitive assessments.

Given \( E \) (the personality sketch) and the fields in question, here are qualitative assessments:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity and intelligence lend themselves well to computer science.
   - Puzzle-solving and abstract concepts are highly relevant to computer science.
   - However, the deep love for animals and nature might not be intensely prominent in computer science.
   - Likely prior for computer science graduate students specializing in nature-related or interdisciplinary fields might be lower.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Strong fit with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart (empathy).
   - A quiet personality and appreciation for dedication align well with research and fieldwork in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - Puzzles and abstract concepts could be involved in complex problem-solving in these fields.

Given these intuition-based assessments, let's assign plausible probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect an informed yet speculative assessment based on the evidence presented about Adam's personality and interests.
