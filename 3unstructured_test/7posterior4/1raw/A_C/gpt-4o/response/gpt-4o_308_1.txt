To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, the prior probability of each hypothesis, and the probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the exact numerical values for the priors, likelihoods, or the evidence probabilities. Therefore, I'll make reasonable qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields.

### Analysis for Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Nature and Plants:** High relevance, aligns with genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- **Love for Animals:** High relevance (veterinary science).
- **Warm Heart and Empathy:** Relevant, needed in dealing with animals.
- **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts:** Relevant, but more in a practical context.

### Analysis for Computer Science

- **Solving Puzzles:** Highly relevant (common in programming, algorithms).
- **High Intelligence & Abstract Concepts:** Highly relevant.
- **Warm Heart and Empathy:** Less directly relevant, though valuable in teams.
- **Nature and Animals:** Less directly relevant.

Considering these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the evidence \( E \) is more strongly indicative of Adam pursuing a field where working with nature, plants, and animals is paramount.

Given these qualitative insights, one could assign heuristic probabilities to represent these qualitative assessments. Let's consider the following:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

Given the importance of empathy, nature, and animal love tilting the balance more towards agricultural and veterinary sciences, the probabilities are reflective of the qualitative biases inferred from the personality sketch.
