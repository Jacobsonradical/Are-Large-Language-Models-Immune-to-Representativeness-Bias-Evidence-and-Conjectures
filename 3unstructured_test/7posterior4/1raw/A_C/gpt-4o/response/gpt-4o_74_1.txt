To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "computer science" and "agricultural and veterinary science," we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the exact values for these probabilities, so we will make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - Assume equal prior probabilities for both fields since we have no initial reason to favor one over the other.
   - Therefore, \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \).
  
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Given Adam's characteristics, such as solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are typical for computer science students, we might estimate this to be around 0.5.
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Given his love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, this field seems more aligned with his personality sketch. We might estimate this to be higher, around 0.7.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - Considering both fields and Adam's characteristics, let's assume \( P(E) \) balances out to a moderate value. Since this affects both fields equally, we can think of it as a normalizing constant and simplify our calculations by focusing on the \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) terms.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Using the above assumptions and Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.25}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.35}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we will present the ratios of the posteriors:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```

These are indicative values showing that the subject's personality sketch makes it more likely for Adam to be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science.
