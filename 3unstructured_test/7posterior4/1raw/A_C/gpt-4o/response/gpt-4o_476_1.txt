To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, \( P(H) \), the likelihood of the personality sketch given the hypothesis (field of study), \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' Rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we can qualitatively estimate them based on the descriptive information provided.

Let's denote:
- H1: Adam is enrolled in computer science
- H2: Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science
- E: Personality sketch of Adam

Given Adam's traits (interest in nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy), it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of these traits given H2 (agricultural and veterinary science) is higher than given H1 (computer science).

### Estimations:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** 
    - It's difficult to estimate accurately without specific data, so we will consider both fields to have equal priors initially. Let's denote this as \( P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** 
    - Traits aligning more with the agricultural and veterinary sciences make \( P(E|H2) \) higher compared to \( P(E|H1) \).

### Qualitative Estimation:
- **Computer Science \( P(H1|E) \):** Adam's personality traits such as high intelligence and abstract thinking align with computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals makes it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we estimate a lower probability here.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(H2|E) \):** Adam's traits strongly align with the requirements and interests of this field. Therefore, we estimate a higher probability here.

### Calculation (Unnormalized for simplicity):
Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H1) \), the likelihood of traits fitting computer science: Low (roughly 0.2 for illustrative purposes)
- \( P(E|H2) \), the likelihood of traits fitting agricultural and veterinary science: High (roughly 0.8 for illustrative purposes)

Using these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These values represent an illustrative and qualitative approximation, with the understanding that a deeper statistical analysis with precise prior and likelihood values would be required for accurate quantification.
