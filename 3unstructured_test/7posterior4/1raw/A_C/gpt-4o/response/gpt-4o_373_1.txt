To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow the outline of Bayes' theorem and use some logical inferences based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the general attributes associated with each field.

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Without specific numerical values given for \( P(H) \) or \( P(E) \), and using logical reasoning and the personality sketch provided, we’ll need to make qualitative assessments.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature and his deep love for animals, it is quite high that he fits the personality sketch if enrolled in this field.
   - **P(H)**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science are less common than those in computer science but still significant.
   - **P(E)**: The total probability of someone in agricultural and veterinary science fitting Adam's sketch is reasonable.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, this likelihood is moderate.
   - **P(H)**: The number of graduate students in computer science is relatively high compared to many other fields, suggesting a higher prior probability.
   - **P(E)**: The total probability of someone in computer science fitting Adam's sketch is plausible but may not align as perfectly as agricultural and veterinary science with the detailed personality traits related to nature and animals.

Given these logical assessments, we can hypothesize reasonable qualitative values.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

The values indicate a higher probability that Adam’s personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science compared to computer science, based on the given traits and interests.
