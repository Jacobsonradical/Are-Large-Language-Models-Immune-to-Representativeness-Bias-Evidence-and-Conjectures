To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \): This is the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the personality traits described in E given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of Adam having the personality traits described regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we lack specific data to calculate the exact probabilities, we can make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume an arbitrary prior like 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: High likelihood.
   - Love for animals: High likelihood.
   - Empathy and warm heart: Moderate to high likelihood.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: Moderate likelihood.
   - Appreciation for hard work: High likelihood.

   Given these factors, let's assume a likelihood of around 0.8.

### Computer Science

1. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Assume an arbitrary prior like 0.2.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Low to moderate likelihood.
   - Love for animals: Low likelihood.
   - Empathy and warm heart: Low to moderate likelihood.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts: High likelihood.
   - Appreciation for hard work: High likelihood.

   Given these factors, let's assume a likelihood of around 0.4.

### Normalization (Evidence P(E))

Since we don't have exact priors or detailed data, we wonâ€™t calculate the exact value for evidence. Instead, we focus on the relative likelihoods we estimated.

Putting this all together:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16
  \]

- For computer science:
  \[
  P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08
  \]

### Approximate Posterior Probabilities
Without normalization (due to lack of exact evidence \( P(E) \)), our relative comparisons would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.08
}
```

Please note, these values are heuristic and depend on the assumptions made for priors and likelihoods. For precise calculations, specific data on the distribution of students across fields and trait likelihoods would be required.
