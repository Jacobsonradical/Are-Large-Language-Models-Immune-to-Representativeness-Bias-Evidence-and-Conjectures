To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch \( E \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \).
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the personality sketch, considering all possible fields. It can be calculated as the sum of \( P(E|H) * P(H) \) over all fields.

Bayes' Rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The question does not provide explicit values for these components, so we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. 

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - We may assume uniform prior probabilities for simplicity, but in reality, the proportion of students in various fields can differ. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \) and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's likely that his personality fits well with this field. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \).
   - For computer science: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are important traits for computer science. However, some aspects of his personality like strong empathy and love for animals may not be as directly relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - Calculate the overall probability of the evidence by summing the weighted likelihoods:
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot 0.15 = 0.04 + 0.075 = 0.115
     \]

Now applying Bayesâ€™ rule for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.115} = \frac{0.04}{0.115} \approx 0.348
   \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.15}{0.115} = \frac{0.075}{0.115} \approx 0.652
   \]

Now, let's present these values in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.348,
  "computer science": 0.652
}
