To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem in its general form:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) or the overall evidence \( P(E) \), we can provide qualitative reasoning to make educated guesses for these probabilities.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work—traits more aligned with agricultural and veterinary sciences—we can qualitatively assess that:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is likely high.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is likely lower, as the traits described are less specific to this field.

In addition, the base rate \( P(H) \) for graduate students in these fields should be considered, but since precise data is not provided, we will assume them to be relatively close.

Given these considerations, let's make reasonable estimates:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.8 \]

So the estimated conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect higher alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary sciences, while still acknowledging some possibility for enrollment in computer science.
