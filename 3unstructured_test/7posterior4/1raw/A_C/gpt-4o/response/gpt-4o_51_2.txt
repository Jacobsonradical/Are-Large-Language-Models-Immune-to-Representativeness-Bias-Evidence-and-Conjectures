To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll consider the information provided in the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the initial probability of hypothesis \( H \) before seeing any evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (the total probability of evidence \( E \) under all hypotheses).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make educated guesses based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume there are many students enrolled in computer science, so this prior is reasonably high.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch mentions understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence, which are relevant to computer science. However, the strong curiosity about nature and love for animals might be less indicative of a typical computer science student.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): This field might have fewer students compared to computer science, depending on the university, so the prior might be lower.
   - \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch is highly indicative of someone in agricultural and veterinary science given the genuine curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we'll estimate the probabilities.

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values reflect that, given Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than computer science.
