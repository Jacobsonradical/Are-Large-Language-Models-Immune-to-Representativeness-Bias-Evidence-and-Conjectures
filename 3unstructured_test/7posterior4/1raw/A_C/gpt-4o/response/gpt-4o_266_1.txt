To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam's enrollment in different fields based on his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch (a normalization constant).

Because \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, and without more specific prior distributions, we'll make some educated assumptions based on the given information and intuition.

Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) is a moderate likelihood for both fields, assuming there are many fields Adam could have chosen.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is higher if the field's typical characteristics align well with Adam's personality traits.

Given Adam's traits:
- "Genuine curiosity about nature and plants" and "love for animals" highly align with **agricultural and veterinary science**.
- "High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts" aligns with **computer science**.

Based on these assumptions, we'll estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

Assume:
- \( P(H) \) is roughly the same for both fields (let's denote it as \( P(H) = k \)).
- \( P(E) \) is a constant, which can be factored out in ratios.

We need relative values instead of exact probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is quite high given the alignment with nature, plants, animals, empathy, and dedication.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high due to high intelligence and abstract thinking.

**Let's assign rough estimates**:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \)

For simplicity, we assume uniform priors \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}), P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) due to the lack of specific prior information about Adam.

Calculating ratioed values:

For relative weights:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.8k \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.4k \)

Finally, normalizing these (by taking out \( k \)):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,  // Normalized 0.4 / (0.8 + 0.4)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67  // Normalized 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.4)
}
```

Here, \( total \approx 1 \). This process makes the answers relative to each other and easier to interpret. Note that these estimates are rough and for illustration; realistic numbers require specific priors and more detailed likelihoods.
