To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis, \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \).
3. The overall likelihood of the evidence, \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we'll proceed qualitatively to estimate them.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

Given no other information, we'll assume a uniform distribution for simplicity. However, in reality, prior probabilities would be based on the proportion of graduate students in each field.

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

We'll consider the qualitative matches based on the personality sketch:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: High
- Love for animals: High
- Warm heart and strong empathy: High (important traits for working with animals)
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Balanced fit
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence: Moderate fit (may or may not be a primary trait for this field, but can be beneficial)

#### Computer Science:
- Enjoys solving puzzles: High
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts: High
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Moderate fit (less directly relevant)
- Empathy and love for animals: Low fit (not typically required)
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication: Balanced fit

### Overall Likelihood \( P(E) \)
Given that we have qualitative information, we assume \( P(E) \) to be the same normalization factor for both fields.

### Posterior Conditional Probability \( P(H|E) \)

Let's assign some qualitative scores to the likelihoods:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{Agri}}) \approx 0.8 \) (good fit)
- Computer Science: \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \) (moderate fit)

Given a uniform prior \( P(H_{\text{Agri}}) = P(H_{\text{CS}}) \), let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) for simplicity.

\[ P(H_{\text{Agri}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \approx \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing factors are assumed equal, and thus likely values become their relative magnitudes:

Output values between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,  // approximately 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.3)
  "computer science": 0.43   // approximately 0.3 / (0.4 + 0.3)
}
```

This suggests Adam is slightly more likely to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the provided personality sketch.
