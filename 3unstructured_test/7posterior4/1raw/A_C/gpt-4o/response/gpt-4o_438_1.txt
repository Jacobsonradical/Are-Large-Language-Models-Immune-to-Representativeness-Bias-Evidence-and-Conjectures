To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since we do not have detailed statistical data, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Due to lack of specific prior and likelihood data, we will make subjective estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have the described traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high because of his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \): Without specific data, we'll assume he could reasonably be enrolled in a variety of fields, but his love of nature and animals raises prior probability.
   
   Therefore, let's assume:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
   - \( P(H)\approx 0.15 \) (not too high, as there are many graduate fields)

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that Adam would have the described traits if he were enrolled in computer science is moderate, as his enjoyment of puzzles and intelligence fit well, but his warm heart and love of animals do not specifically align.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field, increasing its prior probability somewhat.

   Therefore, let's assume:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)
   - \( P(H)\approx 0.25 \) (commonly chosen field)

For normalization, let's assume \( P(E) \) is the same for all.

Using estimated values:
1. P(agricultural and veterinary science | E) = \( \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \) ~ adjusted value
2. P(computer science | E) = \( \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \) ~ adjusted value

Let's adjust and give final probabilities assuming an equal distribution (P(E) simplifies the relative comparison).

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21,
  "computer science": 0.10
}
These are indicative values reflecting higher alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science given the nature-centric elements in his personality sketch.
