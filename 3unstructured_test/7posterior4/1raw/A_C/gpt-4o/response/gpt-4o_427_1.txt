To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each hypothesis (field of study) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, so we only need to consider \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for relative comparison.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)): Generally lower since fewer students enroll in this field compared to computer science.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): High, as Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work align well with this field.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior probability (\( P(H) \)): Generally higher given the larger number of students in this field.
   - Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)): Moderate, as Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit, but his interest in nature and animals is less closely related.

Given these considerations, we assign subjective probabilities to reflect the relative likelihoods:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science despite the general higher enrollments in computer science.
