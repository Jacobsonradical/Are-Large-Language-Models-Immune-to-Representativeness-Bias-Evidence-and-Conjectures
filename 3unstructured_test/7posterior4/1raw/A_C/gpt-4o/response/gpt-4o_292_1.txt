To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

In the context of the problem, we need to estimate \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume some general data; agricultural and veterinary sciences might have a lower overall enrollment compared to more common fields like computer science. So, we'll place a relatively low prior probability here, for example, \( P(H) = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality sketch, the probability that he would be in this field is relatively high because of his love for nature and animals. We'll estimate a high likelihood, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of encountering someone with Adam's personality sketch across all fields. Since we don't have exact data, we'll treat \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant to ensure the probabilities reasonably reflect the given traits.

### Computer Science:
- \( P(H) \): This is the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in computer science. Given the large number of students in this field, we'll place a higher prior probability, say \( P(H) = 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for puzzles, high intelligence, and abstract thinking, the probability he is in computer science is also relatively high. We can estimate this as \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \).
- \( P(E) \): As for agricultural and veterinary science, this remains a normalizing constant.

Given that we are focusing on the relative scale without detailed statistical data for normalization, we'll ignore \( P(E) \) and focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Calculations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.04 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.3 \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.21 \]

Normalizing these values to sum approximately to 1 for simplicity:

Total = 0.04 + 0.21 = 0.25.

Therefore, the normalized probabilities are:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.25} = 0.16 \]

#### Computer Science:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.21}{0.25} = 0.84 \]
