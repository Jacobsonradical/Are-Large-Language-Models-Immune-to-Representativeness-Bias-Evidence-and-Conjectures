To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or computer science, we'll use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have explicit values for the likelihoods and priors, we can make reasoned qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch. Here are some considerations:

1. **P(E|H) - Likelihood:**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The sketch highlights Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which are highly consistent with someone studying this field.
   - **Computer Science:** The sketch mentions Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which align well with this field. However, his love for nature and animals is less directly relevant.

2. **P(H) - Prior Probability:**
   - Without explicit prior data, we use general knowledge. Agricultural and veterinary science programs are less commonly chosen than computer science programs.
   
3. **P(E) - Evidence:**
   - The evidence, E, is constant for both calculations, so we can focus on the relative likelihoods and priors.

Given these considerations, let's assign some relative values to these components for normalization:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science Likelihood (P(E|H)):** High (let's assume 0.7)
- **Computer Science Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Moderate (let's assume 0.4)

- **Prior Probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (P(H)):** Lower (let's assume 0.2)
- **Prior Probability for Computer Science (P(H)):** Higher (let's assume 0.6)

Using Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AgSci}) \cdot P(\text{AgSci})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer Science:**

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.6}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, we only need the numerators to compare the relative probabilities:

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) \approx 0.14 \]

For Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.24 \]

Normalized (optional step, not necessary due to stated instructions):

\[ \text{Total} = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(\text{AgSci}|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.38} \approx 0.37 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.24}{0.38} \approx 0.63 \]

Given these estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.37,
  "computer science": 0.63
}
```

These values represent the relative probabilities derived from the personality sketch and our reasoned assumptions about the fields.
