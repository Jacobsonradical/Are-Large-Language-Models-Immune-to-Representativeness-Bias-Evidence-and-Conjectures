To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality traits given each field, the prior probabilities of being enrolled in each field, and the normalizing constant. To simplify, we'll assume equal priors since we don't have specific data to inform them.

Given Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \), the posterior probability simplifies to be proportional to the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

For:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
2. **Computer Science (H2)**

Let's qualitatively evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, interest in plants, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work also fit, considering the rigor often required in these studies.
- **Computer Science**: His intelligence and skill at abstract concepts, as well as puzzle-solving abilities, align well with this field. However, the personality traits related to curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals are less relevant to computer science.

Given this qualitative evaluation:

\[ P(E|H1) > P(E|H2) \]

Since we are not given explicit probabilities but can give a reasonably informed guess, let's assign:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are not precise but indicate that given Adam's described traits, he is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than computer science in 2021.
