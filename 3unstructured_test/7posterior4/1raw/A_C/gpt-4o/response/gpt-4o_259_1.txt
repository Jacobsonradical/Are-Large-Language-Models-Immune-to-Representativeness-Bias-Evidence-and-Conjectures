To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we are looking for.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
   - \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

2. **Estimate Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For computer science: Given Adam's characteristics, the likelihood might be lower because the typical personality sketch for a computer science student doesn't necessarily align with an emphasis on nature, plants, and animals. However, empathy and problem-solving skills are beneficial in computer science.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: The likelihood seems higher given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which fits well with the principles of agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Estimate Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) can be considered based on the general proportion of graduate students in each field.

Without exact statistics and for the purpose of the exercise, we must make reasonable assumptions for simplification:

\[
P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) \approx 0.2
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}) \approx 0.05
\]

4. **Estimate Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - Summing over all hypotheses, but here we'll assume it normalizes relatively since other fields are not considered.

Now, let's input reasonable guesses for the likelihood based on qualitative alignment:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \approx 0.3
\]
\[
P(E|H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}) \approx 0.8
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations and will serve as a normalization factor for all graduate fields, we simplify with:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp sci}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}})
\]

Thus, we compute each posterior probability:

1. For computer science:
\[
P(H_{\text{comp sci}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{comp sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp sci}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{\text{Normalizing Factor}}
\]

2. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{\text{Normalizing Factor}}
\]

After normalizing correctly to the marginal \( P(E) \), we get approximate ratios:

\[
P(H_{\text{comp sci}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{\text{Normalization Factor}}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{\text{Normalization Factor}}
\]

However, assuming normalization won't change ratios drastically, we can evaluate:

\[
P(H_{\text{comp sci}}|E) \approx 0.43
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri and vet sci}}|E) \approx 0.57
\]

Thus, our approximate results would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.43,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57
}
```
