To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the Hypotheses**:
   - \( H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( H_{\text{computer science}} \): Adam is enrolled in computer science.
   
2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - These are the initial probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering his personality traits. Without specific prior data, we assume equal priors, but they can be updated if additional data is provided.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - These are the probabilities of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.

4. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - The total probability of observing the personality traits, which can be decomposed into the sum of the product of priors and likelihoods over all hypotheses.
   
Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) Estimations:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
  - Warm heart and strong empathy.
  - Deep love for animals.
  - High appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  
  These traits are highly consistent with someone in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Enjoys solving puzzles.
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.

  While some traits fit computer science (e.g., puzzles, high intelligence), the matching isn't as strong for empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature. Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.

### Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \) (assuming equal priors since no specific data)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.9 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.6 \)

### Calculation:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \]
\[ = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.6 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ = 0.45 + 0.3 \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.75} = \frac{0.45}{0.75} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.5}{0.75} = \frac{0.3}{0.75} = 0.4 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```
