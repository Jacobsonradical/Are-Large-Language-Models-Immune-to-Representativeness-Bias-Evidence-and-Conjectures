To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume:

1. \( P(Agricultural \ and \ Veterinary \ Science) = P(H_{AVG}) \)
2. \( P(Computer \ Science) = P(H_{CS}) \)
3. \( P(E|Agricultural \ and \ Veterinary \ Science) = P(E|H_{AVG}) \)
4. \( P(E|Computer \ Science) = P(E|H_{CS}) \)

Given the personality sketch E, which suggests a strong interest in nature, animals, and a high intelligence, we can reasonably hypothesize:

\[ P(E|H_{AVG}) > P(E|H_{CS}) \]

However, without specific numerical values for the probabilities, we will have to make reasoned estimates. Assume:
- There is a higher probability \( P(E|H_{AVG}) \) given Adam's love for nature and animals.
- There is a moderate probability \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.

For \( P(H_{AVG}) \) and \( P(H_{CS}) \), we assume a prior assignment, i.e., the choice of agricultural and veterinary science and computer science among all graduate fields. Letâ€™s assume that these two fields are equally popular among graduate fields; thus, probabilities \( P(H_{AVG}) \) and \( P(H_{CS}) \) are both 0.5 for simplification.

For this simplified calculation, assume \( P(E) \) remains constant.

Hence,
\[ P(H_{AVG}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVG}) \cdot P(H_{AVG})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.35 / P(E) \]

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = 0.15 / P(E) \]

After normalizing this (assuming \( P(E) \) balances to 1), we would informally:

\[ P(H_{AVG}|E) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.3 \]

By normalization and furtherance on evaluations, we can approximate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
