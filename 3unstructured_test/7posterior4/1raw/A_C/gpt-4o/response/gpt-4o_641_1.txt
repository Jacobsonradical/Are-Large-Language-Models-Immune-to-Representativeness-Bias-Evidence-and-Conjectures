To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \), and the prior probability of each hypothesis. Since we don't have specific numerical values, we will qualitatively approximate the likelihood based on the provided personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), let's estimate the posterior probabilities.

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \)**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals. These traits align very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H_1) \) is relatively high.
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \)**: While we don't have specific data, agricultural and veterinary science is a somewhat common field but less so than computer science in the U.S.

### Hypothesis 2: Computer Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are strong indicators of computer science aptitude. However, the other traits related to nature, plants, and animals are less directly relevant to computer science. Therefore, \( P(E|H_2) \) is moderate.
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \)**: Computer science is an extremely popular field of study, so \( P(H_2) \) is relatively high.

### Posterior Probabilities Estimation
Given the observations above:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - High likelihood due to alignment with Adam's interests and traits.
   - Moderate prior probability due to being less common than computer science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Moderate likelihood due to solving puzzles and intelligence but lower alignment with nature-related traits.
   - High prior probability due to the popularity of the field.

Let's denote the qualitative assessments into rough numerical values between 0 and 1 subject to the lack of concrete data:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values represent the overall assessment of how well the personality sketch fits each field, considering both the likelihood of the evidence and the prior probabilities.

Note: The actual numerical values depend on more precise priors and likelihoods, which are not provided in this context. So, the values given are subjective estimates based on qualitative reasoning.
