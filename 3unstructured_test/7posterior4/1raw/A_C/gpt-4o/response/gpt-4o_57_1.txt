To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of a hypothesis \( H \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's make some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities involved:

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Suppose there is a 20% chance a graduate student is in Computer Science.
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Suppose there is a 10% chance a graduate student is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it's more likely for a student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science to have these interests. Let's assume:
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the normalization factor, but to simplify the calculations, we will focus on the relative comparison.

Using these assumptions, we can now calculate the posterior probabilities:

### Calculations:

1. **For Computer Science**:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Since we are asked to provide the values without normalizing, here are the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These values indicate that, given Adam's personality sketch, it's more likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Computer Science in 2021.
