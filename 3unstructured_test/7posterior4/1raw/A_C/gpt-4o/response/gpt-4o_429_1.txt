To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule for each of the given fields (H), we would typically use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (Adam enrolled in the field).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

For simplicity and given that exact numerical priors \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are often hard to determine without empirical data, we'll use reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science**: This field often involves solving puzzles and abstract concepts, which matches Adam's high intelligence and skills. However, it does not directly relate to empathy, love for animals, or dedication to nature.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely matches Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and dedication. While it might not focus extensively on abstract concepts or puzzles, aspects of these could still be relevant.

### Approximate Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Let's assume there's a moderate likelihood that someone with Adam's traits (intelligence, puzzle-solving) would be in this field. Assign a probability of 0.3.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Let's assume a high likelihood given the alignment of the traits with the field. Assign a probability of 0.7.

### Prior Probabilities:
- Without specific demographic or empirical data, we may assume equal priors or base our priors on common sense or known distributions of students in these fields.
- However, for illustrative purposes, let's assume:
  - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.25 \) (many students in this field).
  - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.10 \).

### Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \):
- This can be ignored for relative comparison, as \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields.

### Posterior Calculation:
Let's compute the posterior for each:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} = 0.075 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)} = 0.07 \]

So, relative to each other and without normalizing:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.075,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

##### Note:
These numerical values are illustrative and depend heavily on the prior assumptions made. A more accurate calculation would require actual data distribution on students with traits matching Adamâ€™s.
