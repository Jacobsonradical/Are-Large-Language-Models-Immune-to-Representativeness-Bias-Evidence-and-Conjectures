Computing the exact posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for Adam's enrollment in specific fields given his personality sketch requires knowing prior probabilities and likelihoods that typically involve extensive data and domain knowledge. Since I don't have access to specific data on the distribution of graduate students across different fields or detailed likelihood values, any estimates would be speculative. Nonetheless, I can provide a high-level reasoning and approximate values based on conventional stereotypes and assumptions.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\).

### Assumptions and Reasoning

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are strong indicators that he might be interested in this field.
   - Given this alignment, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is quite high.
   - The prior probability \(P(H)\) for agricultural and veterinary science enrollment might not be exceedingly high across all graduate students, but the likelihood factors strongly here.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adamâ€™s enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence suggest that he might have the skills suited for computer science.
   - However, there is less direct evidence connecting his love for nature and animals to computer science, leading to a lower likelihood \(P(E|H)\).
   - The prior probability \(P(H)\) for computer science enrollment might be relatively high given the popularity of this field.

Using these considerations, the resulting posterior conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values imply that, based on the personality sketch provided, it is more probable that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, though both fields remain possible. The actual values might vary with more specific data, but these approximations follow the personality traits given.
