To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the fundamental components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true before considering the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

In the absence of specific prior probabilities, we need to make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch.

Given the information:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Based on the profile:

- For computer science: Analytical and abstract reasoning are very important, so the high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well.
- For agricultural and veterinary science: A love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy are key indicators.

Given these points, let's assign qualitative likelihoods and use them to express posterior probabilities. While we don't have numerical priors, the personality aligns more clearly with nature-related fields upon qualitative assessment.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \] is lower compared to horticulture or veterinary sciences because the explicit interest in nature and animals is not a strong fit for computer science, although abstract reasoning and intelligence apply.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \] is higher due to strong emotional and intellectual alignment.

Assuming non-specific priors for each field, we qualitatively conclude:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Here, values between 0 and 1 reflect our reasoned judgment based on the narrative alignment with each field's typical requirements.
