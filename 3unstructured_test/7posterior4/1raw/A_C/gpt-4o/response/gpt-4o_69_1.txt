To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given evidence under each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete prior probabilities and specific details on likelihoods, we'll use educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch and typical field characteristics.

### Assumptions and Estimations

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: 
   These would be the general probabilities of a student enrolling in each field if we had concrete data. For the sake of estimation, let's assume:
   - Computer Science is quite popular; we will assume a prior probability of \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.30 \).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences are less popular but fit well with Adam's interests; we'll assume \( P(\text{AG and VS}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   This describes how well the evidence (personality sketch) fits with each hypothesis.
   
   - For **Computer Science**:
     - Curiosity about nature (0.1, as it's not directly related).
     - Solving puzzles (0.7, as it fits well with CS).
     - Warm heart and strong empathy (0.2, less directly related).
     - Love for animals (0.1, less directly related).
     - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts (0.8, fits well with CS).
     - Appreciation for hard work (0.7, generally positive but not specific to CS).
     - Combining these, let's estimate \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.40 \).
   
   - For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     - Curiosity about nature (0.8, highly relevant).
     - Solving puzzles (0.5, indirectly relevant).
     - Warm heart and empathy (0.8, fits well).
     - Love for animals (0.9, highly relevant).
     - High intelligence and abstract concepts (0.5, as research is involved but not as abstract as CS).
     - Appreciation for hard work (0.8, very relevant).
     - Combining these, let's estimate \( P(E|\text{AG and VS}) \approx 0.75 \).

Since we do not have details on \( P(E) \) directly, we'll compare the two fields using:

\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{AG and VS}}|E)} = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E|H_{\text{AG and VS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AG and VS}})} \]

### Posterior Calculation:
Given:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.40 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{AG and VS}}) \approx 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AG and VS}}) = 0.15 \]

Using these:
\[ \frac{P(H_{\text{CS}}|E)}{P(H_{\text{AG and VS}}|E)} = \frac{0.40 \times 0.30}{0.75 \times 0.15} = \frac{0.12}{0.1125} \approx 1.07 \]

This ratio approximates the relative likelihood of the two hypotheses.

### Final Posterior Probabilities:
Given this ratio and the initial priors, we'll normalize them approximately.

- Normalize probabilities such that:
  - For Computer Science: \( P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \sim 0.52 \)
  - For Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences: \( P(H_{\text{AG and VS}}|E) \sim 0.48 \)

Final estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.52,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.48
}
```

Note: These values are an approximation based on assumed prior probabilities and estimated likelihoods.
