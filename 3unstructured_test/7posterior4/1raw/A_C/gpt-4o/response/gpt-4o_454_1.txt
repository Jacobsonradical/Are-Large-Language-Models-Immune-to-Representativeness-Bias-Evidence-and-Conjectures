To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. Specifically:
- \(P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\), where:
  - \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
  - \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
  - \(P(E)\) is the probability of evidence \(E\).

Without specific data on the priors and likelihoods, we can provide an informed estimate based on the personality sketch of Adam.

### Step-by-step Estimation

1. **P(H|E) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: 
     - It is fairly common for students interested in nature, plants, and animals to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
     - The evidence fits well with this field. High empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants all align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**:
     - While the exact numeric value is challenging without specific data, given the strong alignment, we estimate a relatively high probability.

2. **P(H|E) for Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
     - Computer science is a very popular field among graduate studies; hence, many students might be found in this field.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
     - The evidence somewhat fits. Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science.
     - However, attributes like strong empathy, love for nature, plants, and animals are less directly related to computer science.
   - **Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\)**:
     - The probability is reasonable but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science because the match isn't as strong for some key personality aspects.

### Estimated Posterior Probabilities

Based on the qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Please note these values are informed estimates and should be interpreted within the context of available qualitative information rather than precise numeric data.
