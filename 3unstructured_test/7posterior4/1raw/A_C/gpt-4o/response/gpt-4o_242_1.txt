To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities of each field \( P(H) \), the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). In this context, however, we don't have concrete numerical priors or likelihoods, so our approach will be qualitative and based on the provided personality sketch.

### Applying Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since specific numerical values are missing, we will base our evaluation on the relative fit between Adam's personality sketch and the typical traits for each field.

### Assessment:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁)**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H₁) \)**: Let's assume it's moderate for graduate students in general, given it's a less common field than some others.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H₁) \)**:
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants: High match.
     - Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: High match.
     - High intelligence and abstract thinking: Beneficial but not specifically indicative.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: High match.

   Given these strong matches, \( P(E|H₁) \) is relatively high.

2. **Computer Science (H₂)**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H₂) \)**: Higher, as computer science is a very popular field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H₂) \)**:
     - Enjoys solving puzzles: High match.
     - High intelligence and abstract thinking: High match.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication: Medium match.
     - Curiosity about nature and plants, warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Not directly relevant.

   Here, the likelihood \( P(E|H₂) \) is moderate to high, but lower than for H₁.

### Qualitative Conclusion:
- \( P(H₁|E) \) is likely high due to strong alignment with specific traits.
- \( P(H₂|E) \) is moderate due to partial alignment but not a perfect fit.

Thus, our qualitative posterior probabilities are:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
