To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of obtaining the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) before considering the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

To solve for these probabilities, reasonable assumptions must be made regarding \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). While exact numerical values are not provided, their qualitative assessment allows estimation of relative values based on the given personality sketch. More concrete numerical values would require empirical data, but we proceed based on subjective analysis:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, as it is a common field but not overwhelmingly so.
   - \( P(E) \): Considerable, though influenced by the overall number of graduate programs available.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence, but lower due to emphasis on nature and animals.
   - \( P(H) \): High, given the popularity of computer science as a graduate field.
   - \( P(E) \): Considerable, same as above.

Based on these qualitative judgments:

\[ \begin{align*}
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) & \approx \frac{\text{high} \cdot \text{moderate}}{\text{considerable}} \quad \rightarrow \text{high-moderate estimate} \\
P(\text{computer science} | E) & \approx \frac{\text{moderate} \cdot \text{high}}{\text{considerable}} \quad \rightarrow \text{moderate-high estimate}
\end{align*} \]

Given these, we can provide the following relative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.72,
  "computer science": 0.45
}
```

These reflect qualitative relative likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch, where agricultural and veterinary science has a higher posterior probability compared to computer science, although not exhaustively quantitative due to subjective initial estimates.
