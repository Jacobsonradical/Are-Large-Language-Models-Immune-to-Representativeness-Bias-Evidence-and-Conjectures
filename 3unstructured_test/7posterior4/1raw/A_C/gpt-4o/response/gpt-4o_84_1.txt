To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihood, which are not provided explicitly. However, I can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on the description given in the personality sketch of Adam (\( E \)).

Bayes' formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the personality sketch overall.

Without specific numeric values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll make informed guesses based on the personality traits relevant to each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: Adam has a strong love for animals and nature, which aligns well with this field.
- **P(H)**: Assume a moderate prior probability because this field is less common among all graduate fields in the U.S. but fits well with Adam's interests.

### Computer Science
- **P(E|H)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, fitting well with the problem-solving aspect of computer science. However, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are less directly related to this field.
- **P(H)**: Assume a higher prior probability since computer science is a very popular field among graduate students in the U.S.

Combining these considerations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values reflect a qualitative assessment rather than precise computation, given the lack of specific numerical data.
