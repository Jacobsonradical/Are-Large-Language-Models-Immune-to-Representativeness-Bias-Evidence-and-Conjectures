To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in computer science and agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to explicitly compute these probabilities, we would need detailed information about:
1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field (computer science and agricultural and veterinary science).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of having the described personality if Adam were in each field.
3. The overall probability \( P(E) \) of having the described personality sketch.

Since we don't have these specific values, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch \( E \). 

Given the data:
- Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals," suggesting a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- The attributes of "high intelligence" and being "good at understanding abstract concepts" could be indicators for both fields, though they might slightly favor computer science.
- The "warm heart" and "strong empathy" might lean more towards fields dealing with living beings.

Given these qualitative assessments, I'll provide reasonable estimates:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{computer science} | E) & \approx 0.3 \quad \text{(since some traits fit, but not all directly)}\\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) & \approx 0.7 \quad \text{(since more traits align well)}
\end{align*}
\]

So a reasonable approximation could be formatted as:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality sketch to the general characteristics expected in these fields. Without specific data, these probabilities are estimates rather than precise calculations.
