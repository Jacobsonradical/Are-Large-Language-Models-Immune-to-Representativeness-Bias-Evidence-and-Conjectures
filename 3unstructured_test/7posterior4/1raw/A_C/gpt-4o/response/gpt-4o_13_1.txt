To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study (agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's break this process down for each field. Since exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, we will make some qualitative assumptions based on the given personality sketch (E) and general knowledge about the fields (H).

### Assumptions

1. **P(E)**: The prior probability of Adam's personality sketch which remains the same across all fields.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student being in each field based on general statistics or reasonable assumptions.
3. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given the field of study.

### Qualitative Estimations

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **P(E|H)**: High likelihood as Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy fit well.
2. **P(H)**: Moderate probability, as agricultural and veterinary science enrolls fewer graduate students compared to more common fields like computer science.
3. **P(E)**: Shared denominator in this context; hence relative comparison is sufficient.

**Computer Science:**
1. **P(E|H)**: Moderate to low likelihood since while Adam's high intelligence and abstract concept understanding fit, his primary interests in nature and animals are less aligned.
2. **P(H)**: High probability, given the popularity and high enrollment numbers in computer science.
3. **P(E)**: Shared denominator.

Given these assumptions, let's estimate the conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

In this qualitative assessment:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** gets a higher probability (0.7) due to better alignment with Adam's interests and traits.
- **Computer Science** gets a lower probability (0.2) due to lesser alignment, despite being a popular field.
