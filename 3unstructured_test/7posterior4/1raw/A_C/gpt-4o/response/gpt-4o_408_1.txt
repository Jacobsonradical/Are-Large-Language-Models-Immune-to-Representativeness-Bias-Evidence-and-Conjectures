Bayes' rule allows us to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) from the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Given the personality sketch of Adam (denoted as \( E \)), we'll need to make some assumptions about these probabilities to compute the posterior conditional probability.

For simplicity, let's assume:
1. \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of being enrolled in either field) is initially equal for both fields.
2. \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given the field) based on our qualitative understanding of how well the sketch fits each field.

Given these assumptions:
- The traits of a deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, and understanding of hard work align more closely with "agricultural and veterinary science."
- High intelligence and abstract thinking fit well with "computer science," but the explicit mention of nature and animals makes this less likely.

Let's outline the rough likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field:
- \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \) (high, because the traits directly align with the field).
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) = 0.2 \) (low, because the traits are less specific to computer science).

By Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \( P(H) \) is equal (say 0.5 for simplicity) and given our likelihoods, the posterior probabilities are proportionate to the likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Therefore, we can approximate the relative weights:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \]

To normalize (if we needed probabilities adding up to 1, which isn't necessary here but helps visualization):

\[ 
\text{Sum} = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Given that total normalization is not required by the problem statement, we provide the raw proportions:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
