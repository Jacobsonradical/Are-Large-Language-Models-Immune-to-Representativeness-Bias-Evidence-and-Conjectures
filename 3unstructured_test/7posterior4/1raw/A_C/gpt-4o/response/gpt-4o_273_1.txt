To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):** The total probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific data, I'll provide a reasoned approach based on typical interpretations of these fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{agric}) \)**: Let's assume that the proportion of graduate students in this field is about 5%.
   
   \( P(H_{agric}) = 0.05 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{agric}) \)**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which are highly relevant in agricultural and veterinary science.
   
   \( P(E|H_{agric}) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood)

### Computer Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H_{cs}) \)**: Let's assume that the proportion of graduate students in computer science is about 15%.
   
   \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.15 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence are relevant in computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less directly applicable.
   
   \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.4 \) (moderate likelihood)

### Evidence \( P(E) \)
To compute the evidence, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agric}) \cdot P(H_{agric}) + P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + \text{(other fields)} \]

Assuming that agricultural and veterinary science, and computer science significantly affect \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.05 + 0.4 \times 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.10 \]

### Posterior Probabilities

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   
   \[ P(H_{agric}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agric}) \cdot P(H_{agric})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{agric}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.10} \]
   \[ P(H_{agric}|E) = 0.4 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.10} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = 0.6 \]

Please note that these probabilities are illustrative estimates based on the provided data and assumptions about prior distributions and likelihoods. In a real-world scenario, exact numbers would need more detailed statistical data.
