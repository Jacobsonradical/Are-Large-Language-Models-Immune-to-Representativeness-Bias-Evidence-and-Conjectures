To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). However, we do not have direct numerical values for these probabilities. Instead, we can qualitatively reason about them based on the given personality sketch \(E\).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

Let's qualitatively assess the likelihood for each field given Adam's personality sketch \(E\):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Strong alignment with agricultural sciences.
2. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: Strong alignment with veterinary science.
3. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Helpful in any graduate field.
4. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work**: Could fit any demanding field but is often essential in hands-on fields like agriculture and veterinary science.

Thus, itâ€™s highly likely that \(P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science})\) is high.

### Computer Science
1. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Good fit for computer science.
2. **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts**: Very fitting for computer science.
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**: Less directly relevant, but doesn't exclude the possibility.

Thus, \(P(E|\text{computer science})\) is reasonably high but not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.

Without specific priors \(P(H)\), we can only provide qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities.

Given our qualitative analysis, let's assign subjective probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

These values reflect the stronger fit of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science as compared to computer science, based on the evidence provided.
