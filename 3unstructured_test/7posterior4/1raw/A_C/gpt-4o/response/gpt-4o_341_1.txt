To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

Since we don't have specific quantitative values for these probabilities, we will make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the information provided.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, puzzle-solving, empathy) are not strongly indicative of a typical Computer Science student. We might assign a lower value here.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Computer Science is a common graduate field; we might assume an average prior.
   - \( P(E) \): Overall, the evidence describes someone who might fit better in other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adamâ€™s strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about plants fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): This is a less common graduate field compared to Computer Science.
   - \( P(E) \): While these qualities can be part of various fields, they are strongly aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Now, qualitatively, let's approximate the probabilities:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
