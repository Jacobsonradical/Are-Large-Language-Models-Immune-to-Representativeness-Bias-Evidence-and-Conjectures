To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the enrollment in each field, and the overall probability of observing \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field, we will analyze the probabilities qualitatively since exact numerical data is not provided.

**1. Computer Science**

- **Prior \( P(H) \):** Considering the popularity of computer science as a graduate field, we can assume a moderate prior for Adam being enrolled in this field.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Computer science students can have high intelligence and good problem-solving skills, aligning with Adam's traits. However, the strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work might be less emphasized in this field.
  
Given the mixed alignment of Adam's traits with typical computer science students, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.

**2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- **Prior \( P(H) \):** This field is less common, so the prior might be considered low compared to more general fields.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** His genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, understanding of hard work, and high intelligence fit very well with this field. 

Given the strong alignment of Adam's traits with those required in agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(E|H) \) is high.

While exact values for these probabilities are not provided, we can infer the relative likelihoods as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This reflects the strong alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science, in contrast with the moderate alignment with computer science. Please note these are qualitative estimates and could be refined with more specific data.
