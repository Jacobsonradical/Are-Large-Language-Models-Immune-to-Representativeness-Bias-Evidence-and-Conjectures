To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, let's break it down analytically and intuitively. We will use the following equation of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability of Adam being in a particular field before considering his personality sketch. This can be roughly estimated based on general statistics about graduate students in different fields, although exact values vary widely.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability that we would observe Adam's personality sketch if he were in that field. This is assessed based on how well Adam's characteristics fit with each field.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields. This is generally uniform across different hypotheses. For the sake of this example, we assume it to be a normalizing constant.

### Estimation:

#### Computer Science

- **P(H)**: Graduate programs in computer science are common, so Adam has a decent chance of being in this field.
- **P(E|H)**: Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with a computer science profile. However, his strong empathy and deep love for animals are not typical for this field.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **P(H)**: This field is less commonly chosen compared to computer science, but not uncommon either.
- **P(E|H)**: Adamâ€™s strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are highly indicative of this field. His personality traits fit exceptionally well.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri/vet}}) = 0.9 \]

### Result Calculation:

#### Normalizing Factor \( P(E) \)

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we assume it adjusts to normalize our computations. We'll focus on relative probabilities for simplicity.

### Posterior Calculation:

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.3 = 0.12 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agri/vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

### Normalization
To normalize (if needed):

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.18} \approx 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}|E)_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{0.18}{0.12 + 0.18} \approx 0.6 \]

However, as requested, only provide approximate values without necessarily normalizing to the sum of 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.12",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.18"
}
```

These values give a relative measure of how likely Adam is to be in each graduate program based on his personality sketch.
