To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probabilities and likelihoods of each hypothesis given the evidence. However, I can provide a qualitative estimate based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the qualitative nature of the data, let's make reasoned estimates for the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the evidence available. 

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, it's reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H_{agr}) \) is fairly high for agricultural and veterinary science.

**For Computer Science:**
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
- He is of high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.

These traits align well with the qualities beneficial for a field like computer science, suggesting that the likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) is also fairly high, but perhaps not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science, considering the additional specific interest in nature and animals.

Based on these reasoned estimates, we can provide rough qualitative estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These estimates suggest that given the personality sketch provided, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in computer science, though there is still a reasonable possibility that he could be in computer science. Note that in a more rigorous statistical setting, precise prior probabilities and likelihoods based on empirical data would be necessary to compute accurate posterior probabilities.
