To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
1. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific graduate field given his personality sketch \( E \).
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that graduate field.
3. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that graduate field.
4. \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probabilities are equal for each graduate field, i.e., \( P(H) \) is the same for both. Hence, we can focus on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), as the denominator \( P(E) \) will be common across all fields.

## Likelihoods based on Adamâ€™s personality sketch \( E \):

### Computer Science
1. Curiosity about nature and plants: Less aligned
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Aligned
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Less typically aligned
4. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Strongly aligned
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Neutral

Given these points, let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderately low.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. Curiosity about nature and plants: Strongly aligned
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: Neutral
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Strongly aligned
4. High intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Neutral to aligned
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Strongly aligned

Given these points, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is moderately high.

Given that our priors are equal, we should consider that the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) would play the determining role here.

## Calculation
Since exact values are not provided and we need to use qualitative assessments:

- **Computer Science**: Moderately low likelihood due to points 1 and 3 not aligning well.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Moderately high likelihood due to points 1, 3, and 5 strongly aligning.

Given that:
- Moderately low likelihood: ~0.2
- Moderately high likelihood: ~0.7

This allows us to provide the following posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
