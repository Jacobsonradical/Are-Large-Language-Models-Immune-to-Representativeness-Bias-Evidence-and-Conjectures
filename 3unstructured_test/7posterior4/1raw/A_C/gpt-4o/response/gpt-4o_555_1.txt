To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

In order to calculate specific values, we would need the exact probabilities that may not be easily obtainable without domain-specific data. However, we can make qualitative judgments based on the description provided and general knowledge.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch if he is a computer science student. High intelligence and good abstraction skills support this.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability of being a computer science student could be approximated by the general proportion of graduate students in this field.
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of encountering someone with the personality sketch described.

   Given Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence, but considering his strong empathy, connection to nature, and love for animals, this field might be less supported than others.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \): The likelihood of Adam having the described personality if he is an agricultural or veterinary science student seems high given his curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals.
   - \( P(H_{AgVet}) \): The prior probability of being in agricultural or veterinary science could be approximated by the general proportion of graduate students in this field.
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of encountering someone with the personality sketch described.

   Given the strong alignment of his interests and attributes with this field, this seems quite plausible.

Without exact numerical data but aiming for a reasonable qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch and general trends, here is a likely answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

The values are chosen to reflect the fact that while Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills could align with computer science, his other attributes strongly suggest alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
