To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Finding exact numerical values requires more specific data about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, we can provide qualitative probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students enrolled in these fields.

Considering the personality sketch for Adam, let's analyze each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that align with the analytical and problem-solving skills required in computer science.
   - However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and specific interest in nature and plants are less indicative of a typical computer science student.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with this field.
   - His empathy and warm heart further align with the caring nature required in veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments, the probabilities can be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

This estimation assumes that while Adam's problem-solving ability makes computer science a plausible field, his defining characteristics more strongly align him with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
