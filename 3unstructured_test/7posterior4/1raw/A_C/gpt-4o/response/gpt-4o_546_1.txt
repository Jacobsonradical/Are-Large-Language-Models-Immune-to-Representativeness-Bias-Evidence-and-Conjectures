To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'd need to use Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality traits given he is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having those personality traits, which acts as a normalizing factor.

Without specific values or data, we can only provide qualitative probabilistic estimates based on the personality sketch and typical personality-trait associations with each field.

Given the characteristics in Adam's personality sketch, we can make some reasonable assumptions:
- Adam has a strong empathy and a love for animals, which are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
- Intelligence and abstract thinking are valuable for many fields but are particularly emphasized in computer science.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication can be pertinent to both fields.
- His curiosity about nature and plants seems highly relevant to agricultural science.

Here are the qualitative estimates based on these assumptions:

- **Computer Science**: People in computer science fields are often characterized by high intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam has. However, the other personality traits such as empathy, a love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less directly related to computer science. Thus, while there is a non-negligible probability, it is not as high as for agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's empathy, genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are very closely aligned with traits beneficial for this field. Therefore, the probability is significantly higher.

Given this, our qualitative estimates might look something like:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are hypothetical and based on qualitative reasoning rather than quantitative data. To make accurate computations, we'd need specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.
