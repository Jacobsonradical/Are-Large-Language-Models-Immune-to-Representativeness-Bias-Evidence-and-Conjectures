To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field, we would typically use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H (i.e., the general probability of students being in that field).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence E.

However, specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are typically necessary to perform this calculation precisely. Without concrete data, we'll make some educated estimates based on the description provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Strong alignment with curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work in nature-related fields.
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)) is relatively high.
   - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \).

2. **P(E|H) for Computer Science**: 
   - Alignment with high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and puzzle-solving.
   - Lower alignment with love for nature and animals.
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)) is moderately high.
   - Assume \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Prior probabilities (P(H))**: 
   - Assume students are equally likely to be in any field without concrete data.
   - If equal probability is assumed for simplification, then \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \) for both fields.

4. **P(E)** is a normalization factor and should be the same for both fields. Thus, it would cancel out when we're only interested in comparing the relative probabilities.

Given these assumptions:
\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \times P(H) \]

### Calculations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \times 0.5 = 0.35 \]

2. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior conditional probabilities can be approximated as follows:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
