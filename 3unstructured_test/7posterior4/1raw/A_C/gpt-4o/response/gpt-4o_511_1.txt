To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we typically require prior probabilities and likelihood values. However, since these values are not provided, we will make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and estimate the posterior probabilities based on reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of Adam fitting into each field.

Given the subject's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals, we can reasonably infer that the likelihood \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is high. His warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also support this inference.

On the other hand, the subject's quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts make computer science a plausible field but not as evidently aligned with all his described characteristics.

Thus, while an exact numeric computation would require more detailed data, we can propose a relative probability based on qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This estimation considers the stronger alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science, compared to computer science. Adjustments can be made if actual prior probabilities and other relevant data are provided.
