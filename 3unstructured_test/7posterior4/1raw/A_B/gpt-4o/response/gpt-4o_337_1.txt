To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) generally.

We need to make some assumptions in the absence of concrete data:
1. \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \): Given that Adam was in business administration, the probability of observing his personality traits.
2. \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \): Given that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science, the probability of observing his personality traits.
3. \( P(H_{business\ administration}) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in business administration.
4. \( P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
5. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch, considering all possible fields of specialization.

Intuitively:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align more closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- A personality trait of enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence could align with either field but might be less indicative of business administration given the stronger alignment with nature and animals.

Given these points, let's make some educated guesses about the probabilities:

\[ P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \approx 0.9 \]

For the priors:
- Business administration is a common graduate field, but considering Adam's unique traits, let's assume:
\[ P(H_{business\ administration}) \approx 0.3 \]

- Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but more aligned with Adam's interests:
\[ P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \approx 0.2 \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \) (though the exact value isn't necessary for comparison purposes):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \cdot P(H_{business\ administration}) + P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) + \text{other fields} \]

Though we don't have the numeric value for "other fields," we can still compare relative values.

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \) for relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E)_{business\ administration} \approx 0.03 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science} \approx 0.18 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18
}
```
