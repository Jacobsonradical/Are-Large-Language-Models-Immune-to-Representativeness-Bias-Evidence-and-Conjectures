To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis and the prior probability of each hypothesis. The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete data for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), exact numerical values cannot be calculated. Instead, we can rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate the probabilities.

### Qualitative Reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - His love for animals.
   - His empathy and warm heart, which align with animal care.

   Given these traits, it is highly plausible that Adam would be in an agricultural and veterinary science field. These alignments indicate a relatively high \( P(E|H) \) for this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's puzzle-solving ability and high intelligence could be relevant.
   - However, there is no direct mention of interest in business or administrative activities.
   - His strong appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply broadly, but there is less direct evidence to strongly support a preference for business administration.

   Given these factors, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Adam being in business administration is significantly lower.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here is the tentative frame:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

The probabilities provided are indicative and are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality traits with the fields in question. The higher value for agricultural and veterinary science reflects a stronger alignment with Adam's described interests and characteristics.
