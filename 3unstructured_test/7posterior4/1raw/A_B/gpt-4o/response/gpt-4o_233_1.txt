To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to incorporate both the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the field \( H \) (i.e., \( P(E|H) \)), the prior probability of the field \( P(H) \), and the normalization constant \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the normalization constant \( P(E) \) are not provided, we'll focus on the conditional likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on the information in the personality sketch.

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is reasonably high because Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy align well with the typical attributes of students in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **business administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low, as business administration typically requires a different set of priorities and interests compared to those exhibited by Adam, such as curiosity about nature and plants, and love for animals.

We can only reasonably approximate these probabilities based on the alignment of Adam's characteristics with the typical attributes of each field.

Based on qualitative analysis:
- Let's assume that the base rate \( P(H) \) for both fields is somewhat similar, as we are not provided with specific priors.
- We'll approximate the normalized probability \( P(E) \) such that we're only focusing on the relative ratios rather than exact numbers.

Hence, we can present an educated guess of the posterior probabilities, based on the degree of alignment of Adam's profile with the fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values provide a relative indication that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration, based on the personality sketch provided.
