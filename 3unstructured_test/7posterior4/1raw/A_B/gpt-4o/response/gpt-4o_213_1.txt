To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we will assume some reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch. 

For simplicity, we will perform a qualitative assessment:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Adam loves animals.

   These attributes strongly align with someone studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a specialized field, so the prior probability might be lower compared to more common fields like Business Administration.

   Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (in an arbitrary probability scale).

### Business Administration:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam is a compassionate, warm-hearted person with a strong appreciation for hard work, which might be beneficial in any field, including Business Administration, but it does not strongly align with his specific curiosity about nature and animals.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Business Administration is a common field of study.

   Let's assume \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (in an arbitrary probability scale).

### Simplified Bayesian Reasoning:
Since exact values and detailed prior distributions are not provided, we will rely on qualitative reasoning.

Given the evidence for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is stronger:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag.vet}}) \) > \( P(E|H_{\text{bus.admin}}) \)
- And priors \( P(H_{\text{ag.vet}}) \) are smaller but consistent with stronger evidence.

A qualitative assessment might look like this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This qualitative representation reflects that based on the provided evidence, Adam is more likely to be studying Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.

Note: To provide an exact numerical posterior probability, we would need detailed data on the likelihoods and priors.
