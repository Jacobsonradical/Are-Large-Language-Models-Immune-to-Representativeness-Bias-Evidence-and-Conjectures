To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down, even though we don't have exact numerical values for each component. Instead, I'll provide an interpretive estimate based on the provided personality sketch:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The general likelihood of a graduate student being in each field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is in each specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality traits, across all possible fields.

### Estimates

- **Business Administration**:

  - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: There are typical numbers of students in business administration programs.
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, animals, empathy, and interest in abstract concepts, it seems less likely that he would fit the typical profile of a business administration student.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:

  - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: There are fewer students in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to business administration.
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits, such as his love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, align very well with this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can roughly estimate the posterior probabilities.

### Quantitative Estimation

To be clear, these values are informed estimates since we lack precise numerical values.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits better with the agricultural and veterinary science field.
