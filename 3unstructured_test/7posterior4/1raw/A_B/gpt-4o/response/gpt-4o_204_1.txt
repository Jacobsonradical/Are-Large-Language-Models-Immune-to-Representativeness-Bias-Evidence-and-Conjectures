To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H | E) \) for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, we'll need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have exact numerical probabilities for \( P(E | H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll use qualitative reasoning based on the provided personality sketch \( E \).

For business administration:
- \( P(E | H) \): The personality traits of a strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and appreciation for hard work do not strongly match typical characteristics for someone in business administration. Therefore, \( P(E | H) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, so \( P(H) \) is moderately high.
- \( P(E) \): The evidence describes Adam as someone who loves nature, animals, and is empathetic, which isn't particularly common in business administration. Thus, \( P(E) \) is not high in general for this field.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- \( P(E | H) \): The personality traits match very well with this field. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are all highly relevant. Therefore, \( P(E | H) \) is very high.
- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration but still a significant field. So \( P(H) \) has a moderate value.
- \( P(E) \): Given the strong alignment of traits with this field, \( P(E) \) is high for this hypothesis.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are illustrative and convey the likelihood based on the provided personality sketch \( E \). In a real quantitative situation, we'd need more specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.
