To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \), we will need to make qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch and plausible assumptions.

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, empathy, and high intelligence, we can qualitatively estimate the likelihood of him being enrolled in each of the fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants suggests a high likelihood of him being interested in agricultural sciences.
- His deep love for animals aligns well with veterinary science.
- Both fields demand a high degree of empathy, understanding, and dedication.

### Business Administration
- Adam's personality traits suggest he might not be as likely to pursue a field like business administration, which typically requires a different set of interests and skills, such as a focus on economics, management, and finance.
- While his high intelligence and problem-solving skills could be beneficial in business, his primary interests seem to align more with natural and veterinary sciences.

Considering these qualitative assessments, the probabilities can be expressed as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are approximate and based on the compatibility between Adam's personality traits and the nature of each field.
