To compute posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need certain pre-conditions, such as the prior probabilities, likelihoods, and so forth. Without specific data, we can provide a qualitative reasoning-based answer. Hereâ€™s the simplified approach:

Given:

- **Bayes' Theorem**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
  \]

- **Fields of Study** \( H \):
  - Business Administration
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Personality Sketch \( E \) Includes**:
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
  - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles
  - Warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals
  - High intelligence, good with abstract concepts
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Prior could be uniform since without specific data it can be considered the same for all fields.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Based on Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood can be qualitatively assessed.

### Qualitative Analysis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Curiosity about Nature**: Not significantly related.
   - **Love for Animals and Plants**: Not significantly related.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: Relevant but not specific.
   - **Empathy and Warm Heart**: Possibly relevant for management, albeit less in comparison to Veterinary Science.
   - **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Relevant but common across fields.
   - **Appreciation for Hard Work**: Common trait in all fields.

   Thus, while some traits overlap, many specifics of personality sketch \( E \) are less indicative of business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Curiosity about Nature**: Directly relevant.
   - **Love for Animals and Plants**: Directly relevant.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: Relevant, as scientific fields often require strong problem-solving abilities.
   - **Empathy and Warm Heart**: Directly relevant, critical in Veterinary Science.
   - **Understanding Abstract Concepts**: Also highly relevant, especially in sciences.
   - **Appreciation for Hard Work**: Relevant in scientific research and practice.

   Thus, many traits from \( E \) indicate a strong alignment with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Business Administration (0.2)**: Adam's traits *might* align to some extent with fields requiring problem-solving and empathy, but the core interests (nature, animals) do not strongly align.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Many of Adam's outlined traits (nature, love for animals) align well with this field, making it highly probable that his personality matches someone likely to pursue this field.

These probabilities are illustrative, and without exact priors and likelihood values, they are based on qualitative assessments.
