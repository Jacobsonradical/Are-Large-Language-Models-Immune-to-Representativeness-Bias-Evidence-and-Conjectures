To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, let’s break down the steps. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \), which we can assume to be the proportion of graduate students in the given field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, which ensures that the posterior probabilities sum up to 1 across all hypotheses, but since we don't have all hypotheses, we won't prioritize computing this value.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let’s make some assumptions about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   
   These traits make it very likely that Adam could be in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E | H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration:** 
   - While Adam is empathetic and intelligent, and possibly could be in any field, there is nothing specifically tying his described traits to business administration directly.
   
   Hence, \( P(E | H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Since we don’t have exact numerical priors or likelihoods, we will provide a qualitative estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
