To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we can follow these steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule**: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

2. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
Since we don't have specific prior data, we will assume the prior probabilities are equal for business administration and agricultural and veterinary science. This simplifies the focus to comparing the likelihood of evidence given each hypothesis.

3. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
We need to estimate how likely the personality traits described in E (Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, etc.) are under each field.

**For Business Administration**:
- While intelligence and problem-solving can fit, traits like a deep love for nature, empathy towards animals, and interest in plants are generally less emphasized in this field.

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- Traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and interest in plants are highly relevant and emphasized.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the respective likelihoods.

4. **Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)**:
Given our estimates:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high because the personality traits match well.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is lower because the personality traits are less typical.

Based on these factors, and assuming equal prior probabilities, we can estimate the posterior probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values reflect that it is much more likely that Adam, with his described personality traits, was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration in 2021.
