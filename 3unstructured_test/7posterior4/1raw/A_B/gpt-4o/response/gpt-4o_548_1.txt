To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \), as well as the prior probabilities of each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have explicit numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can make educated estimations based on the provided personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, we can reasonably estimate:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high because his personality traits are a good fit for this field.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) might be higher than some other random fields for someone of his interests.

### Business Administration

While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit business administration, the rest of Adam's personality sketch, such as his empathy, love for nature, and animals, seems less aligned with business administration. Hence:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science, given the mismatch between his personality traits and typical characteristics required for this field.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) could be considered lower than agricultural and veterinary science for a person with his interests and traits.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can estimate the posterior probabilities in relative terms:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

Note that these values are based on qualitative reasoning and could vary if we had concrete data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
