To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some assumptions and evaluations. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, without specific data on \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam and common trends in graduate field enrollments.

Let’s assume:
1. \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is relatively high since Adam shows strong interest in plants, nature, love for animals, and empathy.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low since Adam’s personality does not align well with the typical traits of business administration students like strong interest in finance, management, and less emphasis on nature and animals.

For simplicity, I’ll assume:
1. A relatively high prior probability \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., 0.06, assuming 6% of students are in this field).
2. A relatively high prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration (e.g., 0.15, assuming 15% of students are in this field).
3. \( P(E) \) is normalized.

Assuming high alignment of interests:
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we can plug these into Bayes’ rule:

1. For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.06}{P(E)}
\]

2. For business administration:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)}
\]

Considering \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant for multiple fields and they need not sum to 1 here, we can output the posterior probabilities proportionately. Let’s denote these as relative posterior probabilities.

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.06}{normalized}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{normalized}
\]

Normalizing the constants for a rough comparison:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.048}{normalized} \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{normalized} \)

Here is the relative posterior probability considering normalization:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.048",
  "business administration": "0.03"
}

To convert these into conditional probabilities, we must ensure they respect a valid proportional comparison:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.048 / (0.048 + 0.03) ≈ 0.615",
  "business administration": "0.03 / (0.048 + 0.03) ≈ 0.385"
}

Translating these to a normalized format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.615",
  "business administration": "0.385"
}

Given the subjective nature and assumptions, these numerical values are illustrative approximations.
