To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of observing his personality traits given those fields. However, without specific numerical data for priors and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Here, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) represents how probable Adam's personality traits are if he were enrolled in the respective field. While the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can be disregarded for relative comparison purposes, the priors \( P(H) \) would generally reflect the proportion of graduate students in each field.

Let's analyze qualitatively:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Generally a popular graduate field.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less directly aligned with typical business administration programs, which may focus more on managerial, financial, and organizational skills.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Likely less common than business administration.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High likelihood since this field involves a strong understanding and appreciation for nature, animals, and the hard work and dedication associated with these careers.

Given these qualitative assessments, Adam's personality traits suggest a stronger alignment with agricultural and veterinary science, despite lower prior enrollment probabilities in this field.

Thus, the computed posterior probabilities will qualitatively reflect much higher values for agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These values reflect that Adam is far more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on his personality traits.
