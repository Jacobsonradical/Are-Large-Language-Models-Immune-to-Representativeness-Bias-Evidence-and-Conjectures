To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \). 

Since we lack specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, we'll make educated estimates based on the provided personality sketch and the general characteristics of the fields in question. Essentially, we need to qualitatively determine how well the evidence matches each hypothesis.

For Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, loves animals.
- He has a high intelligence and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work.

Given this profile, let's evaluate the fields:

### Business Administration
- Business Administration typically involves managing businesses, administration, finance, human resources, marketing, etc.
- It may not strongly align with Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals. It also might not fully utilize his curiosity about nature or appreciation for plants.
- His personality traits like empathy and puzzle-solving might be positive but not definitive traits for someone in Business Administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- This field directly involves working with plants and animals, aligning strongly with Adam’s love for nature and animals.
- The subject's empathy and appreciation for hard work are crucial traits in this field.
- His curiosity about nature and plants fits perfectly here.

Without specific numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we'll assign qualitative estimates:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, because his profile doesn't align closely with the typical qualities needed.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Moderate, since many students enroll in business.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, due to strong alignment with his attributes.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Lower than business administration but still respectable enrollment figures.

Now, let's provide a realistic estimated range between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are approximate and based on qualitative matching of the personality traits described to the fields in question.
