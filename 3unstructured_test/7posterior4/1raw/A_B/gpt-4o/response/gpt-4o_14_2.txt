To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall evidence \( P(E) \), we can only provide a qualitative analysis based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work (which aligns well with the themes of agricultural science and veterinary science), it is reasonable to consider that \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is relatively high. Conversely, these traits fit less well with business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively lower.

Approximating qualitatively (since we lack exact probabilities), we could estimate as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being in a field aligned with his interests and personality traits, given the personality sketch provided.
