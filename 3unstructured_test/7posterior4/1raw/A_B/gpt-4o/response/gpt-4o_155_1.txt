To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \) under all hypotheses.

However, without specific numerical data for these probabilities, we need to make educated estimations based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Business Administration \( (H_1) \):**
   - \( P(E|H_1) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits someone in business administration seems relatively low. Business students tend to be more interested in commerce, leadership, and organizational skills rather than nature, plants, or animals. This value might be around 0.1.
   - \( P(H_1) \): Business administration is one of the popular fields, but not overwhelmingly common among all graduate fields. This value might be around 0.2.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( (H_2) \):**
   - \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood that Adam’s personality sketch fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high given his interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy. This value might be around 0.9.
   - \( P(H_2) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common compared to business administration but fits Adam's description much better. This value might be around 0.05.

For simplicity in this qualitative estimation, we assume \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses since it is common evidence \( E \).

Using Bayes' rule heuristically:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx 0.9 \times 0.05 \]

Now, we normalize these values for better comparison:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.05} \approx 0.308 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.1 \times 0.2 + 0.9 \times 0.05} \approx 0.692 \]

Providing the final answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.308,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.692
}
```

These values represent the posterior probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each respective field given his personality sketch.
