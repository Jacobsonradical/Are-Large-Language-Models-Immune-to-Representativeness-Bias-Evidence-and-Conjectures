To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of each hypothesis, \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equal for the sake of this calculation, as no specific priors are provided. This simplifies \( P(E) \), allowing us to focus on the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, empathetic, and loves animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We can infer the likelihood of this profile matching each field.

### Likelihood Analysis

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Business Administration typically involves subjects like management, finance, strategic planning, etc. While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work fit, his love for nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles are less relevant.
     - Lower likelihood: Since Adam's traits aren't strongly aligned with Business Administration characteristics.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: This field heavily involves nature, plants, animals, and requires empathy and dedication, aligning perfectly with Adam's curiosity and interests.
     - Higher likelihood: Adamâ€™s profile fits well with the typical attributes and interests needed in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)

By normalizing these values under the assumption of equal priors, the posterior probabilities become proportional to the likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": \( \approx \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.8} = \frac{0.2}{1.0} = 0.2 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \approx \frac{0.8}{0.2 + 0.8} = \frac{0.8}{1.0} = 0.8 \)
}
