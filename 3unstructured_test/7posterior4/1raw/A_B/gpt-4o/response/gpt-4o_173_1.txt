To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Define Bayes' rule**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Determine the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.

3. **Determine the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability of the hypothesis before observing the evidence.

4. **Calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of observing the evidence, obtained by summing over all possible hypotheses.

Since we lack specific statistical data for priors and likelihoods, assumptions must be made based on common knowledge and logical inferences from the personality sketch provided.

Let's go through this for each hypothesis.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's highly probable that his personality aligns well with this field.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively common field for those interested in animals and nature. 
- **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The evidence \(E\) is attributed to various potential fields, not just agricultural and veterinary science.

### For Business Administration
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the personality traits, Adam doesn't seem to fit the typical business administration profile. His love for nature, animals, and empathy may not align well with the primary focus areas of business administration.
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a common field, but the given traits are less indicative of a fit for this field.
- **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: Same as above.

To express these considerations quantitatively:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8, \\
  "business administration": 0.2
}
\]
