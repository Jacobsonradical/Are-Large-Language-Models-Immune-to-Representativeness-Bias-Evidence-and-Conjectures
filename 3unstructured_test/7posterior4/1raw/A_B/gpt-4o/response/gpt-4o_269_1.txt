  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

Here's a brief explanation of the values:

The field of agricultural and veterinary science aligns closely with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and his deep love for animals. His strong empathy and understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also suggest that he would likely thrive in a field that involves the care and study of living organisms.

On the other hand, business administration doesn't closely align with Adam's interests and personality traits described in the sketch. While business administration requires intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, it typically does not focus on nature, animals, or puzzles in the same way that agricultural and veterinary sciences do.

Thus, the posterior probabilities reflect a higher likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
