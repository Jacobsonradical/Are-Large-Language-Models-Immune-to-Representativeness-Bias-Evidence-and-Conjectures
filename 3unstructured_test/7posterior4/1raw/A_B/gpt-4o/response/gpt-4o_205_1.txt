To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on Bayes' rule, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a simplified estimation, we'll make some qualitative assumptions about the likelihoods and prior probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch. 

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how likely Adam's characteristics are given that he is in a specific field.
2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the general probability of a student enrolling in that field.

Let's simplify the assumptions:

- Adam's characteristics (empathy, love for animals, curiosity about plants) suggest a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration does not align well with the described traits.

Let's qualitatively estimate the likelihood for each field based on the description:

- \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \) is high, approximately 0.9.
- \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \) is low, approximately 0.2.

Assuming for simplicity that each field has the same prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \) where \( N \) is the total number of graduate fields (which we can consider as a large even distribution for simplicity), Bayes' rule simplifies into relatively comparing likelihoods:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 / (0.9 + 0.2) ≈ 0.818,
  "business administration": 0.2 / (0.9 + 0.2) ≈ 0.182 
}

Thus, the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) can be approximately given as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
```

This result indicates that based on Adam's personality sketch, it's much more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
