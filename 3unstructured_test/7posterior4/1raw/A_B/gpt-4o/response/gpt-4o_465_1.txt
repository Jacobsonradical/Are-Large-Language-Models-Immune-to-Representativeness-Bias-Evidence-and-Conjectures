To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) or likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)) given in the problem statement. Without specific data, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions

1. **Personality Sketch E:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
   - Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

2. **Relevant Fields and Hypotheses:**
   - **Business administration**: Typically involves subjects like management, finance, and marketing. Less alignment with Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature.
   - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Directly involves nature, plants, and animals. Strong alignment with Adam's curiosity, empathy, and love for animals.

Given Adam's described characteristics, he fits better within the field of agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. Therefore, we can assume that:

- \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) > P(E|H_{\text{business}})\)
  
3. **Informed Guess:**
   - Since we have higher relevance for agricultural and veterinary science, we will assign higher probability values for it than for business administration.

### Computations

Since exact values are not provided, these are hypothetical but educated estimates:

- For **business administration**:
  - \(P(E|H_{\text{business}})\) is relatively low.
  - Prior \(P(H_{\text{business}})\) can be considered average, given it's a common field.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}})\) is relatively high.
  - Prior \(P(H_{\text{agricultural}})\) can be moderately high, considering it's a less common but highly relevant field for Adam's characteristics.

### Posterior Probabilities

Using our educated guesses:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,  // relatively low due to the mismatch in interests
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7  // higher due to a strong match with Adam's personality
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood based on the personality sketch of Adam, assigning a higher probability to agricultural and veterinary science, where his interests and characteristics seem to align closely.
