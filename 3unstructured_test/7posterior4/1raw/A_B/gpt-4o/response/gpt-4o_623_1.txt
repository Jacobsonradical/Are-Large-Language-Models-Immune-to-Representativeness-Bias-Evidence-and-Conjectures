To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probability \( P(H) \). While exact numerical values for these probabilities usually require specific datasets, I'll provide a qualitative estimation based on the description.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of Adam's personality sketch occurring.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), let's provide a qualitative analysis:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Business administration might involve teamwork, leadership, and people skills, which don't strongly align with Adam's preferences for quiet activities, empathy for animals, and curiosity about nature. So, the likelihood is low.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, so the prior probability might be moderate.
   - Posterior \( P(H|E) \): Combining the low likelihood with a moderate prior will yield a relatively low posterior probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals strongly align with this field, so the likelihood is high.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than some fields like business administration, so the prior probability might be lower but still notable.
   - Posterior \( P(H|E) \): The high likelihood coupled with a moderate prior will yield a relatively high posterior probability.

Given this qualitative analysis and for the purposes of providing a relative estimation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the greater alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The probability values are illustrative and based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise numerical calculation.
