To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (the probability of \( H \) before seeing the evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \) (the total probability of observing \( E \) under all possible hypotheses).

### Assumptions and Likelihood Estimations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) depends on the proportion of students enrolling in agricultural and veterinary sciences, which can vary. Let's assume it's relatively moderate.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Considering Adam's interests and personality traits, it's less likely that his deep love for animals and nature translates into business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is lower.
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration is also contingent on the proportion of students selecting this field, which is generally higher than for more specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these factors, assigning specific numerical values to these probabilities will require some judgment. Since specific prior data isn't provided, we'll assume typical distributions:

- Let's suppose \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.15 \) for agricultural and veterinary science.
- And \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.25 \) for business administration.

For likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \) due to the alignment of Adam's traits.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \) due to weaker alignment.

The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) can be represented as a normalizing constant but doesn't need strict calculation since these are comparative probabilities:

### Calculations:

Using Bayes' rule for each field:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, though these probabilities are relative and not absolute.
