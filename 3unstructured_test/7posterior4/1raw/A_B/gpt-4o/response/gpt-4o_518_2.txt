To compute posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given each hypothesis H. Since we don't have exact values, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): The posterior probability of hypothesis H given the evidence E (Adam's personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of E, which is the total probability of observing E across all possible hypotheses.

Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume that in the universe of graduate students, there are more students in business administration than in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let’s assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.3 \) and \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam’s traits are more aligned with an interest in agriculture, animals, nature, and empathy, which are more likely in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.05 \) (as empathy and love for animals is less common in business).
   - Assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.7 \) (as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field).

3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is harder to calculate exactly but can be approximated using the law of total probability.
   - \( P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.05 \cdot 0.3 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.015 + 0.07 = 0.085 \)

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

- For business administration:
  \[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.3}{0.085} \approx 0.176 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.085} \approx 0.824 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.176,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.824
}
