In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need more specific numerical data, including prior probabilities and the likelihood of observing the personality traits given each field of enrollment. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.

These traits align more closely with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science.

On the other hand:
- There's no information suggesting business inclination, interests, or skills specific to business administration.

So, qualitatively we can assume the posterior probabilities favor agricultural and veterinary sciences over business administration. Without numerical data, I will provide an educated guess within a reasonable range based on the provided sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities are subjective estimations reflecting the fit of Adam's personality to each field.
