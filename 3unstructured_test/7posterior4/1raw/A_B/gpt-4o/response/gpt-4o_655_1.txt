To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider not only the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits in each field but also the prior probabilities of him being in those fields. However, without specific prior data or other observational data, we'll need to make educated guesses based on typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence or the total probability of E.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can qualitatively assess:

1. **Business administration**: While it is possible for someone in business administration to have these traits, they are perhaps not typical. Business administration students may have some empathy and intelligence, but curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and enjoyment of puzzles might not be as common.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam’s traits such as a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and curiosity about nature align closely with this field. These characteristics are usually prevalent among students in this field.

Thus, we estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \) to be relatively low.
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \) to be much higher.

Assuming that prior probabilities \( P(H_{business\ administration}) \) and \( P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \) are somewhat similar (though this may depend on the university population which isn't specified) and \( P(E) \) is the same for comparison. This leads us to qualitatively differentiate based on \( P(E|H) \).

Thus, the rough qualitative estimates for conditional probabilities would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values, while not precise, indicate a much stronger alignment of Adam’s characteristics with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration based on the given personality sketch.
