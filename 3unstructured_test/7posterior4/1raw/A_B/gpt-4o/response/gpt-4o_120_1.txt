Bayes' rule allows us to compute the posterior probability \[P(H|E)\] using the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Given the sketch, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of Adam's characteristics fitting each of the specified fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in business administration. Business typically attracts individuals interested in leadership, economics, marketing, etc., which doesn't strongly align with Adam's love for nature, empathy, and deep love for animals. Therefore, we might assign a low probability.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of any graduate student being in business administration. This field is quite common, so this might have a moderate value.
   - **P(E)**: The marginal probability of observing Adam's characteristics among all graduate students. This is a typical probability based on the overall mix of all fields, which we'll assume to be constant for normalization.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's characteristics given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. This field aligns very well with Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals. Thus, we would assign a high probability.
   - **P(H)**: The prior probability of any graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than business but still significant. We might assign a moderate to low value here.
   - **P(E)**: As above, this remains constant for normalization.

Given the general alignment:
- **P(E|H)** for agricultural and veterinary science is substantially higher.
- **P(H)** for business administration is moderate but lower for agricultural and veterinary science.

Assuming proportional relationships:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_{\text{business}}) & \approx 0.1 \\
P(H_{\text{business}}) & \approx 0.2 
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) & \approx 0.8 \\
P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) & \approx 0.05
\end{align*}
\]

Without the exact \(P(E)\), we are presenting normalized values between 0 and 1:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx 0.02 \div P(E) \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \approx 0.04 \div P(E) \)
}

Thus, roughly,

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}

Given these approximations are relative:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Conclusively, we have:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
