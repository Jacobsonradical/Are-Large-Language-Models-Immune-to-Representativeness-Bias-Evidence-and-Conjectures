To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we don't have specific data for the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in the personality sketch \( E \).

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume some generic prior probability distribution for a graduate student being in different fields:
   - Business administration has a prior probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)
   - Agricultural and veterinary science has a prior probability \( P(H_{AV}) \)
   
   Assuming there are numerous graduate fields, let's consider the priors to be:
   - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.10 \)

   These are arbitrary but reasonable values given many fields of study.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   The personality sketch suggests a fit for agricultural and veterinary science over business administration.
   - For business administration: Considering Adam's traits, being high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts might be a fit, but his strong love for animals and nature is less relevant. We might rate this likelihood low.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's traits align closely. His curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work are directly relevant.

   Let's assume the likelihoods as follows:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.8 \)

### Calculating \( P(H|E) \):
Using Bayes' rule:

1. For **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, the exact value is not necessary for comparing relative probabilities. Thus:
   \[
   P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03
   \]

2. For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)}
   \]
   Similarly,
   \[
   P(H_{AV}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
   \]

We now have unnormalized probabilities:
- Business Administration: 0.03
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.08

### Normalizing:
To get the normalized values, we would calculate:
- Sum = \( 0.03 + 0.08 = 0.11 \)
- Normalized \( P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.27 \)
- Normalized \( P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.73 \)

Converting these to a format, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73
}
```

These values reflect the relative probabilities based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch.
