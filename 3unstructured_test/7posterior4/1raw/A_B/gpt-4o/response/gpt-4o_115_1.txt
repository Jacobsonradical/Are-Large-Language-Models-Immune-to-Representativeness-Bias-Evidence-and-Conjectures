To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the formula:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods given in the problem, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided for Adam.

Let's denote:
- \(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} = H_1\)
- \(\text{business administration} = H_2\)

Based on Adam's interests and personality:
- High likelihood he might be in a field related to nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
- Lower likelihood he might be in a field that typically emphasizes corporate structure, finance, or economics unless it has a significant relation to his interests.

Assuming:
- \( P(H_1) \) (prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science) is moderately high.
- \( P(H_2) \) (prior probability of being in business administration) is lower, as it aligns less with his interests and personality traits.
- \( P(E | H_1) \) (likelihood of personality traits in agricultural and veterinary science) is high.
- \( P(E | H_2) \) (likelihood of personality traits in business administration) is lower.

If we make approximate qualitative guesses considering Adam's inclination towards nature and empathy, we could give rough probability values for these fields.

Here is the hypothesized posterior probability considering the sketch:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8, 
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that without specific numerical priors and likelihoods, these values are educated estimates based on qualitative information from the personality sketch.
