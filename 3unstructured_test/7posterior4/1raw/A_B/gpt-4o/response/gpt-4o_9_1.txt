To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need several pieces of information:
- The prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each respective field, denoted \( P(H_{\text{field}}) \).
- The likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field, denoted \( P(E|H_{\text{field}}) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) remains constant while comparing the probabilities for different hypotheses, allowing us to focus on the numerator.

For simplicity, we'll assume equal priors for each field (e.g., \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = P(H_{\text{vet_science}}) \)) and focus on the likelihoods.

### Assumption on Likelihoods

Given the personality sketch \( E \):
- High curiosity about nature and plants favors agricultural and veterinary fields more than business.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, and high intelligence could be relevant across multiple fields.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals strongly favor veterinary science.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication could apply across fields but often noted in rigorous science fields.

For simplicity, let's hypothesize the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) is low because the characteristics don't strongly align with typical business administration traits.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \) is moderate to high due to the interest in nature and plants.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{veterinary}}) \) is high due to the love for animals and empathy.

### Calculated Values

Let's assign subjective numerical values for these likelihoods for an illustrative example:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{veterinary}}) = 0.8 \)

Using equal priors, this gives us:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = P(H_{\text{veterinary}}) = \frac{1}{\text{number of fields under consideration}} \]

Assuming 3 main fields here:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = P(H_{\text{vet_science}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

We can now calculate the unnormalized posterior probabilities.

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.1}{3} = 0.033\bar{3} \]

For agricultural science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}})P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.6 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.6}{3} = 0.2 \]

For veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{vet_science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{vet_science}})P(H_{\text{vet_science}}) = 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.8}{3} = 0.266\bar{6} \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are roughly as follows illustrated:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467
}
```

Please note that in a full Bayesian analysis, we would normalize these probabilities by dividing by the sum of all numerator terms for a meaningful comparison within a specific choice set. Also, these probabilities are illustrative and subjective given the limited data and context provided.
