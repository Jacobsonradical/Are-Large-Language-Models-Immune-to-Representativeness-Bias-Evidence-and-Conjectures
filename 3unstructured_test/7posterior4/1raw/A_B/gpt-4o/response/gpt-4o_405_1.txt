To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several elements such as the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Given that full statistical data is not provided, we will make reasoned assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For both fields:

### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   \[ P(H_{business}) \] is relatively high since business administration is a common graduate field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student. It is less likely that such individuals, with strong inclinations towards nature and animals, would predominantly be in business administration.

3. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   Given the mismatch between Adam's characteristics and the typical traits of business administration students, the posterior probability would be low.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   \[ P(H_{agricultural}) \] is generally lower compared to business administration as fewer students typically enroll in this field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam’s characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) align well with traits commonly found in students of agricultural and veterinary science. The likelihood is high for this match.

3. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**:
   Given the strong alignment with Adam’s characteristics, the posterior probability \( P(H_{agricultural}|E) \) would be higher.

Let’s give some plausible numerical values to express these probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are based on the strong alignment of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
