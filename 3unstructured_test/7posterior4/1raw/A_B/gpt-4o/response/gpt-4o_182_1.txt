To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a particular field.
3. **Overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are asked to provide values between 0 and 1 without actual data, we will provide educated guesses based on the personality sketch. 

### Business Administration:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the priors for business administration to be lower than for agricultural and veterinary science due to personality traits aligned more with the latter.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The evidence (personality sketch) is less likely to be associated with a business administration student, who might typically have more interest in management, finance, and less focus on empathy and nature.

3. **Overall Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the same for both fields and will cancel out in a relative comparison.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Higher prior assuming that Adam's traits are more typical for a student in this field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The evidence aligns well with traits commonly associated with agricultural and veterinary science students, such as a love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work.

Let's denote arbitrary values for priors and likelihoods relative to one another:

- Let \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \) and \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Let \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \approx 0.8 \) and \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \approx 0.3 \)

By Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both calculations, let's focus on the numerical comparisons:

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \approx 0.24 \]

Therefore,

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24
}
```

Keep in mind these values are illustrative and based on assumptions due to lack of specific empirical data.
