To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to recall the formula: 

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

However, without concrete data on the priors and the likelihoods, we can only make a reasoned estimation based on the qualitative information provided.

### Estimations:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having a personality sketch \( E \) given he is enrolled in Business Administration might be low. Business Administration typically attracts people who are outgoing, leadership-oriented, and perhaps more interested in human constructs (like markets, organizations) than nature.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be moderate, as Business Administration is a common field.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having a personality sketch \( E \) given he is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high. This field correlates well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be lower than Business Administration, as it is a less common field.

Based on these qualitative evaluations, we can reason the following:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
\]

These numbers are illustrative and rely on qualitative assessment, not on actual statistical data.
