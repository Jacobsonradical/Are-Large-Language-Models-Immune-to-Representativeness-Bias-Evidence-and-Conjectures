To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities for each field and the likelihood of the evidence given those fields. However, given the information, this analysis will be more qualitative and based on subjective estimation. Without specific numerical priors and likelihoods, we will consider the fit between Adam's characteristics and the typical attributes associated with students in each field.

Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume \( P(E) \) remains constant for comparison purposes and focus on how well Adam's personality sketch \( E \) fits with each hypothesis \( H \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically, students in this field might be more oriented toward commerce, management, leadership, and organization.
   - Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and focus on hard work and dedication do not strongly align with the typical traits emphasized in business administration.
   - Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field highly values an understanding of nature, animals, and dedication, strongly aligning with Adam's traits.
   - Adam's deep love for animals, interest in nature and plants, and strong empathy suggest he would fit well into this field.
   - Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Note that these values are subjective and based on a qualitative match of Adam's personality sketch with the typical attributes of each field. Further data would be required for precise calculations.
