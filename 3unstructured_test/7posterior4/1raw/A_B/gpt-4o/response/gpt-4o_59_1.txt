To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the two fields of study, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we do not have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we have to estimate these values based on the given personality sketch \( E \) of Adam.

For "business administration," the pertinent traits from \( E \) are high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals do not strongly align with typical traits for someone in business administration.

For "agricultural and veterinary science," the traits such as genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align very well.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \), as his personality seems less aligned with business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \), as his personality fits well with this field.

If we assume that \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) are equal as a baseline (since we do not have specific data on their prior proportions), we get:

\[ P(H|E) = P(E|H) \] 

Thus:
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
