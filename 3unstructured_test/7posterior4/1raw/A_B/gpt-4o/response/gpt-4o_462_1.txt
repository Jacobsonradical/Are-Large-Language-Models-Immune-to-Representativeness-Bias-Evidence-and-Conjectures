To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider multiple factors, such as prior probabilities of each field, the likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given his field of study, and normalization constants. Since we do not have specific data, the calculation involves subjective assessment. However, I'll provide a reasoned estimate based on the available information.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's marginal likelihood.

For this case, let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the personality sketch, we assign higher \( P(E|H) \) values for fields that align better with Adam's traits.

### Assessment:
- **Business Administration**: Fields of business administration generally require interest in management, finance, and people skills less specific to nature, animals, empathy, or puzzles. The personality sketch does not strongly indicate these typical traits.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and intelligence in solving abstract concepts. The likelihood of observing his traits given this hypothesis seems higher.

### Prior Probabilities:
Assuming no specific prior data and using intuition:
- \( P(H_1) \approx 0.15 \) (lower, as fewer graduates might fit the described traits directly).
- \( P(H_2) \approx 0.25 \) (higher, given the alignment).

### Likelihood Estimates:
- \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.05 \) (traits poorly aligned with a typical Business Administration student).
- \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.7 \) (traits well aligned with Agricultural and Veterinary Science).

### Normalization:
Since we lack precise \( P(E) \), we infer relative probabilities rather than normalizing fully.

### Posterior Calculation:
- For Business Administration (\( H_1 \)):
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1)P(H_1) = 0.05 \times 0.15 = 0.0075 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_2 \)):
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2)P(H_2) = 0.7 \times 0.25 = 0.175 \]

Converting these to normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.0075}{0.0075 + 0.175} = \frac{0.0075}{0.1825} \approx 0.0411 \]

\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.175}{0.0075 + 0.175} = \frac{0.175}{0.1825} \approx 0.9589 \]

Thus, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0411,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9589
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality traits, he is far more likely to have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration as a graduate student in 2021.
