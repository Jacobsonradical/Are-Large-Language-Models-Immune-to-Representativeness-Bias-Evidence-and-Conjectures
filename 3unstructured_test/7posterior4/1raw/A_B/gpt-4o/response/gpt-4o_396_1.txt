To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration" given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have detailed numerical values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided and use these to informally estimate the probabilities.

**Assessing \( P(E|H) \):**
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The subject enjoys nature, plants, and animals, which are directly aligned with this field. The subject's empathy and intelligence also fit well with veterinary science aspects.
   - Relative estimate: High.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The subject's traits (curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals) do not directly correlate with business administration. While solving puzzles could be somewhat relevant, it is less likely compared to the fit with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Relative estimate: Low.

**Assessing Prior \( P(H) \):**
- Assume some reasonable priors based on the commonality of the fields:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Moderate.
  - Business Administration: Common.

Given these assessments, we can suggest that the posterior probability is relatively higher for agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

Here's the qualitative estimate for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

Please note that these values are rough estimates based on qualitative reasoning from the personality sketch and common expectations about graduate fields. Accurate numerical computation would require actual data on priors, likelihoods, and marginals.
