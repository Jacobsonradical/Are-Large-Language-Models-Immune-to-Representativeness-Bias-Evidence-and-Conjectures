Let's compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can perform a qualitative assessment, suggesting relative probabilities based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

Given Adam's personality sketch:

- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a love for animals.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, and appreciates hard work.

These traits suggest a higher likelihood of being involved in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. Since solving puzzles and abstract thinking could be found in many fields, but his love for nature, plants, and animals are stronger indicators for agricultural and veterinary science than for business administration.

Without specific numeric values for prior and likelihood probabilities, we make a qualitative judgment to estimate relative probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

This assumes that Adam's traits significantly align with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. The actual numerical values could be refined with further data on the probability distributions of these traits within the fields of study.
