To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow this formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), or \(P(E)\), I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of graduate students in those fields.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H):**
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** This depends on how many graduate students typically enroll in this field. For this analysis, we assume it is not an uncommon field but also not the most populous like business administration.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** Based on E, Adam has a strong appreciation for nature, plants, animals, and hard work. These traits are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration (H):**
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\):** Business administration is a widely popular graduate field, so \(P(H)\) could be higher.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):** Adam's interests in nature, plants, puzzles, and empathy are not directly aligned with business administration. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) might be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the qualitative nature of this assessment, I'll infer approximate probabilities reflecting the compatibility between Adam's personality and each field.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

### Explanation of the Values:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.85):** Adam's traits strongly correlate with this field, making it highly likely.
- **Business Administration (0.15):** While not impossible, Adam's personality sketch does not strongly suggest a fit for business administration.

Notice these values are qualitative and based on personality fit, not exact figures, and are inherently subjective.
