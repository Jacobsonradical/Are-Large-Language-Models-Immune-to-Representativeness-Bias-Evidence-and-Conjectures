To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field and \( E \) is the personality sketch provided, we use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we lack concrete prior probability values and the probability of evidence \(P(E)\), we can consider the traits in the personality sketch and qualitatively assess \(P(E|H)\) for each field. This can give us relative probabilities rather than exact numerical values.

Letâ€™s break this down for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, empathy, love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, the match with agricultural and veterinary science is high. Therefore, \(P(E|H_{agriculture \& veterinary science})\) is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration:**

Although high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts apply, Adam's personality sketch heavily emphasizes traits related to nature, animals, empathy, and hard work, which may not be as directly aligned with business administration. Therefore, \(P(E|H_{business administration})\) would be relatively lower.

For the purposes of providing relative probabilities, we can estimate based on qualitative reasoning:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}

Please note, these values are qualitative estimates rather than precise calculations as concrete data for prior probabilities and probability distributions for the evidence were not provided.
