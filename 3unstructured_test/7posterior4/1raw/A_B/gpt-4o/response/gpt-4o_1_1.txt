To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd ideally need the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \) and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). However, given the problem's setup, we'll make reasoned estimates based on his characteristics.

Here's Bayes' rule for reference:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have concrete values for priors and likelihoods, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate. This field is not as commonly chosen as business administration but is still significant.
  
2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low. Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and love for animals do not fit well with the typical traits of a business administration student.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): High. Business administration is a commonly chosen field among graduate students.

Let's assign rough estimates:
- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Assuming \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \), \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \), and a simplified estimate for \( P(E) \).
- For **Business Administration**: Assuming \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \), \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \), and the same \( P(E) \).

We don't need the exact value of \( P(E) \) since it would cancel out in the comparison. We'll use these assumptions to derive relative probabilities.

Given these assumptions:
\[ P(Agricultural \; and \; Veterinary\; Science|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(Business \; Administration|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

We know \( P(E) \) is a common factor, so we can compare the numerators:
For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \)
For Business Administration: \( 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \)

The resulting probabilities (normalized to give a sense of relative likelihood) would be:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(Agricultural \; and \; Veterinary\; Science|E) &\approx \frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.03} \approx 0.84 \\
P(Business \; Administration|E) &\approx \frac{0.03}{0.16 + 0.03} \approx 0.16
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.84,
  "business administration": 0.16
}
```
