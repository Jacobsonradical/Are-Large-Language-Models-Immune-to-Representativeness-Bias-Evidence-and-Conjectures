To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to recognize that Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only provide qualitative estimates, not precise numerical values.

The personality sketch of Adam (E) suggests he is empathetic, loves nature and animals, understands abstract concepts, and appreciates hard work and dedication. These traits align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. Therefore, we can qualitatively assign higher posterior probabilities for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's a qualitative, speculative output:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are illustrative, reflecting an informed guess based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical demands and nature of these fields of study. Without actual data for prior and likelihood probabilities, precise calculations aren't feasible.
