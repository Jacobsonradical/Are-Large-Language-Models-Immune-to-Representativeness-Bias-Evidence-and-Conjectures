To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence E.

In this case, let us evaluate the probabilities qualitatively given the personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy fits well with this field. This likelihood would be high.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability could be considered moderate because agricultural and veterinary sciences are specialized but common amongst those with interest in nature and animals.
   - \( P(E) \): This is the normalization constant.

2. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits like empathy and love for animals don't strongly align with business administration. This likelihood would be low.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be higher due to the general popularity of business degrees, but given the specific personality traits described, it seems less likely.
   - \( P(E) \): This is the normalization constant.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some qualitative probabilities and compute the posterior probabilities. For simplicity, let's assume equal prior probabilities initially for each field, given we have no specific prior information.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood)
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (prior moderate)

For Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood)
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (prior moderate)

Let's normalize considering only these two fields:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1}) + P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

\[
P(H_{1}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{1}) \cdot P(H_{1})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

\[
P(H_{2}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{2}) \cdot P(H_{2})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2
\]

Thus, the final probabilities are:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
\]
