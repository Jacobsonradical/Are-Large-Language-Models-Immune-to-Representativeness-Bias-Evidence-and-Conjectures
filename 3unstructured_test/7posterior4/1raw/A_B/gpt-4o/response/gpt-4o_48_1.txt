To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we'll need more precise values for prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the evidence. However, without specific numerical values, I can offer a qualitative assessment.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For each field:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Let's consider qualitative aspects:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, a strong love for animals, and empathy. These traits seem less specific to business administration.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field but given Adamâ€™s interests, it might have a relatively lower prior.
  
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's characteristics (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, appreciation for dedication) strongly align with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H) \): It's less common than business administration but a higher fit given his interests and personality sketch.

Leveraging qualitative judgment and assuming all other fields not listed are equally plausible, here are the qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam's profile aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.
