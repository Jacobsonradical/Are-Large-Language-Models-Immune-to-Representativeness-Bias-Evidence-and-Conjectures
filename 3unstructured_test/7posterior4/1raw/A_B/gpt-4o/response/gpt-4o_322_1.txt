To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihood P(E|H). Because we don't have numerical values for these, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge.

For business administration:
- P(E|H): Adam's personality sketch doesn't align strongly with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student, as it lacks focus on business acumen, leadership, and market-oriented skills.
- P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration could be considered moderately common.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- P(E|H): Adamâ€™s sketch aligns strongly with this field. His love for animals, understanding of nature, and appreciation for hard work are typical traits for someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- P(H): The prior probability of a graduate student being in this field might be lower compared to business administration due to fewer students selecting it, but we'll focus on the alignment of his interests and personality.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Given that P(E) is the same for both hypotheses, and assuming relative strengths of prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can qualitatively understand that the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is higher.

Assumed values:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2\)
- \(P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2\)

- \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8\)
- \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1\)

Then:
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \times P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \times P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]

Normalizing these to sum to 1 (for simplicity, we don't need the exact numbers but relative ratios):
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.04 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.12} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

However, given that there are other fields and these are not exhaustive probabilities, we scale down considering a less than absolute certainty.

Final values:
\[
\{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
\}
\]
