In order to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(E|H) \) – the probability of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \) – the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \) – the marginal probability of observing the personality traits \( E \).

Let's denote the fields as:
- \( H_{\text{business}} \) for business administration
- \( H_{\text{agriculture\_veterinary}} \) for agricultural and veterinary science

Given the personality sketch of Adam, it's intuitive to assign higher values to \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\_veterinary}}) \) due to his love for nature and animals. We can assume some reasonable values based on Adam's described traits.

Estimating some probabilities:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) is relatively low because the traits mentioned (love for nature and animals) are less commonly associated with business administration students.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\_veterinary}}) \) is relatively high as his personality aligns well with this field.

Since we don't have prior specific data, we might assume equal priors for simplicity, i.e., \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \approx P(H_{\text{agriculture\_veterinary}}) \).

For marginal probability, \( P(E) \), we can consider it as a normalizing constant.

Given these considerations, although we don't have exact numerical data, we can provide reasonable probability values based on the subjective likelihood of Adam fitting into each category:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These values suggest that Adam's personality traits make it significantly more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
