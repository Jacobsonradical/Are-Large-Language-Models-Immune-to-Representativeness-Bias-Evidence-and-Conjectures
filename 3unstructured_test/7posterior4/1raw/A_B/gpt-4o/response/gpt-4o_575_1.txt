To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being in a specific field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits given the hypothesis that he is in a specific field.
3. **Normalization Factor \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of Adam having the personality traits across all possible fields. This is generally used to normalize the probabilities but isn't necessary for comparing two specific fields.

Bayes' Rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### 1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**

To simplify, assume \( P(H) \) for each field is roughly equal due to lack of specific prior data (e.g., \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for both fields).

### 2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**

Estimate \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adamâ€™s traits fit into the characteristics typically associated with each field. Given Adam's personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
  - Deep love for animals.
  - Traits strongly align with AVS, thus:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): High, let's estimate this as 0.8.

- **Business Administration (BA)**
  - Traits like solving puzzles and high intelligence are relevant.
  - Strong empathy and warm heart may slightly align with BA if considering corporate social responsibility, etc.
  - However, lack of direct connection to nature and animals may reduce relevance.
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Moderate, let's estimate this as 0.3.

With similar \( P(H) \) for both, the posterior probabilities are primarily driven by these likelihoods:

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since the normalization factor \( P(E) \) is common, it cancels out when comparing between fields:

### Relative Posterior Probabilities

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.3 * 0.5
}

Thus, normalizing these:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx \frac{0.4}{0.55} \approx 0.727 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.15}{0.4 + 0.15} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.55} \approx 0.273 \)
}

Thus, the normalized posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}

Please note that while our priors \( P(H) \) assumed equal likelihood for simplicity, variation in actual enrollment rates per field could modify these results.
