To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand the components involved in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We're interested in the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of the personality sketch (which serves as a normalizing constant).

Since we do not have actual statistical values, we will have to make reasoned estimations based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Let’s break this down:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** Let's assume an estimated prior probability based on typical university enrollment ratios. Let’s say an average graduate program has around 5% enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, a strong empathy, a love for nature and plants, and an appreciation for hard work (which is important in agriculture and veterinary science), the likelihood could be relatively high. For estimation, let's use 0.8.
  
### Business Administration
1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \)):** Given that business administration programs are typically more common, let's assume a higher prior, say around 15%.
2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):** The likelihood is significantly lower since Adam's interests and personality traits don't strongly align with stereotypical traits of business administration students. Let’s generously estimate it as 0.1.

### Calculation
Because the total probability \( P(E) \) normalizes the results and we are asked for individual probabilities relative to the given categories, the estimated values should be straightforward as:

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Note:** \( P(E) \) typically would involve summing over all possible fields, but this normalization is not needed precisely since we're only comparing estimates for the two fields mentioned.

Thus, the posterior probabilities (normalized within the context of these two fields) would be approximately calculated as:

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \times 0.05 \approx 0.04 \]

**For Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E) = 0.1 \times 0.15 \approx 0.015 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.015
}
```

These values suggest that given Adam's personality sketch, he is more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration in 2021.
