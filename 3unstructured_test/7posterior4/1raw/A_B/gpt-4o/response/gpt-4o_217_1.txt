Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of evidence \(E\).

For a simplified calculation (since we lack detailed priors and exact likelihoods), we can focus on \(P(E|H)\) for each field and infer approximate values based on the given personality traits and typical characteristics of students in those fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy, this field seems highly relevant.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) would be high because the traits fit well with interests and skills needed in this field.
   - Prior \(P(H)\) may be moderate as this field is specialized and less common than some mainstream subjects.
   - Estimation: A higher conditional probability.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's personality suggests he might not fit as well in a business environment, which often requires more social interaction and a different skill set.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) would be lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Prior \(P(H)\) may be higher for business as it has a larger pool of students typically.
   - Estimation: A lower conditional probability.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate relative probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```
These values are rough estimates. For precise values, you would need more detailed priors and likelihoods.
