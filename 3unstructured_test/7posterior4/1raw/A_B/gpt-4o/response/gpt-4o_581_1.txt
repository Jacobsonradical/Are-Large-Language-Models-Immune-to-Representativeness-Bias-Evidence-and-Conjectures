To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, without specific data for these, we can reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch and infer some approximate likelihoods.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's make some reasoned approximations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume equal prior probabilities \( P(H) = 0.5 \) for each field since specific data isn't provided.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's profile, a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy, it is more likely he would fit well in "agricultural and veterinary science" rather than "business administration".

Based on these qualitative assessments:
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for "agricultural and veterinary science" can be considered quite high since this field aligns well with Adam's interests and qualities.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for "business administration" might be lower because his personality sketch does not align as closely with typical traits and interests for that field.

Now, let's put some approximate values:
- Suppose \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
- Suppose \( P(E| \text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields, we can simplify the ratio comparison without its exact value. The adjusted posterior probabilities would reflect the likelihood values directly, assuming equal priors.

Using these approximate observations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the given personality sketch, itâ€™s more likely that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
