To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration.

We don't have specific data for these priors, so we'll assume equal priors for simplicity, which means we focus on \( P(E|H) \).

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems more likely that he would be involved in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration. Here's a qualitative estimate:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high because his curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is lower because while his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills could be relevant, his interest in nature, plants, and animals might not align as closely.

Given these assumptions, we will assign subjective probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

Please note that these values are qualitative and subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch. The probabilities do not sum to 1 since there are other fields of graduate study not considered in these hypotheses.
