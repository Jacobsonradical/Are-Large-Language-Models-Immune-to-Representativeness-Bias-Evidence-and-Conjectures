To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand the basic formulation of Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence.

Given that we don't have specific quantitative values for the likelihood, prior probability, and evidence, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He shows strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

   Given these points, it seems likely that Adam's traits align well with someone pursuing a field related to agriculture and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles (which can fit for problem-solving in business).
   - He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (also valuable in business).
   - However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem less directly relevant to the typical profile of a business administration student.

Using qualitative reasoning and based on the traits provided, here are the likely posterior conditional probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,  // High probability due to strong alignment with his traits.
  "business administration": 0.2             // Lower probability, though not impossible, given his intellectual traits.
}

Again, these values are based on qualitative assessment, as precise probabilities would require more detailed statistical data.
