To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), an exact numerical value cannot be precisely calculated. Instead, we can reason qualitatively about the plausibility of Adam being enrolled in the specified fields based on the given personality sketch.

Adam's characteristics suggest a strong alignment with fields related to nature, animals, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts. This makes it likely that his interests align more with agricultural and veterinary sciences than with business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, let us provide approximate values that reflect the relative likelihoods.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

These values suggest that it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to business administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
