To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which represents how likely it is to observe the personality sketch \( E \) if the subject is enrolled in that field. Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make qualitative assessments based on typical characteristics associated with these fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and warm heart, it is highly likely that he would be studying a field related to agriculture or veterinary science. These characteristics align well with the demands and interests of this field.

- \( P(H_{\text{agriculture, vet}}) \): Prior probability of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science could be lower compared to more popular fields like business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture, vet}}) \): High likelihood, as his personality traits match the typical interests and skills required in this field.

### Business Administration

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and quiet demeanor are less indicative of a typical business administration student. Business administration often attracts individuals who are outgoing, enjoy leadership, and may not necessarily have a strong inclination towards nature or animals.

- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): Higher prior probability as business administration is a common choice among graduate students.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): Lower likelihood, as his personality traits do not align well with what is typically expected in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provisionally assign probabilities reflecting the higher fit with agricultural and veterinary science and lower fit with business administration.

Here's a possible quantitative approximation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

### Rationale
- **High likelihood** for agricultural and veterinary science (0.75) based on Adam's traits and interests, suggesting a strong fit.
- **Low likelihood** for business administration (0.10), as Adam's traits are not usually aligned with the typical business administration student profile. 

These values are heuristic and based on the qualitative matching of Adam's personality traits with the potential fields of study, not on precise statistical data.
