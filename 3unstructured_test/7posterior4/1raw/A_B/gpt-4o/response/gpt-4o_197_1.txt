To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field, and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given the field. However, since we don't have precise values or prior probabilities, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the provided information.

Given Adam's personality sketch—curiosity about nature, interest in puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication—he seems more likely to be in a field related to biology, agriculture, or veterinary science rather than business administration.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact numerical data, this will be a qualitative estimation.

### Assumptions:
1. The prior probability that a random graduate student is in business administration, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \), could be around 0.2 based on general popularity.
2. The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science, \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \), could be around 0.1 because it's less popular than business administration.
3. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch for business administration might be relatively low given the traits don't typically align closely with that field.
4. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is very high due to the alignment of interests and traits.

### Estimations:
- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be low, say 0.1, because the traits described are not strongly characteristic of business administration students.

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) might be high, say 0.8, because the traits strongly align with students in this field.

### Posterior Probability Calculation:
Assume \( P(E) \) is uniform across the fields for simplicity, then:

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

These values suggest that it is significantly more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.

Returning these qualitative probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
