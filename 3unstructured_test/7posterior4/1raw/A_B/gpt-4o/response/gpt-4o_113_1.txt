To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we will need the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \) - the total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will need to make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and the likely relevance of these characteristics to the fields of study.

### Assessing \( P(E|H) \)

- **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
  - Strong curiosity about nature and plants.
  - Warm heart and empathy (important for interacting with animals).
  - Deep love for animals.
  These factors indicate that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high.

- **Business administration:**
  - Enjoys solving puzzles (could be applicable to problem-solving in business).
  - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts (relevant to strategic thinking in business).
  While these traits are valuable, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are less relevant directly.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)

Given no specific numerical data, we will consider the general distribution of graduate students across different fields. We can qualitatively assert that agricultural and veterinary sciences may have fewer students compared to a widespread field like business administration.

### Total Probability \( P(E) \)

This is a normalization factor, which we don’t need for comparing relative probabilities across different fields here.

### Posterior Probabilities

Let's assume qualitative assessments of the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.4 \)

And assume prior probabilities indicative of relative popularity (hypothetically):
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3 \)

Using these for qualitative assessment:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

### Normalized (Qualitative) Results:

Assuming normalization isn’t needed for comparison, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": ~0.16,
  "business administration": ~0.12
}

For simplicity and direct interpretation without exact numerical normalizations, let’s present the results between 0 and 1 based directly on our qualitative conclusions.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.16",
  "business administration": "0.12"
}
