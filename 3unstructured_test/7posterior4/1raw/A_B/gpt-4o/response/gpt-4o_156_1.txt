To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need three components for each field:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in the specific field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in the specific field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which serves as a normalizing factor.

Since we don't have actual numerical values for these probabilities and for simplicity, we will examine the qualitative aspects to estimate \( P(E|H) \).

### Estimations

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch being in business administration is likely lower. Traits like a strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoying solving puzzles might not typically align as strongly with the common characteristics of students in business administration.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Similarly, the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality sketch being in agricultural and veterinary science is higher. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \) is relatively high.

Without specific data on \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we will qualitatively assign higher values to fields where Adam's traits are more probable.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can represent the results as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration**: Low probability (\(0.1\)) due to less alignment with Adam's personality traits.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High probability (\(0.8\)) due to strong alignment with Adam's personality traits.

These estimates are subjective and based on matching Adam's traits to fields of study qualitatively. For precise numerical calculations, statistical data on each component would be necessary.
