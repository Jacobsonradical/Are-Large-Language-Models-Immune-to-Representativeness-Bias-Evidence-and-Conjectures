To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the following:

1. **Bayes' rule formula:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **P(H)** is the prior probability of Adam being in each field.
3. **P(E|H)** is the probability of Adam showing the described personality traits given he is in each field.
4. **P(E)** is the overall probability of someone having Adamâ€™s personality traits.

Since the prior probabilities and specific likelihood values are not given, the values provided here are subjective estimates based on the provided traits and typical characteristics of the fields:

### Estimates:
- **P(H) for each field:** Without specific data, we might assume fields like agricultural and veterinary science are less commonly chosen than business administration among typical graduate students.
- **P(E|H) for each field:** Observable character traits such as empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

### Subjective probabilities:
1. **P(H) (Prior) for agricultural and veterinary science:**
   Let's assume a lower starting point due to the lower overall enrolment in such specialized fields.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1
   \]

2. **P(H) (Prior) for business administration:**
   A more common choice owing to generally high enrolment.
   \[
   P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3
   \]

3. **P(E|H) (Likelihood) for agricultural and veterinary science:**
   Adam's traits are highly relevant to this field. High probability.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8
   \]

4. **P(E|H) (Likelihood) for business administration:**
   Adam's traits are less relevant to this field. Lower probability.
   \[
   P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2
   \]

### Normalized calculations (since P(E) is unknown, comparison based):
Considering both fields, we can normalize within our chosen fields:

1. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.08}{0.14} \approx 0.57
   \]

2. For **business administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3} = \frac{0.06}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.14} \approx 0.43
   \]

Thus, the subjective posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.43
}
```
