To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have exact numerical values, we'll make educated assumptions based on our understanding of Adam's personality and the typical characteristics of students in each field.

Let's consider the two hypotheses:
1. \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
2. \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We will make qualitative assessments of \( P(E|H) \) based on the likelihood of someone with Adam's personality characteristics being in each field. We'll also make assumptions regarding \( P(H) \).

### Assumptions:

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
  - **Business Administration:**
    - Business administration students are typically associated with leadership, management, finance, and economics rather than a love for nature and animals.
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) could be relatively low because Adam’s specific characteristics align less with typical business administration interests.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - This field involves a strong understanding of nature, plants, and animals, which aligns closely with Adam's interests.
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) could be relatively high because Adam's personality sketch fits well with this field.

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
  - **Business Administration:** This is a broad and popular field, so the prior could be higher.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This is a more specialized field, so the prior could be lower.

- **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This remains the same across hypotheses, so it will cancel out when comparing the ratios.

### Qualitative Estimates:

Given our qualitative assessments, here is a rough estimation for Adam’s probabilities:

\[
\{
  \text{"business administration"}: 0.1,
  \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.8
\}
\]

These estimates reflect that Adam’s traits make it much more likely for him to be enrolled in a field related to nature and animals than in business administration.
