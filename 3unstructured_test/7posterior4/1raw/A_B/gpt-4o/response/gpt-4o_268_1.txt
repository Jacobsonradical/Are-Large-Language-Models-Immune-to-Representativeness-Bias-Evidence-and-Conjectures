To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that the evidence matches when the hypothesis is true.

Bayes' rule is given by: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- Equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) because we don't have specific enrollment stats.
- Higher likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for fields closely aligned with Adam's personality.

Let's assume these generalized likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) for business administration, considering it doesn't closely align with Adam's described interests and traits.
- \( P(E|H) = 0.7 \) for agricultural and veterinary science, considering the strong match with Adam's empathy, love for animals, and nature.

Then:
\[ P(H|E_{business}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E_{agricultural}) = \frac{0.7 \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) will cancel out if the priors are equal:

\[ P(H|E_{business}) \propto 0.2 \cdot P(H_{business}) \]
\[ P(H|E_{agricultural}) \propto 0.7 \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) \]
With equal priors simplifying the calculation:

\[
\begin{cases}
P(H|E_{business}) \approx 0.2 \\
P(H|E_{agricultural}) \approx 0.7
\end{cases}
\]

Hence:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
