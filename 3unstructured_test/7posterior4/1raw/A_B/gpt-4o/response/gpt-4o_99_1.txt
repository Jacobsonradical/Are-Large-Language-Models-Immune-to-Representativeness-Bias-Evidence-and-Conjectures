To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to have the prior probabilities and likelihoods related to Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given \( H \). However, since the prior probabilities and likelihoods are not specified in the problem, I will provide a qualitative assessment instead, based on the information given in the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) before seeing evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given Adam's characteristics (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, warm-hearted, strong empathy, deep love for animals, high intelligence, appreciation for hard work and dedication), we can qualitatively assess his fit for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assuming a reasonable prior probability for this field.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam’s characteristics, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration is lower compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science as business does not directly align with his expressed interests and traits.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assuming a reasonable prior probability for this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, the posterior probabilities without exact numerical values but based on the qualitative fit can be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "approximately 0.8 (high likelihood based on interests and empathy)",
  "business administration": "approximately 0.2 (lower likelihood based on interests and traits)"
}
```

These values are not precise calculations but are reasonable approximations based on the given information. Exact probabilities would require concrete prior probabilities and likelihoods.
