To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are computing relative probabilities and \( P(E) \) remains constant for all hypotheses, we will focus on comparing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration,
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we consider:

1. **P(E|H1)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality (curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence in abstract concepts, empathy, etc.) fits someone enrolled in Business Administration.
2. **P(E|H2)**: The likelihood that Adam's personality fits someone enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

It is more likely that someone with a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work would be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Conversely, these traits are less characteristic of someone in Business Administration.

However, without concrete data on the priors \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \), we'll make an educated assumption that these likelihoods are distinct enough to inform our relative comparisons.

### Assumptions:
- **P(H1)** and **P(H2)** might be similar if we assume a balanced number of students in both fields.
- **P(E|H1)**: Considering the alignment, let's assume a low probability, say \( 0.1 \).
- **P(E|H2)**: Given Adamâ€™s interests and traits, this is higher, let's assume \( 0.7 \).

Assuming equal priors for simplicity (\( P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5 \)):

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = 0.35 \]

Since we're interested in the relative scale, we don't need to normalize these values.

Therefore, in relative terms:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35
}
```

These values indicate that based on the provided personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration.
