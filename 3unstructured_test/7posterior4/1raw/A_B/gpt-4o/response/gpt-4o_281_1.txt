To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to outline the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we lack specific numbers for priors and likelihoods, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the context of Adam's personality sketch:

1. **business administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): People in business administration may occasionally have empathy and problem-solving skills, but a love for nature and animals is less common.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a popular field, so prior probability is not very low, but not extremely high either for someone with Adam's attributes.
   - Overall, the likelihood of Adam fitting the given personality sketch in business administration is relatively low.

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science students frequently have a fascination with nature, a love for animals, and strong dedication. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - \( P(H) \): Given Adam's traits, the prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high compared to other fields.

Given these observations, though I can't provide exact numbers, I can give qualitative assessments:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

These values reflect a higher posterior probability for Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch compared to business administration.
