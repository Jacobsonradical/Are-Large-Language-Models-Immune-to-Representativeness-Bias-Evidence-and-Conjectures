To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \), we have to use Bayes' Rule, which is stated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To complete this calculation, we need values for \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in either field \( H \)), \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field), and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing the personality traits \( E \)).

Unfortunately, we do not have concrete data to provide specific numerical values for these probabilities. However, given the description of Adam's personality, we can qualitatively assess whether traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts are more likely to be associated with "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration".

### Heuristics-based qualitative assessment:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: High. Adam's traits match well with this field. Curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals are key traits in this field.
   - **P(H)**: Assume a moderate baseline prior probability as agricultural and veterinary science is a distinct yet less common graduate field compared with business administration.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Low. Adam's traits do not strongly align with the typical traits of business administration students, who are often more focused on management, economics, and organizational behavior, which may not prioritize empathy, nature, and animals to a high degree.
   - **P(H)**: Assume a higher or equal baseline prior probability as business administration is a common graduate field.

Given the likely higher \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration and equal or higher \( P(H) \) (prior probability for business administration), we can tentatively conclude that the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher.

Using heuristic assignment rather than precise calculation due to lack of exact data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",  // Higher likelihood given the alignment with personality traits
  "business administration": "0.25"  // Lower likelihood given a misalignment with personality traits
}
```

These values are estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than exact calculations. If we had concrete data regarding the distribution of personality traits in each field, we could provide more accurate probabilities.
