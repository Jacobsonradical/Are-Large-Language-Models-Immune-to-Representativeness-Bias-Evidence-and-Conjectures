To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) — the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true. Without explicit data on these probabilities, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions and the details given in the personality sketch.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information in the personality sketch, Adam demonstrates interests and characteristics that are more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Here’s a basic outline of the assumptions and reasoning used for our estimates:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \):
   - Let's assume graduate fields are distributed uniformly without further specific data on their actual distribution.
   - For simplicity, \( P(H) \) for both fields might be roughly equal.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **For Business Administration:**
     - The key personality traits related to nature, empathy, and animals are less directly related to business administration.
     - Assume \(P(E|H_{\text{BA}})\) is relatively low.
   - **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
     - The personality sketch fits well: interest in nature, empathy, care for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
     - Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is relatively high.

Given these assumptions, we can outline our posterior probabilities qualitatively, though not with precise numerical accuracy.

### Rough Estimates:

For Business Administration (H_{\text{BA}}):
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.5 \) (prior, assuming equal distribution among fields).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (low likelihood given the inconsistency with personality traits).

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H_{\text{AVS}}):
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.5 \) (prior, assuming equal distribution among fields).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the strong alignment with personality traits).

Thus, our rough estimates would be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values suggest that based on the provided personality sketch, it is much more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration. Note that these are qualitative estimates reflecting the contextual fit rather than mathematically precise probabilities.
