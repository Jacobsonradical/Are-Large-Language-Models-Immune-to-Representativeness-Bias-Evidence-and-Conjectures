To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis given the evidence, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence across all possible fields.

Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and only qualitative details for \( P(E|H) \), I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and fields of study.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration generally involves strong skills in management, leadership, and often quantitative analysis. While these might align with high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, it does not strongly align with an interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles in a straightforward way.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) and thus \( P(H|E) \) might be lower for business administration given Adam's described interests and traits.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field strongly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy. His high intelligence and appreciation for hard work would also fit well within the rigorous scientific and hands-on aspects of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) and thus \( P(H|E) \) would be higher for agricultural and veterinary science given the strong correlation between Adam's traits and the field's demands.

Given these qualitative considerations, here are the posterior conditional probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

Please note that these values are approximate and based on qualitative judgment rather than quantitative analysis due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood data.
