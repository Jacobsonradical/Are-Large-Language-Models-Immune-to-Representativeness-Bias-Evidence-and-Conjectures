To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \), which acts as a normalizing constant.

In this context:
- \( E \) is Adam's personality sketch.
- \( H \) can be either he was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration".

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's intuitively analyze the likelihoods and priors:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which suggests a high likelihood for this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability for this field within graduate students is moderate to low, given the specificity of the field.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interests and personality traits seem less aligned with this field, suggesting a lower likelihood.
   - \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability for this field within graduate students is relatively high, given its popularity.

Since exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \) are difficult to determine without specific data on enrollment figures and Adam's background, subjective analysis will be used to estimate probabilities.

Using educated estimations:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,  // High likelihood given Adam's traits.
  "business administration": 0.1  // Low likelihood given Adam's traits.
}

The exact values are illustrative and represent a subjective assessment based on the given personality sketch. They could vary with more precise statistical data.
