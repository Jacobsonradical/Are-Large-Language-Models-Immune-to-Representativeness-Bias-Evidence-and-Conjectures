To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, but we can make qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch and the fields in question.

First, let's define the hypotheses:
- \( H_{\text{BA}} \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_{\text{AVS}} \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

In the absence of specific prior probabilities, we assume that \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) are based on general enrollment statistics in graduate programs. 

Next, consider the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \).

Based on personality sketch \( E \):
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication.
- These traits strongly suggest a fit for agricultural and veterinary science more than for business administration.

### Likelihood Estimation
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is likely to be low because the traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals) do not strongly correlate with business administration.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is likely to be high as these traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative estimates, the calculation simplifies to comparing the likelihoods under the given hypotheses. Since the priors are assumed equal, the posterior probabilities will be heavily influenced by the likelihoods.

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \text{ will be relatively low} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \text{ will be relatively high} \]

### Summary
{
  "business administration": "0.1",  // low likelihood given personality sketch
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"  // high likelihood given personality sketch
}

These values are estimations to reflect the qualitative likelihoods given the personality information. For exact numerical probabilities, detailed data on the priors and likelihoods would be required.
