To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, for this calculation, we need the following elements that are not provided:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field without any knowledge about his personality.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) in the general population across all fields. 

Since the exact prior, likelihood, and evidence values are unknown, we will make educated guesses based on the information given in the personality sketch. 

Given the information about Adam's intellectual interests and empathetic nature, we can make the following intuitive assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 based on a hypothetical distribution of graduate fields.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for animals, intellectual curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood is relatively high. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume P(H) = 0.1 based on a hypothetical distribution of graduate fields.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, the likelihood is relatively low. Let's assume P(E|H) = 0.2.

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is a constant and since we are only calculating relative values, it can be ignored. Thus, the comparison can be made using \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)
  \( P(H|E)_{agri} \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)

- **Business Administration**:
  \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)
  \( P(H|E)_{biz} \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.02 \)

Considering these relative values, we can assign:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Here, the values between 0 and 1 represent the relative strengths of the probabilities, not the actual probabilities.
