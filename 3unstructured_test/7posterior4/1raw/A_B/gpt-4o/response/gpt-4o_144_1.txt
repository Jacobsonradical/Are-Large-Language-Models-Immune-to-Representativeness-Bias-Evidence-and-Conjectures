To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

Given only the personality sketch (E) and the fields in question, we will need to make some educated assumptions about the likelihoods and priors. Let's break it down:

- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) are observed if he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality traits are observed if he is in business administration.

Given the strong match between Adam's traits and the field of agricultural and veterinary science, we'll assume:
\[ P(E|H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.1 \]

For the prior probabilities \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) and \( P(H_{business}) \), we can estimate based on the general distribution of graduate students in these fields. Let's assume:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{business}) \approx 0.2 \]

Finally, \( P(E) \) can be seen as a normalizing factor and doesn't need to be computed exactly for the comparison of two fields.

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

These values indicate that the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher than that for business administration. Hence, the probabilities can be normalized relative to each other:

\[
\{ 
"agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.02} = 0.80,
"business administration": \frac{0.02}{0.08 + 0.02} = 0.20 
\}
\]

So the resulting probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.20
}
```
