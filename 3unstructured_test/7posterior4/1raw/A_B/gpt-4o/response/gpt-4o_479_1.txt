To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

However, given the information in the question, we lack specific prior probabilities and likelihoods. Instead, we can make qualitative assessments based on the context provided.

### Analysis of Fields:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He loves animals deeply.
- He has empathy and a warm heart, suitable for caring professions involving animals.
- His intelligence and understanding of hard work align with the demanding nature of this field.

Given these traits, it seems highly probable that Adam might pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.

**Business Administration:**
- This field is less directly aligned with Adam's specific interests and traits mentioned (nature, puzzles, empathy for animals).
- While intelligence and problem-solving skills are applicable in business, the sketch emphasizes areas that are less related to business interests.

Based on qualitative analysis, itâ€™s less likely that Adam is pursuing business administration.

Given this, here is a qualitative approximation of the probabilities (Note: these are not precise calculations but estimates based on contextual alignment):

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

Explanation:
- "Agricultural and veterinary science" receives a high probability due to the alignment of Adam's interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
- "Business administration" receives a low probability due to the weaker relation to Adam's noted characteristics.
