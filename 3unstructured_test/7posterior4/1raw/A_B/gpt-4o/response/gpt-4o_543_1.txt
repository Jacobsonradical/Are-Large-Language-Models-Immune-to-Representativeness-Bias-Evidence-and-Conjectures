To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch (E) given his enrollment in each field (H), the prior probabilities of enrollment in each field (P(H)), and the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (P(E)).

Bayes' rule is represented as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this exercise, we don't have exact numerical data for prior probabilities or the likelihood function, so we'll need to make some reasoned approximations based on the given information.

### Reasoning:
1. **Business Administration (H1):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \): Business Administration typically doesn't align strongly with characteristics like a deep curiosity about nature, love for animals, and dedication to understanding plants. The fit seems weaker.
   - Prior \( P(H1) \): Business degrees are common, so the prior might be relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science aligns very well with Adam's passion for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work. The fit is strong.
   - Prior \( P(H2) \): Less common than Business Administration, but still significant.

Given the descriptions and assuming all other factors are equal:
- \( P(E|H2) > P(E|H1) \)
- \( P(H1) \) might be higher than \( P(H2) \)

Given the strong fit for Agricultural and Veterinary Science and the weaker fit for Business Administration, it's reasonable to assume:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are speculative and illustrative, reflecting that Adam's personality traits fit better with Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.
