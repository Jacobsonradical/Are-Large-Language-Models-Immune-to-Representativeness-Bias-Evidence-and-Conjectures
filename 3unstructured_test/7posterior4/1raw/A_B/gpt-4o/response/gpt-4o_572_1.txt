Sure, I can help with that. To apply Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) and likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)), we can only make qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch provided. Here are some rough estimates based on how well the personality traits align with the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Based on the description, Adam seems more likely to have an interest that aligns closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration, considering his love for nature, animals, and his empathetic and quiet demeanor. In contrast, business administration typically demands outgoing, assertive, and competitive traits which are not mentioned in Adam's sketch.

So, the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values are qualitative assessments rather than precise percentages. More detailed information or statistical data about typical personality profiles in these fields would be needed for a more accurate computation.
