{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

### Business Administration

- Adam's described traits do not strongly align with typical traits associated with a business administration focus, such as interest in economics, management, marketing, and finance.
- His attributes like curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are not particularly indicative of a business administration student.
- Thus, the probability remains relatively low for business administration.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his deep love for animals, aligns strongly with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science.
- These fields would benefit from his high intelligence, empathy, and dedication.
- Therefore, the probability for agricultural and veterinary science is much higher, given his personality sketch.
