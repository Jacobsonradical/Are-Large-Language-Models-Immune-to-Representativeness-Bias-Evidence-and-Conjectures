To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some information about the prior probabilities (i.e., the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch) and the likelihood (i.e., the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is in each field). Since we lack specific numerical data for these values, I will assume hypothetical but reasonable values based on common knowledge. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that any given graduate student in the U.S. is in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.1 and in business administration is 0.2. 
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch suggests that Adam is well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature, plants, and animals, and less so for business administration as his traits do not strongly align with typical business characteristics.

Assuming reasonable values for these likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

Bayes' Rule says:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) represents the total probability of the evidence and can be calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + \text{(other fields)} \]

Using the assumed values:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \times 0.1) + (0.1 \times 0.2) + \text{(other fields)} \]
Since we are only computing relative probabilities for the specified fields, we do not need the exact total.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.09}{\text{something}} = \text{significant portion of numerator} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.02}{\text{same something}} = \text{much smaller portion} \]

The values will not be precise percentages since we are ignoring other fields, but relatively:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.82 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.18 \]

Hence, the probabilities might be approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.82,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
```

This approximation indicates that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science relative to business administration, given his personality traits and interests as described.
