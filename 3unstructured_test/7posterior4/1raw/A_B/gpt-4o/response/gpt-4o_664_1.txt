To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following factors:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities nor exact likelihoods, we can make some informed estimates based on typical graduate programs:

For "agricultural and veterinary science," Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align with characteristics often found in this field.

For "business administration," while Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align, his empathy and love for nature and animals don't align as closely with the stereotypical traits associated with business administration students.

Let's assume the following rough estimates:

1. Prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) based on the number of graduate students typically enrolled in such programs:
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.15 \)

2. Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \) (fits well with Adam's description)
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \) (fits less well with Adam's description)

Since we are primarily interested in comparing these specific hypotheses, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) exactly. Instead, we can compare the unnormalized posterior probabilities and normalize them appropriately.

Thus, the unnormalized posterior probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Now, we normalize:

Total = \( 0.04 + 0.03 = 0.07 \)

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.07} \approx 0.571 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.07} \approx 0.429 \]

So, the final approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.429
}
