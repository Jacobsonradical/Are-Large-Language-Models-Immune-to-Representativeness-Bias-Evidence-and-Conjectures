To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we first need to know the following:

1. **Prior probability, P(H):** The probability that Adam would be enrolled in a particular field of study before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that specific field.
3. **Marginal likelihood, P(E):** The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote the fields as follows:
- \( H_1 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( H_2 \): Business Administration

However, without specific numerical values for P(H₁), P(H₂), P(E|H₁), P(E|H₂), and P(E), we'll make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
   - Let's assume students enroll in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (P(H₁)) and Business Administration (P(H₂)) equally likely, so we assign each a prior probability of 0.5 for simplicity, although in reality these numbers may differ based on student distribution.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):**
   - The likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with students in agricultural and veterinary science (P(E|H₁)) is quite high considering his love for nature, animals, and empathy.
   - The likelihood for business administration (P(E|H₂)) is lower compared to agricultural sciences, given that his interests and personality traits align less with the typical business administration profile.

3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E)):**
   - This is the normalization factor but is not straightforward to compute without specific data. We will treat it as a constant when comparing fields.

Let's assign qualitative likelihood values:
- P(E|H₁) = 0.9
- P(E|H₂) = 0.2

Now, using Bayes' rule, we'll compare these probabilities:

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₁):
\[ P(H₁|E) = \frac{P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \propto P(E|H₁) \cdot P(H₁) \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(H₁|E) \propto 0.45 \]

### For Business Administration (H₂):
\[ P(H₂|E) = \frac{P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \propto P(E|H₂) \cdot P(H₂) \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(H₂|E) \propto 0.1 \]

The posterior probabilities are proportional to these computed values. Since we are not required for normalization across other fields, we can use these proportions to derive the conditional probabilities in a relative sense:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.45",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

These values reflect the greater alignment between Adam's personality traits and the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences compared to Business Administration.
