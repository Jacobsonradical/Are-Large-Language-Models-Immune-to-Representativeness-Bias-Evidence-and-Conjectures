To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since we do not have specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we need to make some educated guesses based on typical scenarios. We can qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

### Intuitive Assignment of Probabilities

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in business administration. This field is popular, so we might say this is moderate (say, roughly 0.3 or 30%).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of a student in business administration possessing Adam's qualities of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and high empathy is relatively low, as these qualities are more aligned with fields like agricultural or veterinary sciences. Let's assume a low probability of 0.05 (or 5%).
   - **\( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing a student with Adam's specific traits is unknown but constant across both hypotheses.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a student being in agricultural and veterinary science. This field is less common than business administration, so let's assign a lower prior (say, roughly 0.1 or 10%).
   - **\( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam's traits being present in a student in agricultural and veterinary science is high given the alignment of interests and characteristics. Let's assume a relatively high probability of 0.7 (or 70%).

### Calculation:
To simplify our calculations without knowing \( P(E) \), we will assume it to be constant and focus on comparative magnitudes of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.05 \times 0.3 = 0.015 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.1 = 0.07 \]

Given these proportions and without normalization to a sum of 1, we derive our qualitative posterior conditional probabilities.

### Answers:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.015,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07
}
```

These values suggest that, based on the given personality traits, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
