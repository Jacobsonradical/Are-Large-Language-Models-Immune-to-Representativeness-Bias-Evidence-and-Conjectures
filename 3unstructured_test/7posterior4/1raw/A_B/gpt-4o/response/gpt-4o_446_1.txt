To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each of the specified fields using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihoods P(E|H). However, these values are not given directly in this context, so we will have to make some reasonable assumptions based on typical graduate enrollment statistics and the information provided about Adam's characteristics.

Bayes' rule is: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we can assess how well each field (H) aligns with his traits to estimate the likelihoods P(E|H). Let's consider the defining traits and how they might match the characteristics generally associated with students of those fields.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits like love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and quiet personality might not strongly correlate with business administration.
   - P(E|H) for business administration could be relatively low, considering these traits.
   - Assuming the number of students enrolled in business administration programs is high due to its popularity, P(H) is relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Traits like genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - P(E|H) for agricultural and veterinary science would be higher due to characteristic alignment.
   - Given the relatively specialized nature of this field, P(H) might be lower compared to business administration.

Assuming P(E) remains constant across both fields, our comparative assessment will focus on P(E|H) and P(H).

Let's assign reasonable values based on these assessments:

- For business administration:
  - P(H): 0.3 (Assuming 30% of all graduate students are in business administration)
  - P(E|H): 0.1 (Low likelihood that Adam's personality fits business administration)

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  - P(H): 0.05 (Assuming 5% of all graduate students are in this field)
  - P(E|H): 0.7 (High likelihood that Adam's personality fits this field)

Given these estimates:
- For business administration: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \)

Then normalize these values:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.035} \approx 0.46 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{0.035}{0.03 + 0.035} \approx 0.54 \]

The numbers have been rounded for simplicity.

Here are the estimates in the required format:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.46,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54
}
