To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following steps for each hypothesis:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of a hypothesis before seeing the evidence \( E \). If we don't have specific information about the proportions of students in each field, we treat them with the assumption of equal likelihood. However, in practice, these probabilities might be different and usually, the number of students in business administration generally exceeds those in agricultural and veterinary science. 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true. We examine how well Adam’s characteristics fit the typical profile of a student in each field.

3. **Normalizing constant \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the evidence regardless of the hypothesis, which can be seen as a summation over all possible fields.

Since we don't have concrete statistical data for exact numerical calculation, we will make an educated guess based on the given personality sketch and our understanding of the respective fields.

**Assumptions:**
- We'll assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are not exactly equal but close due to lack of concrete data.
- Likelihoods are estimated based on how well Adam's profile matches typical students in each field.

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**

Given Adam’s curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is reasonable to infer that he is more likely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

### Estimation:

- **Business Administration**:
  - Prior Likelihood P(H) ≈ 0.6 (assuming a larger number of students).
  - Likelihood P(E|H) is relatively low because his profile does not fit the typical traits associated with business administration students.
  - Posterior P(H|E) = (relatively low due to poor match).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Prior Likelihood P(H) ≈ 0.4 (assuming fewer students but his profile fits well).
  - Likelihood P(E|H) is high because his traits align well with interests in agriculture and veterinary science.
  - Posterior P(H|E) = (relatively high due to strong match).

Thus, we get:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Notes:
- These values illustrate estimated probabilities based on matching his profile to the fields. Without real data, exact figures can't be provided, but the trend is clear: Adam matches agricultural and veterinary science better than business administration.
