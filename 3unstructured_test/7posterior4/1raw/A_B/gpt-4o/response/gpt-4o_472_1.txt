To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

We need to consider the following aspects to compute these probabilities:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \).
2. Likelihoods \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \).
3. Evidence \( P(E) \) which acts as a normalizing constant but isn't needed for comparison.

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, it seems that the traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are much more aligned with fields related to agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

To proceed:
- We'll set plausible estimates for the prior probabilities based on typical distributions of graduate students in various fields.
- We'll give rough estimates of the likelihoods based on how well the personality sketch matches each field.

### Assigning Priors
We'll use a heuristic approach for the priors:
- There are a large number of students in business administration, but specifics about nature and animals would not be common.
- Students in agricultural and veterinary sciences, although fewer, match the description closely.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(H_1) = 0.3 \] (since business administration is a wider field but less relevant)
\[ P(H_2) = 0.1 \] (since agricultural and veterinary science is a smaller but highly relevant field for Adam)

### Assigning Likelihoods
- For \( P(E|H_1) \), the likelihood that a student in business administration matches the given personality traits is low. Let's set \( P(E|H_1) = 0.2 \). 
- For \( P(E|H_2) \), the likelihood that a student in agricultural and veterinary science matches these traits is high. Let's set \( P(E|H_2) = 0.9 \).

### Calculation
Now we can apply Bayes' rule to calculate the posteriors:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the sum for normalization and is the same in both cases, we can compare ratios without it:

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.06 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.09 \]

To normalize them so that they sum to 1:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.09} = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.06 + 0.09} = \frac{0.09}{0.15} = 0.6 \]

However, since the question allows answering without normalization as there are other fields of study, we provide them directly:

{
  "business administration": "0.06",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.09"
}
