To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the two given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several factors such as the prior probability of students enrolling in these fields and how consistent the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam is with each field.

Given the information in the personality sketch, Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and high intellect are highly consistent with a field such as agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, these traits are less directly related to a field like business administration, although some traits like high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could still be relevant.

Let's assume for simplicity that we represent our prior beliefs about Adam's likelihood of enrolling in any given field as follows:
- The prior probability \( P(\text{business administration}) \) is \( 0.3 \). 
- The prior probability \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is \( 0.1 \).

These prior probabilities should ideally be based on some population data about graduate students' enrollment, but we will use these values as illustrative.

Next, let's approximate the likelihood of \( E \) given each hypothesis. Without specific likelihood data, we'll rely on reasoned estimates:
- The likelihood \( P(E \mid \text{business administration}) \) is low, say 0.1, because Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration norms.
- The likelihood \( P(E \mid \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is high, say 0.8, since Adam's traits strongly fit this field.

Next step is normalization. However, since you requested the answer in a specific format, we will focus only on these two fields.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We can compute the unnormalized numerators for each field:
- For business administration: \( P(E \mid \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(E \mid \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)

Since we're focused on relative posterior probabilities without normalizing, we get:
- \( P(\text{business administration} \mid E) = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.08) = 0.03 / 0.11 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \mid E) = 0.08 / (0.03 + 0.08) = 0.08 / 0.11 \)

Finally:
\[ P(\text{business administration} \mid E) \approx 0.2727 \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} \mid E) \approx 0.7273 \]

Formatted answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.2727,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7273
}

Note that these numeric values are estimates and the precise probabilities would ideally require more detailed prior data and likelihood estimates.
