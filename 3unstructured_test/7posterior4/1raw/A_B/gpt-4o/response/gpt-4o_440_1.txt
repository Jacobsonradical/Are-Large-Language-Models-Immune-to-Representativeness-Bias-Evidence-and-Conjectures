To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) overall.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Although we do not have concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we can make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the provided information to arrive at a relative comparison.

1. **Business Administration**
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Personality sketch given business administration): A genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a love for animals are less typical traits for a business administration student. They might still have empathy and high intelligence, but the remaining traits are less aligned.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability for business administration can be assumed moderate due to its commonness among graduate fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - \( P(E|H) \) (Personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science): This field aligns very well with the described traits, such as the love for nature, plants, animals, strong empathy, and intelligence.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability for this field might be lower compared to business administration, but the traits match well.

Considering these qualitative assessments, we can reason that:
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science}) \) is substantially higher than \( P(E|H_{business \, administration}) \).
- Without exact priors and the overall probability \( P(E) \), exact numerical values are challenging to provide, but a reasonable guess can be made based on alignments.

Therefore, the relative probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This suggests that Adam's personality sketch is much more consistent with a background in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, based on the given information.
