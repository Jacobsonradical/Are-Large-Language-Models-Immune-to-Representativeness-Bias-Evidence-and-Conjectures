To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of \( H \) given \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of observing \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, i.e., the total probability of observing \( E \).

Since detailed statistical data for exact probabilities isn't provided here, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Let's evaluate the two hypotheses:

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that a graduate student might be in this field. Given that there are many fields of study, let's assume \( P(H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.1 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, attributes such as a love for nature, plants, and animals align well with this field. This suggests a high likelihood. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.7 \).

### 2. Business Administration

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that a graduate student might be in this field. Given the popularity of business programs, let's assume \( P(H_{business}) \approx 0.15 \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s qualities of empathy, understanding of hard work, and intelligence might have some relevance, but his love for nature and animals doesn’t strongly align with typical traits for this field. Let's assume  \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.2 \).

Finally, we need to determine the evidence term \( P(E) \). For simplicity, we assume it's a common factor and focus on the conditional parts instead.

Using these assumptions:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

The ratio comparison:

- \( P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto 0.07 \)
- \( P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.03 \)

After normalizing these values (though the evidence term \( P(E) \) is the same in both denominators and would cancel out in ratios), we obtain the relative strengths.

So here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}
```

We assume these probabilities sum to one for normalization within the given options, but the real values should be interpreted relative to other potential fields not listed here.
