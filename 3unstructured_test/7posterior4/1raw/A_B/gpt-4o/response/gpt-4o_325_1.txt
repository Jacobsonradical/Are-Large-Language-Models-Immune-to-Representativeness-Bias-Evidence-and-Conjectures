To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the following:

1. **Bayes' Rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) \) is the evidence, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - For **business administration**, the personality sketch \( E \) is less aligned with typical interests and traits associated with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is relatively high.

3. **Priors** \( P(H) \):
   - Without specific data on the prior probabilities of students enrolling in these fields, we can assume they have common priors, but in practice, the number of students in business administration is typically higher than in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the qualitative nature of this problem and aiming to make reasonable assumptions, we can provide approximate values for the posterior probabilities based on the information provided:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The personality sketch \( E \) strongly aligns with characteristics relevant to agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy), so we assigned a higher probability to this field.
- The traits described in \( E \) are not typically associated with business administration, thus a lower probability is assigned to this field.

Note: These probabilities are rough qualitative estimates. For precise computation, additional data on enrollment distributions and more detailed likelihoods would be required.
