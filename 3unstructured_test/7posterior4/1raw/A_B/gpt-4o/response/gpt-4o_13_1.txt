To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the terms:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor which is the same for both fields, for simplicity and without exact numerical values for \( P(E) \), we can compare the relative probabilities using \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \). Assume both fields are equally likely before considering Adam's personality sketch, so \( P(H) \) for both fields is then equivalent and cancels out when comparing.

Let's evaluate \( P(E|H) \) for both fields based on the personality sketch provided. 

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Curiosity about nature and plants: High likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
   - Deep love for animals: High likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
   - Empathy and warm heart (relevant for veterinary care): High likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

Given these factors, \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively high for "agricultural and veterinary science."

2. **Business administration:**
   - Curiosity and love for nature/plants and animals: Less relevant for business admin \( P(E|H) \)
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: Some relevance, but not a significant indicator \( P(E|H) \)
   - Intelligence and good at abstract concepts: Relevance does exist in business, but not as strongly as the other factors for agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H) \)

Given these factors, \( P(E|H) \) should be relatively lower for "business administration" compared to "agricultural and veterinary science."

Based on the qualitative analysis, the likelihood ratios heavily support "agricultural and veterinary science" over "business administration." While exact numerical values are undefined, we can assign relative probabilities according to our qualitative assessment, ensuring the former is greater than the latter.

Thus, we can represent the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values represent an educated qualitative assumption that Adam's personality sketch strongly fits better with "agricultural and veterinary science" rather than "business administration."
