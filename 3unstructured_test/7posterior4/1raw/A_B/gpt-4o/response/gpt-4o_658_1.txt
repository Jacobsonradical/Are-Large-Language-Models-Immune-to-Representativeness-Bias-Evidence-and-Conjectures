To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require several components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of being enrolled in a particular field without any additional information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis being true.
3. **Normalization Constant \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of the evidence, which can be calculated by summing the product of the likelihood and the prior for all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, specific numerical values for the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) are not provided. Typically, these come from prior domain knowledge or empirical data. In absence of precise values, let's reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch of Adam and assume some approximate values that fit the context.

### Assumptions:

- **Prior Probabilities**:
  - Assume that, out of all possible graduate fields, the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is equal initially, given no specific preference.
  - However, Adam's attributes might suggest a stronger inclination toward some fields over others.

- **Likelihoods**:
  - The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) will be higher for fields that align well with Adam's personality.

Given the qualitative nature of the prompt:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - High likelihood due to his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy. Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.7 \)

- **Business Administration**:
  - Lower likelihood given his traits donâ€™t align closely with the typical demands and skills for business administration. Assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)

### Simplified Calculation:

Since we are providing relative rather than absolute probabilities, we won't normalize them to sum to 1.

Let's consider the prior for each field:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \]

Hence:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common denominator for both and we're interested in their relative probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

After normalization to a relative scale, the values would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.07",
  "business administration": "0.01"
}
```

Note: These values express relative likelihood rather than true posterior probabilities due to the absence of full prior distributions.
