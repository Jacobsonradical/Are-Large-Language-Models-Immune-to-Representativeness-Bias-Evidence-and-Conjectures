To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given each field (\( P(E|H) \)).

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities of each field or the likelihoods, we will make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch provided.

**Personality Sketch Assessments:**
- "Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
- "Strong empathy, and a deep love for animals" aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.
- "Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and "warm heart" does not strongly skew towards business administration.
- "High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts" could fit either field, though it does not strongly suggest either.

Given these qualitative assessments, \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is higher compared to \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \). In terms of prior probabilities, if we assume they are roughly equal without additional information, the posterior for agricultural and veterinary science would still be higher.

We can infer that the posterior for business administration is lower than that for agricultural and veterinary science. Without exact numerical data but based on a strong alignment of personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science, we can make the educated guess as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note that the values are hypothetical and based on qualitative judgment. In a real scenario, these would ideally be computed using actual statistical data regarding prior probabilities and likelihoods.
