To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., how likely \( H \) is before considering the evidence \( E \)).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, let's analyze the likelihoods and priors for the two fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with this field. Therefore, the likelihood is relatively high.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field has a smaller pool of graduate students relative to some other fields of study.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, these traits are less directly aligned with the specifics of business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the likelihood is lower.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a very popular field with a larger pool of graduate students.

Given the nature of the provided information and the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods, let's assign plausible values:

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \quad \text{(high alignment with personality traits)}
  \]
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.1 \quad \text{(considering a smaller pool of students)}
  \]

- For **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \quad \text{(lower alignment with personality traits)}
  \]
  \[
  P(H) \approx 0.4 \quad \text{(larger pool of students)}
  \]

Since we do not have actual data for \( P(E) \), we can provide relative posterior probabilities instead of precise values.

Relative posterior probabilities:
\[
P(H_1 | E) \propto P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)
\]
\[
P(H_2 | E) \propto P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Where:
- \( H_1 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( H_2 \): Business Administration

\[
P(H_1 | E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]
\[
P(H_2 | E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.4 = 0.12
\]

To provide normalized values, we would need \( P(E) \), but we can show the relative values:

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.12} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4
\]
\[
P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.08 + 0.12} = \frac{0.12}{0.2} = 0.6
\]

Hence, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.6
}
