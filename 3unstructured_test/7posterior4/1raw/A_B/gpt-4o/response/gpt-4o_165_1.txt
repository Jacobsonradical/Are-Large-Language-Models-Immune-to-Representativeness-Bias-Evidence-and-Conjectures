To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration," we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given the evidence from the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the sum of the probabilities over all fields equals 1.

We analyze how well the evidence \( E \) matches each hypothesis \( H \).

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
Let's estimate the likelihoods:

1. For "agricultural and veterinary science" (\(H_1\)):
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \) would be quite high.

2. For "business administration" (\(H_2\)):
   - Given that business administration doesn't directly relate to Adam's interests in nature, animals, and empathy, the likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \) would be relatively low in comparison.

### Prior \( P(H) \)
Without specific prior data, we may assume all fields are equally likely. However, information about graduate enrollment statistics could modify this assumption. For simplicity, we assume equal priors for both fields:

\[ P(H_1) = P(H_2) = \frac{1}{n} \]

Where \( n \) is the total number of possible graduate fields. If we only consider the two fields mentioned, then:

\[ P(H_1) = P(H_2) = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Posterior Calculation
Without an exact normalization factor to compute \( P(E) \), we focus on comparing the relative likelihoods:

1. For "agricultural and veterinary science":
   - Suppose \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.9 \) (very high due to nature and animal interests)
   - Then: \( P(H_1|E) \) is proportional to \( 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.45 \)

2. For "business administration":
   - Suppose \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.1 \) (quite low due to unrelated interests)
   - Then: \( P(H_2|E) \) is proportional to \( 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0.05 \)

While these aren't normalized probabilities, they show the strong preference towards the first hypothesis. To normalize:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.05} = \frac{0.45}{0.5} = 0.9 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.45 + 0.05} = \frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1 \]

### Final Estimate
