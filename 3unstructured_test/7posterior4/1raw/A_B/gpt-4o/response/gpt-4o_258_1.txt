To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) where \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam and \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While complete data is needed to compute exact probabilities, we can still provide educated estimates based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work align strongly with this field. We can estimate this as quite high, say 0.9.
   - \( P(H1) \): Graduate students enrolled in this field probably make up a small fraction of the total graduate population. Suppose it's about 5% or 0.05.
   
2. **Business Administration (H2)**
   - \( P(E|H2) \): Adam’s traits of empathy and intelligence are useful in business administration but his interest in nature and animals does not align perfectly. We can estimate this as moderate, say 0.2.
   - \( P(H2) \): Business administration is a very common field for graduate studies. Suppose it's about 15% or 0.15.

Next, to find \( P(E) \), we sum the products of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) over all hypotheses. For simplicity, if we consider only these two fields:
\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H1)P(H1) + P(E|H2)P(H2) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.9 \times 0.05 + 0.2 \times 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.045 + 0.03 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.075 \]

Finally, using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.075} \approx 0.6 \]

\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{0.075} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.075} \approx 0.4 \]

Hence, the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values indicate that, based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
