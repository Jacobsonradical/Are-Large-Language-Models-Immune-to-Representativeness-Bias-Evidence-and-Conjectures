To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability. This is what we want to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given the personality traits of Adam, let us denote the fields of study by:
- \( H_1 \): Business Administration
- \( H_2 \): Agricultural and Veterinary Science

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities (i.e., \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \)), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). We will make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \): The personality sketch of Adam does not strongly align with the characteristics typically associated with business administration. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could be relevant, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less typical.
     \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.1 \) (a lower likelihood given his personality traits)
   - Prior \( P(H_1) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a randomly chosen graduate student being in business administration is moderate.
     \( P(H_1) \approx 0.3 \) (assumed prior)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \): Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
     \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.8 \) (a higher likelihood given his personality traits)
   - Prior \( P(H_2) \): Let's assume the prior probability of a randomly chosen graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is lower than that of business administration.
     \( P(H_2) \approx 0.1 \) (assumed prior)

Since we don't have the exact value of \( P(E) \), we can discuss the relative posterior probabilities.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Normalizing these to approximate conditional probabilities:

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.03}{0.11} \approx 0.27 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.03 + 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.11} \approx 0.73 \]

Thus, the approximated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.73
}
```

These values indicate that based on the personality sketch, it is more likely that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
