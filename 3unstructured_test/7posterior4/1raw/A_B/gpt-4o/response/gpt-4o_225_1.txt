To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field (H), we need several pieces of information:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific data for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative and logical analysis to approximate these values.

### Analysis

1. **Business Administration:**

   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a relatively common graduate field. Let's assume it's moderately likely.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interests and personality traits such as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and focus on abstract concepts are not typically associated with a standard Business Administration profile. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is therefore relatively low.
   - **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Considering the low likelihood, the posterior probability of Adam being in Business Administration is lower than many other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than Business Administration but is directly related to Adam's interests.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Given the high likelihood and meaningful alignment of characteristics, the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is relatively high.

Based on the qualitative assessment:

\[ 
P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.1 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.8 
\]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the given information about Adam and typical characteristics of the fields. Precise calculation would require specific data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
