To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some information:

1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \): The initial probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numeric values for these, the following answers provide a conceptual estimation based on the information given:

\[
\{
  "business administration": "low, based on Adam's expressed interests and traits, which do not typically align with business administration disciplines",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "high, based on Adam's personality sketch, which aligns closely with interests in plants, animals, and nature"
\}
\]

If we were to estimate these probabilities based purely on Adam's personality and interests and not from a complete probabilistic standpoint, the responses might look something like this:

\[
\{
  "business administration": 0.1, \\
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
\}
\]

These values are qualitative estimates as exact probabilities would require precise prior probabilities and likelihoods that are not provided.
