To estimate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' Rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can make qualitative judgments based on the description given.

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
- **Business Administration**: The interest in nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, and animals doesn't strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration students. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business administration}) \) would be relatively low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The given traits align exceptionally well with this field, making \( P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) high.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)
We assume these priors based on general knowledge:
- **Business Administration**: It's a common field, so \( P(H_{business administration}) \) might be moderate.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is less common, so \( P(H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) might be lower.

### Evidence Probability \( P(E) \)
The evidence \( P(E) \) is the same for both and cancels out when comparing the two probabilities directly.

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)
Given that:
- The alignment of Adam’s characteristics with agricultural and veterinary science is strong.
- These characteristics don’t align as well with business administration.

We assign higher confidence to Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Without specific numbers, we can provide qualitative values representing this judgment.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note that these values are qualitative judgments and could vary with more specific data on the priors and likelihoods.
