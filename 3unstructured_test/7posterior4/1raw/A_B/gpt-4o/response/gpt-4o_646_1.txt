Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \). Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will only comment on the relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Based on Adam's traits and interests:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals
- High intelligence, solving puzzles
- Strong empathy and warm heart
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work

Adam's characteristics strongly align with someone likely to pursue a field related to nature, animals, and science, like agricultural and veterinary science, rather than business administration.

Given these qualitative observations, we can make a reasonable assumption about the comparative likelihood:

For "business administration", the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively low because the personality traits do not specifically align with typical traits for business administration, which might focus more on management, finance, and economics.

For "agricultural and veterinary science", the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be relatively high because Adam's traits such as love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation of hard work align well with this field.

With these qualitative assessments, the specific posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

These values are an illustrative assessment based on the described personality traits and are not derived from exact numerical data. They show the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field based on the traits given.
