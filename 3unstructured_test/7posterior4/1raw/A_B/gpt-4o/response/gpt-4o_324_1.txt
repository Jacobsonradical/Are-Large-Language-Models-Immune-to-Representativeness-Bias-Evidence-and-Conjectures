To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to take into account not only the likelihood of E given H (\( P(E|H) \)) but also the prior probability of H (\( P(H) \)) and the overall probability of E (\( P(E) \)):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have exact prior probabilities or likelihood values, I will make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch \( E \).

Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy suggest a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science. His traits do not strongly suggest a fit for business administration.

To proceed, we assume the following:
- \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is higher due to the strong alignment with Adam's interests (e.g., agriculture and veterinary sciences account for a notable but not dominant proportion of graduate fields).
- \( P(H) \) for business administration is lower because there's a weaker alignment with Adam's personality traits.

We also assume:
- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high since the personality sketch aligns well with this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is lower.

For simplicity, let's assign high likelihood (0.70) to agricultural and veterinary science and low likelihood (0.10) to business administration and assume some hypothetical prior (base rate) probabilities for H given the sketch: 0.4 for agricultural and veterinary science and 0.10 for business administration.

Thus, the posterior probabilities will be estimated as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{agricultural}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.70 \cdot 0.40}{P(E)}
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{business}|E) &= \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \\
&= \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.10}{P(E)}
\end{align*}
\]

The term \( P(E) \) normalizes these probabilities and is not strictly necessary for comparison, so can be inferred to be implicitly equal for comparison between hypotheses.

Thus, ratios:

\[
\frac{P(H_{agricultural}|E)}{P(H_{business}|E)} = \frac{0.28}{0.01} = 28 \Rightarrow P(H_{agricultural}|E) = 0.965, P(H_{business}|E) = 0.035
\]

Hence, the estimated result:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.965,
  "business administration": 0.035
}
