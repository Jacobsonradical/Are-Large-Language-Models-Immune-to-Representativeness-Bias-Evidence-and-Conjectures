To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for several factors including the prior probability of each field (which we will assume to be equal due to lack of specific data), the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field, and the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \) as the probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_{agri\_vet}) \) and \( P(H_{bus\_admin}) \) as the prior probabilities of each field.
- \( P(E) \) as the overall probability of the personality sketch.

With equal priors due to lack of specific initial data, we assume \( P(H_{agri\_vet}) = P(H_{bus\_admin}) = 0.5 \).

For the likelihoods:
- Given Adam's deep love of nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy, it is more likely for him to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Given the lack of direct traits typically associated with business administration, such as a focus on economics, management, or entrepreneurship, it is less likely but not impossible.

Let's assign:
- \( P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) = 0.9 \): High likelihood due to relevant traits.
- \( P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) = 0.1 \): Low likelihood due to less directly relevant traits.

We don't need to normalize against \( P(E) \) since the goal is to get relative probabilities.

Now applying Bayes' rule for each field:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri\_vet})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.45}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{bus\_admin}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \cdot P(H_{bus\_admin})}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05}{P(E)} \]

Considering \( P(E) \) cancels out for ratio comparison purposes, we get relative values:

\[ P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(H_{bus\_admin}|E) = 0.1 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```
