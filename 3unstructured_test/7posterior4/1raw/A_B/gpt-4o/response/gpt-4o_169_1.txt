To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information such as the prior probability of Adam choosing each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) being a match for each of those fields.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing evidence \( E \).

Given that we don't have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we need to make some reasonable assumptions:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Personality traits described, such as a deep love for animals and an appreciation for nature, align strongly with this field.
   - High probability \( P(E|H_{agriculture and veterinary science}) \).

2. Business Administration:
   - While intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant to this field, the personality traits of empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature may not align as strongly.
   - Moderately low probability \( P(E|H_{business administration}) \).

Making reasonable assumptions based on these alignments, let's assign subjective likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{agriculture and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(H_{agriculture and veterinary science}) = 0.2 \) (assuming graduate students are equally distributed across 5 broad fields on average)
- \( P(E|H_{business administration}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) can be approximated as a normalization factor but is not necessary for relative posterior computations across hypotheses since the same normalization applies to all.

Using these subjective likelihoods and priors:

\[ P(H_{agriculture and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agriculture and veterinary science}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business administration}) \cdot P(H_{business administration}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Now we need to normalize these probabilities so that their sum represents a relative measure out of 1 for these two fields:

Normalization factor \( N \) = \( 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.20 \)

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_{agriculture and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.20} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.20} = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
