To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior conditional probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Given: 
- E: Adam's personality sketch.
- Different fields (H): Business Administration, Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will use qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \( H_{BA} \): Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.
- \( H_{AVS} \): Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

**Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in Business Administration.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Likelihood of Adam’s personality and interests given he was in Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Likelihood of Adam’s personality and interests given he was in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Since Adam has a deep love for animals and nature, strong empathy, and a curiosity about plants, the likelihood of these traits fitting someone in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is much higher than it fitting someone in Business Administration.

Given this information, we qualitatively assess:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) << \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)

Assuming a neutral prior (i.e., each field is equally likely to start with):

- \( P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{AVS}) = 0.5 \)

Then:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) < 0.5
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) > 0.5

Without exact numbers, this qualitative assessment would yield:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

This reflects the higher probability that Adam is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, given his personality sketch and interests.
