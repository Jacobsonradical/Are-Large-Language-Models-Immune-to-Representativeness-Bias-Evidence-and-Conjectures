In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need both the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). However, since we lack specific prior data about the general distribution of students in these fields or detailed likelihoods, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the congruence of Adam's personality sketch with the fields in question.

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, interest in nature, and genuine curiosity about plants, it seems plausible that he could be in agricultural and veterinary science. In contrast, his traits seem less aligned with a business administration field, which traditionally emphasizes leadership, management, and organizational skills that may not directly coincide with his demonstrated interests and personality.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here are the suggested probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the higher likelihood of Adam's personality aligning with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given the available information.
