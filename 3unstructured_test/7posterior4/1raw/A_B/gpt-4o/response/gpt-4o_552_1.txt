To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps: 

1. Identify the prior probability \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis \(H\).
2. Identify the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
3. Compute the normalization factor \(P(E)\), the total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given that we don't have precise numerical values for each of these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the description of Adam's personality sketch.

### Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Generally, a smaller percentage of students are enrolled in this field compared to Business Administration.
- Business Administration: Traditionally, this field has a larger enrollment.

Assume:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.05 \] 
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.15 \]

### Likelihoods \(P(E|H)\):

Based on Adam's personality sketch:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work, the likelihood of this field fitting him is high.
  
\[P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.9\]

- Business Administration: His personality doesnâ€™t strongly suggest a clear fit for business; although he has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which can be beneficial in business, his deep love for animals and nature suggests a lesser fit.
  
\[P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2\]

### Compute Posterior Probability \(P(H|E)\):

To compute the posterior, we also need the total probability of the evidence \(P(E)\), which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) + P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) + \text{other terms} \]

For simplicity (ignoring other terms since we don't have their values and they affect both terms equally):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.05) + (0.2 \cdot 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.045 + 0.03 = 0.075 \]

### Final Posterior Probabilities:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.075} \approx 0.6 \]

- **Business Administration:**

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.075} \approx 0.4 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the given information. For precise numerical probabilities, specific prior and likelihood values from relevant statistical studies would be needed.
