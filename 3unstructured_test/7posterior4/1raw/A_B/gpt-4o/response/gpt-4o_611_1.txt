To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) if Adam is enrolled in the specific field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Given that we don't have specific empirical data to provide exact probabilities, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch and typical tendencies of students in those fields. Let's make educated guesses based on Adam's traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, since Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Let's assume it's relatively higher for someone in the U.S.
  
2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Lower, since the traits such as a love for animals and nature are less directly relevant.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, so we assume it's fairly high.

Given the assumptions:
- \( P(H)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(H)_{\text{Business Administration}} \approx 0.3 \)

And:
- \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration \( \approx 0.4 \)

Assuming \( P(E) \) is the same across all fields for normalization and does not affect the ratio, we then get:

\[
P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + \text{other fields}}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.3 + \text{other fields}}
\]

Since the "other fields" part affects both equally, we can compute the simplified proportional values without the need for exact normalization:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.66,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```

This reflects that based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is approximately twice as likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
