To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we utilize the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step overview of how this would be approached:

1. **Define \( P(E|H_i) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. 
   - **For agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine interest in nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work, it’s likely high.
   - **For business administration**: Adam's warm heart and empathy could apply, but his love for animals and nature is less relevant.
   
2. **Define \( P(H_i) \)**: The prior probability of each hypothesis. Without specific information, we might assume a rough equal likelihood but can reasonably infer popularity differences.
   - Enrollment rates in agricultural and veterinary sciences are generally lower than business administration in the U.S., so it's likely lower.
   
3. **Define \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of the evidence. It's a normalizing constant, which we can omit as long as we're comparing posteriors relatively.

### Assigning Likelihood Values:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: High compatibility with Adam’s traits, so let's assume \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \).
- **Business administration**: Moderate compatibility, given empathy, so let's assume \( P(E|H_2) = 0.3 \).

### Assigning Prior Values:
- Let's assume \( P(H_1) = 0.05 \) for agricultural and veterinary science (lower enrollment).
- Let's assume \( P(H_2) = 0.30 \) for business administration (higher enrollment).

### Calculating Posteriors (excluding normalizing constant):
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
  \( P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \)

- **Business administration**:
  \( P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.3 \cdot 0.30 = 0.09 \)

We can summarize the results as follows, keeping in mind these are relative and not normalized probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04,
  "business administration": 0.09
}
```
Please note these interpretations and values are estimations and can vary with more specific data. The actual computed values provide a rough relative comparison between the fields based on given traits.
