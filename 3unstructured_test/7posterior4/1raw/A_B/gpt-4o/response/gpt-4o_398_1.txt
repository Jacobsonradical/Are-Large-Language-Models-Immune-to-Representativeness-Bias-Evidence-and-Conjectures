To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of a hypothesis before observing the evidence.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of the evidence across all possible fields.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make informed guesses based on the details given.

1. **Business Administration (H₁)**:
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H₁) \): Let's assume it's a common field, so the prior might be moderate.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H₁) \): Adam’s traits (genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work) do not strongly align with typical traits needed for business administration. Hence, this likelihood is probably low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H₂)**:
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H₂) \): Let's assume it has a lower base rate among graduate fields compared to business.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H₂) \): Adam’s traits strongly align with this field. Genuine curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work directly pertain to agricultural and veterinary science. Hence, this likelihood would be high.

Given that the exact numbers aren’t available, our estimates might be largely qualitative.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- The likelihood of Adam fitting into agricultural and veterinary science (given his personality sketch) seems significantly higher than business administration.
- Given the lack of exact priors and likelihoods, these are educated guesses based on the information provided.
