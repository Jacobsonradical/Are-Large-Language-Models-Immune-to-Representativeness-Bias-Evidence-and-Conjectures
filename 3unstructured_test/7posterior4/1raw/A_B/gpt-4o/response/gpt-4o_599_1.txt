To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the nature of the information, let's make some educated guesses for these probabilities:

1. **Likelihood ( \( P(E|H) \) ):
   - For business administration: Given Adam's personality sketch emphasizing a love for nature, animals, and empathy, these traits are less characteristic of typical business administration students.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: These traits align well with students in this field, who often have a deep interest in nature, animals, and related study areas.

2. **Prior Probability ( \( P(H) \) ):
   - Prior probabilities of Adam being in either field might be initially equal without specific domain knowledge, but we might assume agricultural and veterinary science is more aligned with his traits.

3. **Marginal Probability ( \( P(E) \) ):
   - This is a normalization factor and is not needed explicitly as we are not required to ensure the probabilities sum to 1.

Given these considerations, let’s assume the following rough numbers for illustrative purposes (they are not based on actual data and are speculative):

- **P(E|H)**:
  - For business administration: \(0.1\)
  - For agricultural and veterinary science: \(0.9\)

- **P(H)**:
  - For business administration: \(0.2\)
  - For agricultural and veterinary science: \(0.8\)

We can use Bayes' Rule now:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx 0.1 \times 0.2 / P(E) \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \approx 0.9 \times 0.8 / P(E) \]

For simplicity, we calculate the unnormalized values:

- Unnormalized \( P(H_{BA}|E) \): \(0.02\)
- Unnormalized \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \): \(0.72\)

Given that these are unnormalized values, it’s clear \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \) is significantly higher than \( P(H_{BA}|E) \). The posterior probabilities therefore suggest that Adam is much more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus:

{
  "business administration": "0.02",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.72"
}
