To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields (which is often challenging to determine precisely without comprehensive data).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that comprehensive data for prior probabilities and evidence probabilities are typically not provided in general questions, these probabilities have to be estimated based on the information from the personality sketch \( E \).

Since precise data is unavailable, let's make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and heuristic judgment from the personality sketch provided:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H_{bus}) \): Prior probability for business administration - let's assume a generic value, say 0.1 (10%).
   - \( P(E|H_{bus}) \): Likelihood for business administration. The personality traits mentioned in \( E \) (e.g., love for nature, puzzles, animals) do not particularly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration. Thus, let's assume a low value, say 0.01 (1%).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H_{agvet}) \): Prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science - let's assume a generic value, say 0.05 (5%).
   - \( P(E|H_{agvet}) \): Likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science. The personality traits mentioned in \( E \) (e.g., curiosity about nature, love for animals) strongly align with this field. Thus, let's assume a higher value, say 0.5 (50%).

To find \( P(E) \), the evidence, we need to sum over all the possible fields, but since we're only comparing these two fields:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) + P(E|H_{agvet}) \cdot P(H_{agvet}) \]

Now let's calculate:

\[ P(E) \approx (0.01 \cdot 0.1) + (0.5 \cdot 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.001 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.026 \]

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.026} \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) \approx \frac{0.001}{0.026} \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) \approx 0.038 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agvet}) \cdot P(H_{agvet})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.05}{0.026} \]
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) \approx \frac{0.025}{0.026} \]
\[ P(H_{agvet}|E) \approx 0.962 \]

Here is the final formatted answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.038,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.962
}
