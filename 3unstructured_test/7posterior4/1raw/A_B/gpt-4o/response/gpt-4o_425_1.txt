To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. Bayes' rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have exact numerical values for these elements, we can still form qualitative estimates based on the given information about Adam and general assumptions about the fields.

**Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
We'll assume that the prior probabilities are not known precisely but might be roughly similar for broad fields of study, as we're not given specific reasons to favor one field over another in the prior. Let's just assume that \( P(H) \) is the same for each field due to lack of specific data. This simplifies our formula to focus more on \( P(E|H) \).

**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, loves animals, and appreciates hard work.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.

Let's make qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - High relevance: His love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field.
    - Empathy and appreciation for hard work also fit well.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and vet science}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Moderate relevance: Abstract thinking and intelligence are useful, but fewer direct connections to empathy for animals or nature.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is lower.

Now, we can qualitatively assign higher and lower probabilities based on these insights:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values are subjective but reasonable given the description. For precise probabilities, we would need more specific data about the distributions in the corresponding populations and the priors.
