To apply Bayes' rule in this context, we need to identify the components:

- **Hypotheses (H)**: Here the two hypotheses are "Adam was enrolled in business administration" and "Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science."
- **Evidence (E)**: The personality sketch of Adam.
- **Prior probabilities (P(H))**: These are the probabilities that any given graduate student is enrolled in each of the fields, before knowing Adam's personality sketch. Let's denote these priors as P(business administration) and P(agricultural and veterinary science).
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.

Bayes' rule is written as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical priors or likelihoods, we can deduce the relative likelihoods based on the given description using reasoning.

1. **P(E|business administration)**: The traits mentioned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, interest in puzzles, empathy) are less typically associated with business administration. Thus, the likelihood P(E|business administration) should be relatively low.

2. **P(E|agricultural and veterinary science)**: Adam's personality sketch (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy) strongly aligns with what we might expect in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Thus, the likelihood P(E|agricultural and veterinary science) should be relatively high.

Given these considerations, we'll assume:
\[ \frac{P(E|agricultural and veterinary science)}{P(E|business administration)} >> 1 \]

For a more precise numerical approach, if we don't have actual data but want to make an educated guess based on the alignment of personality traits with fields, we might assign relative higher probabilities.

Let's assume a general thought process representation rather than exact probability numbers:

{
  "business administration": 0.1, 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

This suggests that it's far more likely that Adam would be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given his personality sketch.
