To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know several pieces of information, including the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of observing the evidence given that Adam is in each field (\( P(E|H) \)), as well as the overall probability of the evidence (\( P(E) \)). 

Since we don't have actual numerical values for these probabilities, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the given information.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We substitute into Bayes' rule using our qualitative assessments:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's interest and empathy towards animals and nature, it is more probable that he might be enrolled in fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, there is no direct information suggesting an interest in business administration.
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adamâ€™s personality sketch heavily aligns with qualities that might be found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science: curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation of hard work. These traits are less indicative of someone studying business administration, where we might expect traits pointing towards economic interest, leadership, and strategic thinking.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is a normalizing constant and since we are considering relative posterior probabilities, we can focus on the likelihoods and priors without computing the exact marginal probability.

By qualitatively assessing these probabilities, we get:

\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{business administration}) P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)}
\]

Considering Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood \( P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) and prior \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) would qualitatively be high, leading to a relatively high posterior probability for this hypothesis. For business administration, both the prior and likelihood would qualitatively be low.

Therefore, based on qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",  // These values are illustrative
  "business administration": "0.2"             // and do not sum to 1 given the unknown priors
}
```

These values are subject to actual data input and are only reflective based on qualitative judgments from the descriptions provided.
