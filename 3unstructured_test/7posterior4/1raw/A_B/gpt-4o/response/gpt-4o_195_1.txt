Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider three components: 

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in a specific field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Given the personality sketch, we can intuitively estimate the likelihoods and priors based on typical characteristics associated with students in each field.

### Estimations

1. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**
   - Business Administration students typically focus on management, analytics, economics, and leadership. While empathy and high intelligence are relevant here, curiosity about nature and love for animals are less common.
   - **Estimated P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Low to Moderate

2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - This field involves a direct interaction with plants, animals, and nature, matching Adamâ€™s interests and traits much more closely.
   - **Estimated P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High

3. **P(H) for each field**
   - Assuming there is no initial bias towards any specific field, we assume a uniform prior. However, data on the relative popularity of each field might adjust these priors in a practical scenario.

4. **P(E)**
   - Normalizing constant across all fields, we don't need the exact value, as we are only computing comparative posterior probabilities.

### Simplified Bayesian Computation

Assume:
- \( P(E|H_{bus}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{agVet}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(H_{bus}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_{agVet}) \approx 0.5 \)

Since we are comparing the two specific fields, \( P(E) \) will normalize:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

### Posterior Probabilities
- \( P(H_{bus}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{agVet}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \)

The exact posterior probabilities will be normalized proportional to these values:

\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(H_{agVet}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.889 \]

### Result

  "business administration": 0.111,
