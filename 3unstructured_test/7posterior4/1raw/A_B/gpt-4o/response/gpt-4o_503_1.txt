To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam chose a particular field given his personality.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having his personality characteristics if he were in that particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a student is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of a student having Adam's personality characteristics. 

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will make qualitative assessments. 

### Assumptions:
1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Individuals in business administration are less likely to exhibit strong empathy, a love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, compared to fields like agricultural and veterinary sciences.
    - \( P(H_{business}) \): This field is quite common among graduate students.
  
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(E|H_{agriculture/veterinary}) \): Individuals in this field are more likely to match Adam's characteristics, such as a love for animals and curiosity about nature.
    - \( P(H_{agriculture/veterinary}) \): This field is less common than business administration, but still has a significant number of graduate students.

By these assessments, we can reason that \( P(E|H_{agriculture/veterinary}) \) is much higher compared to \( P(E|H_{business}) \), leading to a higher posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science.

### Likely Values:
Without concrete numerical values, estimates are qualitative. Here's a reasonable approximation:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
