To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), priors (\( P(H) \)), and the evidence (\( P(E) \)).

Given the information about Adam's personality sketch, we can subjectively estimate the likelihoods and priors to answer this question. For simplicity, let's assume the following:

### Likelihoods
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given that he is enrolled in business administration. This is likely to be lower because his interests and traits don’t align strongly with typical business administration students.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The probability of Adam’s characteristics given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is higher since his love for nature, plants, and animals fits well with this field.

### Priors
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): The prior probability that someone is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this to be moderate.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): The prior probability that someone is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this to be lower because fewer students go into this specialized field.

### Evidence
The evidence \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, so it cancels out in our calculations and doesn't need to be precisely determined.

Given this, here’s a plausible set of values:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, say 0.1
    - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Moderate, say 0.3
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, say 0.7
    - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Lower, say 0.2

Now let's compute \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} 
\]
Using assumed values:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} 
\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} 
\]
Using assumed values:
\[ 
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.14}{P(E)} 
\]

Given that the denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for both, the relative probabilities can be compared directly, but they are unnormalized. For a quick, conditional comparison:

\[ 
\text{business administration}: \frac{0.03}{P(E)} 
\]
\[ 
\text{agricultural and veterinary science}: \frac{0.14}{P(E)} 
\]

Therefore, the values can now be simplified to:

\[ 
P(H|E) \propto 0.03 \text{ for business administration} 
\]
\[ 
P(H|E) \propto 0.14 \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science} 
\]

Normalizing is unnecessary as other fields contribute to \( P(E) \).

### Final Approximation

Given these calculations, the relative conditional probabilities can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14
}
```

This indicates that, based on his personality, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
