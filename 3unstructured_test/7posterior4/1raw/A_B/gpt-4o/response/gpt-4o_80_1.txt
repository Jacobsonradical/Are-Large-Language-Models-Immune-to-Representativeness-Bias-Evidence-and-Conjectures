Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior conditional probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

To calculate \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need information on prior probabilities \( P(H) \), which would ideally come from domain-specific data such as the proportion of graduate students enrolled in each field. Additionally, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) require an understanding of how likely it is for someone with Adam's described traits to be in each field.

Given the sketch's characteristics, we can make qualitative assessments:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, appreciation for hard work in nature, and empathy correlate strongly with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
- These traits are less stereotypically associated with business administration, which might emphasize competitiveness, leadership, and business acumen.

For illustrative purposes, let's assign intuitive likelihoods without actual empirical data:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) — Given Adam's traits, it's quite likely he fits this field.
- Business administration: \( P(E|H) = 0.2 \) — Given Adam's traits, it's less likely but still possible.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity (as actual data is not provided):

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.5 \]

The denominator \( P(E) \) normalizes the probabilities. Since we're only comparing two fields:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule separately for each field:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
