Bayes' rule can be used to compute the posterior probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. The rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide you with specific numerical values, we'd need the probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Since those values are not provided, I'll qualitatively reason through the problem instead.

First, let's break down what we know:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He loves animals.
- He is empathetic and has a warm heart.
- He is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's hypothesize about the fields in question:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typically involves skills such as leadership, management, strategic thinking, finance, and operations.
   - While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be highly relevant, the empathy and love for nature and animals are not typically core aspects of this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Directly relates to a love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Empathy and a warm heart are crucial attributes for individuals working with animals.
   - Intelligence and the ability to understand abstract concepts would be valuable in any scientific field.
   - An appreciation for hard work and dedication is often necessary in these science fields.

Given these qualitative assessments, Adam's personality traits align much more strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Business Administration.

Thus, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities can be qualitatively inferred as follows:
 
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
} 

Please note these are estimative values based on the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality and the field requirements. Actual values would need more data on the prior probabilities and likelihoods.
