To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) given the provided personality sketch \( E \) of Adam using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given Adam was in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since we don't have access to exact empirical data (such as typical distributions for graduate students' interests across different fields), we'll make educated estimates based on the given sketch. We can primarily base \( P(E|H) \) on how well the personality matches the assumed traits characteristic of students in each field.

Let's estimate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Adam’s empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.
    - High estimate for \( P(E|H) \).

2. **Business Administration:**
    - Business administration typically requires strategic thinking and may not perfectly align with Adam’s described empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. 
    - Lower estimate for \( P(E|H) \).

Given these considerations:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(( P(H) )**: Without specific data, assume equal priors for simplicity.
   
2. **Likelihoods \(( P(E|H) )**:
    - "Agricultural and veterinary science" has a higher likelihood due to alignment with Adam's characteristics.
    - "Business administration" has a lower likelihood due to lesser alignment.

Here are the educated estimates, recognizing they are without exact empirical data:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \\
& P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.5 \\
& P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \\
& P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.5 \\
& P(E) \text{ is derived from the above with normalization.}
\end{aligned}
\]

Assuming normalization so that the sum of probabilities for these hypotheses is relative based on the provided context:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Normalized terms would include:}
& P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + \\
& P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) 
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, our posterior computations yield:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5] = 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5] = 0.2
}
```

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These posterior probabilities are relative to the context and assumptions made within this scenario.
