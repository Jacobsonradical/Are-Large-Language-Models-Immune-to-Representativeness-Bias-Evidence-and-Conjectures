To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the distribution of graduate fields of specialization, the likelihood of the personality traits given the fields, and the prior probabilities of each field.

Bayes’ rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume we have rough estimates:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being in a given field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of having Adam's personality traits given the field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality traits (a normalization factor).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \): ** Estimate that about 7% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): ** High, given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy. Let's assume it’s 0.8.
- **Normalization factor \( P(E) \): ** Estimate based on the prevalence and the likelihoods across all possible fields.

### Business Administration:
- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \): ** Estimate that about 20% of graduate students are in business administration.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): ** Lower, given Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration. Let’s assume it’s 0.2.
- **Normalization factor \( P(E) \): ** As above, it should be the combined likelihood of Adam's personality across all fields.

To simplify the calculations since we're focusing on a rough estimate based on the qualitative data:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Let's denote \( K \) as the normalization constant. We can consider the proportionate values since the total is not supposed to be 1.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.07}{K} \approx 0.056 \),
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \times 0.20}{K} \approx 0.040 \)
}

For simplicity, the exact normalization constant \( K \) is ignored, as it would equally proportionalize both values. Thus, we can directly compare:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.056,
  "business administration": 0.040
}
```

These values illustrate that given the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
