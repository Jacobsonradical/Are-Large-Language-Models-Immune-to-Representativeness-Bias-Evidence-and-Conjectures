Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field, given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Given that we don't have specific data on prior probabilities or precise likelihood values, I'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on common sense and typical distributions of students within these fields. 

1. **For Business Administration**:
   - The characteristics of Adam (nature curiosity, love for animals, empathy, etc.) are not typically aligned with business administration, which often emphasizes skills like analysis of financial data, management, etc.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is relatively low.

2. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - The characteristics of Adam are highly aligned with this field. Curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals correlate strongly with a degree like this.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{agr_vet}) \) is relatively high.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) (i.e., we assume there is an equal prior probability that Adam could be in any field without additional information):

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{business}|E) & \approx \frac{\text{low likelihood}}{\text{some normalization factor}} \approx 0.1 \\
P(H_{agr_vet}|E) & \approx \frac{\text{high likelihood}}{\text{same normalization factor}} \approx 0.7 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the resulting posterior probabilities could be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

Please note, these values are illustrative and based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise numeric data.
