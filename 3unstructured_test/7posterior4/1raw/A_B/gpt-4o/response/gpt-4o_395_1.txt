To compute posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the probability of E given H (\( P(E|H) \)), the prior probability of H (\( P(H) \)), and the total probability of E (\( P(E) \)). The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don’t have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can make educated estimates based on the given information and assumptions. Let’s break it down:

1. **Business Administration**

   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: There's a general sense that Business Administration is a common field of study.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Although Business Administration students may have empathy and understanding of hard work, it’s less likely they would have strong interests in nature, plants, and animals. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than Business Administration but more aligned with Adam’s interests.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals strongly align with this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, let’s assign some approximate probabilities.

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Given that Adam's profile fits less with this field)
 
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \) (Since it is less common)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (Given that Adam's profile fits well with this field)

Let's also estimate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence (Adam's profile), considering all possible fields.

Since we are only comparing the two fields and know the prior probabilities within that limited context:

\[
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}})
\]
\[
P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) = 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.07
\]

Now, use Bayes’ rule:

For **Business Administration**:
\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.3)}{0.07} = \frac{0.03}{0.07} \approx 0.4286
\]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[
P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.05)}{0.07} = \frac{0.04}{0.07} \approx 0.5714
\]

The posterior probabilities tell us how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in each field given his traits:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.4286,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5714
}
```

These values provide a comparative likelihood ratio based on the given personality sketch, despite not having precise quantitative data.
