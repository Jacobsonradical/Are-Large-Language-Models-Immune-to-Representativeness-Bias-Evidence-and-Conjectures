To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can provide qualitative assessments based on the information given.

Given Adam's interests and traits mentioned in the personality sketch \( E \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likely to have a high \( P(E|H) \) because his interests in nature, plants, and animals align well with this field.
   - Generally, this field might have fewer students compared to fields like Business Administration, possibly leading to moderate \( P(H) \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likely to have a low \( P(E|H) \) because his personality and interests (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not align as well with typical characteristics of this field.
   - This field generally has a high number of students, leading to a high \( P(H) \) in general, but this prior is not very informative without quantitative values.

Based on qualitative reasoning, we can infer that:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \gg P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

This would give:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) > P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \]

Given the qualitative nature and our lack of exact numerical values, we need to assign values between 0 and 1 that fit these qualitative assessments.

Let's assign:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values reflect that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration, based on his personality sketch.
