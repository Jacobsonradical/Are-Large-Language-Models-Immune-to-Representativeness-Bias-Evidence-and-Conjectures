To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we would theoretically need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), which represent how likely Adam's personality sketch \(E\) is given each field \(H\). However, since the priors and likelihoods are not provided explicitly, I will make a reasoned qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Bayes' Rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given Adam's described interests and characteristics, it is very unlikely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program because the traits listed (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals) align more closely with fields related to understanding and interacting with the natural world.

By contrast, agricultural and veterinary science seems to align well with Adam's personality traits. His curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant to this field.

Given these considerations, I would assign a higher posterior probability to agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, although without exact figures for the prior distributions and specific likelihood values, these values are qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

These values indicate that while it's not impossible for Adam to be in business administration, it is much more probable that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
