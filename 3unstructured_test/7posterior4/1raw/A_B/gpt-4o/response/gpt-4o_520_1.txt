To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional pieces of information that aren't provided directly within the problem statement. These include:

1. The prior probability P(H) for each hypothesis H. This could be influenced by the general distribution of graduate students among different fields.
2. The likelihood P(E|H), which is how likely we would observe the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given that Adam is in each possible field of study.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we can compare the likelihoods and priors relative to each other, as the denominator P(E) is the same for all hypotheses and cancels out when calculating ratios.

Since we don't have specific numbers, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the given sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood P(E|H) is high in this field.

2. **Business Administration:** This field typically doesn't have a strong connection with the personality traits of curiosity about nature and a love for animals. Therefore, the likelihood P(E|H) might be lower.

We can use qualitative estimates instead of precise numerical values. Based on the provided personality sketch and the assumed reasonableness:

\[ P(E|H_{agriculture}) \text{ is quite high} \]
\[ P(E|H_{business}) \text{ is much lower} \]

Given these qualitative estimates, let's assign reasonable probabilities:
- Prior P(H) for each field: Assuming no bias in initial distributions, let's assign an equal baseline prior probability for simplicity. However, in practice, the prior should reflect the actual distribution of graduate students across fields.

\[ P(H_{agriculture}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(H_{business}) = 0.2 \]

For conditional probabilities based on the sketch:
\[ P(E|H_{agriculture}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \]

Normalizing to combine priors and likelihoods:

Let's compute unnormalized posteriors:
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.16 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

After normalization (not adding up to 1 but focused relatively):
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
\]

These values reflect the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods given Adam's personality traits.
