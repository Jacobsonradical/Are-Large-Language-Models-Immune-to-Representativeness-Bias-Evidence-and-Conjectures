To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in the absence of specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we can only qualitatively assess the likelihood in a subjective manner based on the provided personality sketch \( E \). For simplicity, let's make reasonable qualitative assumptions about \( P(E|H) \) based on the given information, and assume \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \) are uniform across all fields since these priors are not provided.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals do not strongly correlate with typical traits for business administration students, who might be more interested in commercial, organizational, and economic aspects.
   - Therefore, we might subjectively assess \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) as being relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's traits align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication are strongly associated with this field.
   - Thus, we might subjectively assess \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) as being relatively high.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities are more likely as follows:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) >> P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \]

To assign specific values, we can make reasonable qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These subjective values reflect the stronger match between Adam's personality sketch and the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
