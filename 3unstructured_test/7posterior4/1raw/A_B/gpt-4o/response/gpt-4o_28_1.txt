To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis, \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Due to Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) would be high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Given the emphasis on empathy, intelligence, and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{business}) \) would be relatively lower compared to agricultural sciences because business administration is less directly connected to these traits.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) and \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) as probabilities related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(H_{business}) \) and \( P(E|H_{business}) \) as probabilities related to Business Administration.

Given this qualitative analysis, we assume:
1. The prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( P(H_{agricultural}) \)) is moderately common.
2. The prior probability for Business Administration (\( P(H_{business}) \)) is more common among graduate fields generally but less indicated by Adam's personality.

We'll assume a baseline for simplicity:
- \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.1 \) (10% of students might be in this field)
- \( P(H_{business}) = 0.3 \) (30% of students might be in this field)
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 \) (80% likely given Adam's traits fit well with this field)
- \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \) (10% likely given Adam's traits don't strongly match)

Using Bayes' rule, we compute:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agricultural})P(H_{agricultural}) \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business})P(H_{business}) \]

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and acts as a normalizing factor, we can focus on the numerator:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) \propto 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.03 \]

These normalized can be approximated as:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = 0.08 / (0.08 + 0.03) = \frac{8}{11} \approx 0.727 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = 0.03 / (0.08 + 0.03) = \frac{3}{11} \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.727",
  "business administration": "0.273"
}
