Bayes' rule can be used to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. For the purposes of this calculation, we would need:

1. \( P(H) \): Prior probabilities of Adam being in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given the nature of the question and without specific numerical data, we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam’s personality sketch (E).

### Steps
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume the base rate of graduate students in each of these fields is fairly uniform, but not necessarily equal. However, it would be reasonable to assume that agricultural and veterinary science might be less common than business administration.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, these traits strongly align with this field.
   - For business administration: These traits do not strongly align with typical attributes like financial acumen or organizational leadership required for business administration, though empathy and intelligence are somewhat relevant.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - Given that we do not have the distribution of all possible fields, we’ll qualitatively assume this to be a normalization constant for now.

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

Let's initialize with qualitative assessments.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (assuming it's less common)
- \( P(E|H) \) is high since Adam’s traits fit this field well: 0.8 (high alignment).

#### Business Administration
- \( P(H) \approx 0.7 \) (more common)
- \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low since Adam’s traits do not strongly fit: 0.2.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We won't calculate \( P(E) \) explicitly but focus on relative magnitudes for qualitative assessment.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

#### Business Administration
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Given these proportions, we normalize them:
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} = \frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.14} \approx 0.63 \]
\[ P(H|E) \text{ for Business Administration} = \frac{0.14}{0.24 + 0.14} \approx 0.37 \]

However, it is important to stress these numbers are reliant on subjective priors and likelihoods, and without actual data, this is a qualitative estimate.

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.63",
  "business administration": "0.37"
}
```
