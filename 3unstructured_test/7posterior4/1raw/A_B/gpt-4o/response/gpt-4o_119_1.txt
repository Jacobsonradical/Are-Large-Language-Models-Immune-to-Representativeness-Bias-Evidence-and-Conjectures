To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field (which represent how likely it is for a random graduate student to be in that field) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) (how likely Adam's personality sketch is given each field).

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities, let's make reasonable assumptions:

1. **Priors**:
   - The prior probability that a graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is \( P(\text{Ag}) \).
   - The prior probability that a graduate student is in business administration is \( P(\text{Bus}) \).

For simplicity, let’s assume that the prior probabilities are approximately equal (you can adjust these based on actual data if available). We can then estimate these priors:
   \[
   P(\text{Ag}) \approx 0.05 \quad \text{(assuming smaller enrollments in specialized fields)},
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Bus}) \approx 0.10 \quad \text{(generally more students in business administration)}.
   \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood of the personality sketch given agricultural and veterinary science:
     \[
     P(E | \text{Ag}) \approx 0.9 \quad \text{(due to Adam's love for nature, animals, and dedication)}.
     \]
   - The likelihood of the personality sketch given business administration:
     \[
     P(E | \text{Bus}) \approx 0.2 \quad \text{(due to the focus on empathy, high intelligence, less directly tied to nature)}.
     \]

3. **Bayes' Rule**:
   Bayes' rule states:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}.
   \]

Since \( P(E) \) (the probability of Adam's personality sketch) is the same for both fields, we can compare the numerator of Bayes’ rule for each field and then normalize if required.

\[
P(\text{Ag} | E) \propto P(E|\text{Ag}) \cdot P(\text{Ag}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045,
\]
\[
P(\text{Bus} | E) \propto P(E|\text{Bus}) \cdot P(\text{Bus}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.10 = 0.02.
\]

Normalizing these to ensure they are probabilities (if needed):
\[
P(\text{Ag} | E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.02} \approx 0.69, \quad P(\text{Bus} | E) = \frac{0.02}{0.045 + 0.02} \approx 0.31.
\]

However, as you requested not necessarily for them to sum to 1, we report these values directly.

**Final Answer**:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.69,
  "business administration": 0.31
}
\]
