To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

For this scenario, we would need actual data to plug into these equations, which we don't have. However, we can make subjective estimates based on the given information.

### Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \): How likely is Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration?
  * Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not typical traits strongly associated with business administration.
  * Let's assign a low probability, for example, 0.1.

- \( P(H_{bus\_admin}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration.
  * Business administration is a fairly common graduate field.
  * Let's assume the prior is 0.2.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \): How likely is Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science?
  * Adam's curiosity about nature, love for plants, and animals align well with this field.
  * Let's assign a high probability, for example, 0.8.

- \( P(H_{agri\_vet}) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
  * Agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field, less common than business administration.
  * Let's assume the prior is 0.05.

### Calculations:

The denominator \( P(E) \) is difficult to determine without more data, but since we're looking at ratios, we don't need the exact value as long as we are consistent:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \cdot P(H_{bus\_admin}) + P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri\_vet}) + \text{others} \]

However, we can calculate proportional values instead:

#### Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{bus\_admin}|E) \propto P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \cdot P(H_{bus\_admin}) \]
\[ P(H_{bus\_admin}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri\_vet}) \]
\[ P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

### Result:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04
}
```

These values represent the relative strength of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, given his personality sketch.
