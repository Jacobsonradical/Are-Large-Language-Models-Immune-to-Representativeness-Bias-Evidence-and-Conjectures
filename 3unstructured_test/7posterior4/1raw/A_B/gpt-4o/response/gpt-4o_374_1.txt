To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider:

1. The prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis \( P(E|H) \).
3. The evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these components, we need to reason qualitatively due to the personality sketch (E) provided.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of Adam studying in the given fields. Here's how:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - The evidence suggests Adam is genuinely curious about nature, plants, and animals. Such interests are less likely associated with Business Administration.
   - Empathy and puzzle-solving can be useful in Business, but the focus on nature and animals is not aligning with typical Business Administration interests.
   - Therefore, \( P(E| \text{Business Administration}) \) would be relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - The evidence strongly aligns with Agricultural and Veterinary Science as this field involves nature, plants, and deep love for animals.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well too given this field often requires research and problem solving.
   - Therefore, \( P(E| \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \) would be relatively high.

Thus, while we can't provide exact numerical probabilities without additional data, we can provide qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, suggesting a much higher probability of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.
