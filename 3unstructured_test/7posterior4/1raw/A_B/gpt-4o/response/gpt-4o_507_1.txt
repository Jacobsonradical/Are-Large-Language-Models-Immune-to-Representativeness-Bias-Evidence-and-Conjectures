To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' Rule, we need:

1. The prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, P(H).
2. The likelihood of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, P(E|H).
3. The marginal likelihood of the evidence, P(E), which is the sum of the likelihoods for all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions:
- Given the personality sketch, we can make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods.
- We do not have exact priors, so we'll assume the prior probabilities P(H) are equal unless specified otherwise.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
    - **Prior Probability, P(H1)**: Assume uniform if no other info, say 0.5 since it's highly relevant to his personality sketch.
    - **Likelihood, P(E|H1)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals), the probability is high, say 0.9.

2. **Business Administration (H2)**:
    - **Prior Probability, P(H2)**: Assume uniform if no other info, say 0.5.
    - **Likelihood, P(E|H2)**: Given Adam's traits, this is less likely because they do not align well with business characteristics, say 0.3.

Given priors \(P(H1) = 0.5\) and \(P(H2) = 0.5\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.6 \]

Now compute the posteriors:

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

The values reflect the strong alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science over business administration based on the given personality sketch.
