To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, due to the lack of specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I need to provide qualitative estimates based on Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals align well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Likely moderate to high, as students with such traits often opt for these fields.
   - \( P(E) \): Higher relative relevance of this evidence to this field out of the general population.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate, as Adam's described interests and traits do not strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.
   - \( P(H) \): Likely moderate, as business administration is a common graduate field.
   - \( P(E) \): Lower relative relevance of this evidence to this field out of the general population.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

Note: These values are qualitative estimates intended to reflect the alignment of Adam's personality with the given fields. Accurate numerical probabilities would require actual statistical data.
