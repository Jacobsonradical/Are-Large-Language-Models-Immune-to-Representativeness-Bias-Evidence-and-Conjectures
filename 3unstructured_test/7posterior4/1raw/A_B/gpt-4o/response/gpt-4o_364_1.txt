To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we will rely on qualitative assessments based on the context provided in the personality sketch of Adam. These assessments are based on how closely his described traits fit the profile of typical students in each of the given fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(E|H)\): High. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy which aligns well with this field.
   - \(P(H)\): Moderate to high, as this field has many students, but not the majority.
   - \(P(E)\): We assume it's normalized over many possible fields.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(E|H)\): Low. While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work can be relevant, business administration students don't typically need a deep love for nature or animals.
   - \(P(H)\): High, given that business administration is a very common field among graduate students.
   - \(P(E)\): Similar normalization to above.

Given this qualitative assessment, letâ€™s assign reasonable values:

* For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, high \(P(E|H)\) and moderate \(P(H)\) lead us to relatively high \(P(H|E)\).
* For **Business Administration**, low \(P(E|H)\) despite high \(P(H)\) leads to lower \(P(H|E)\).

Based on this assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood that Adam was more inclined towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on his personality sketch.
