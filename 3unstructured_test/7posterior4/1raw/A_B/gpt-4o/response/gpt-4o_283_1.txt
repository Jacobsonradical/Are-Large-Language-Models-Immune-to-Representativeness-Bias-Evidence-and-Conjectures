To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since the problem statement does not provide these values explicitly, we have to make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions of students across graduate fields and the information provided in the personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll make some educated guesses:
1. Business Administration typically attracts individuals with a strong interest in business, management, and sometimes entrepreneurship. Adam's strong empathy and love for animals might not align as closely with the traits often associated with Business Administration.
2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science appears to have a strong alignment with Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.

Using these qualitative assessments, let's set our prior beliefs and likelihoods roughly to represent a stronger alignment with Agricultural and Veterinary Science (say, a higher likelihood than Business Administration but not mathematically precise without empirical data).

Here's a qualitative estimate:
- For Business Administration: Given the mismatch, let’s assume a lower likelihood.
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Given the strong alignment, a higher likelihood.

A qualitative assessment might look something like this:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These values are expressions of our educated guesses based on the information provided but should not be taken as definitive probabilities without actual prior and likelihood data.
