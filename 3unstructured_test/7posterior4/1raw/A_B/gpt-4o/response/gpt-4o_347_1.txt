To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we don't have actual numerical data for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, I'll provide a reasoned qualitative assessment. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work point strongly towards a field where these interests are central.
2. **Business Administration**: While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are relevant to business, Adam's specific interests seem less aligned with this field compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, I'd assign the following subjective posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These values indicate a higher likelihood for Adam specializing in Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration, given his personality sketch. Note that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on the provided information and may not be precise without actual data.
