In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities or likelihoods given for each field, I will make reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge about these fields in relation to his personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a popular field, so let's assume a prior probability of 0.2.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, business administration does not strongly align with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and preference for quiet, methodical work. Let's assume a likelihood of 0.05.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences is less common compared to business administration; let's assume a prior probability of 0.05.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This field aligns well with Adam's interest in nature, animals, and appreciation for dedication. Let's assume a likelihood of 0.6.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we need to compare relative probabilities for each field:
\[ P(business\ administration|E) \propto P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration) \]
\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) \propto P(E|agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) \cdot P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) \]

Calculating the proportions:
\[ P(business\ administration|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.2 = 0.01 \]
\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) \propto 0.6 \cdot 0.05 = 0.03 \]

Now we normalize these to get the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(business\ administration|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.03} = \frac{0.01}{0.04} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.01 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75 \]

Final values are:

\[ 
{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
\]
