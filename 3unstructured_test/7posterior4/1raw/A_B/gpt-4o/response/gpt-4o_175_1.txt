To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the basic formulation of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) before considering the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, in practice, we often don't have all the exact numbers to plug into Bayes' theorem straight away. We use our understanding of the situation to estimate the likelihoods and priors.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Love for animals.
- High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We need to assess how likely it is that someone with these characteristics would be in each of the given fields.

### Assessing Likelihoods:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- High relevance to nature, plants, and animals.
- Appreciates hard work, which is a significant part of agricultural and veterinary studies.
- High intelligence is crucial for the scientific and practical aspects of the field.

For **Business Administration**:
- Less direct relevance to nature, plants, and animals.
- The personality traits could fit someone in business administration, but there's no strong indicator.

### Estimations:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): High (Let's say 0.7)
- \( P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): Need an estimate, but let's assume itâ€™s moderate given a diverse range of graduate fields. (Let's say 0.1)

#### Business Administration:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \): Low to moderate (Let's say 0.2)
- \( P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \): Relatively common field of study. (Let's say 0.2)

### Normalizing with \( P(E) \):

While we do need \( P(E) \) to normalize, it's not crucial for comparing relative values. We'll focus on the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis:

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities (Normalized Relative Values):

To present these as conditional probabilities, we consider the ratios:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) &\propto \frac{0.07}{0.07 + 0.04} \approx 0.636 \\
P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) &\propto \frac{0.04}{0.07 + 0.04} \approx 0.364 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Since the request was for approximate values between 0 and 1, the results are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.364,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636
}
```

These numbers represent the estimated posterior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each respective field, given the personality sketch provided.
