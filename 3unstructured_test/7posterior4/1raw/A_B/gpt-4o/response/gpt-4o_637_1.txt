To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis (e.g., Adam was enrolled in either business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).
- \( E \) is the evidence (the personality sketch of Adam).

For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for being enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science are equal. We'll denote them both as \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) represents how likely we are to observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field. 

1. Business administration:
   - Not typically associated with a strong curiosity about nature and animals.
   - High intelligence and appreciation for dedication may fit but less relevant to his interest in nature and animals.

2. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - Strongly aligned with a curiosity about nature, plants, and animals.
   - High relevance given Adam’s love and empathy for animals.

Assuming these qualitative observations give us likelihood values that reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science than for business administration, let's assign some illustrative values:

- Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
- Let’s assume \( P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \)

With these assumptions, we can now compute the posterior probabilities:

For business administration:
\[
P(H_{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business administration}) \cdot P(H_{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[
P(H_{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)}
\]

Since the total probability \( P(E) \) is constant for the different fields and we are solely interested in the comparison, the posterior probabilities can be calculated as proportional quantities:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.45} = \frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.45}{0.05 + 0.45} = \frac{0.45}{0.5} = 0.9 \)
}

Therefore, based on the simplified quantitative assumptions and the qualitative analysis of Adam's personality sketch, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
