Given the nature of the problem and the need to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the following:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this scenario:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is in a specific field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam enrolling in a particular field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, which acts as a normalizing constant.

Though exact numeric probabilities for each component are not provided, we can reason qualitatively based on Adam's traits and the nature of the fields. To make estimates, we need to consider the alignment of Adam's interests and personality with each field.

### Reasoning
Let's list key points to help us make these estimates:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He is empathetic, warm-hearted, and appreciates hard work.
- He is highly intelligent with a knack for abstract concepts.
- He was a graduate student in 2021.

Considering these, here are the rough estimates for \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality does not strongly align with a typical business administration profile which often values traits like leadership, strategic decision-making, and an interest in corporate dynamics. While intelligence and hard work are relevant, the specific interest in nature and animals gives lower alignment.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality highly aligns with this field. His curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy directly relate.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This field is less common than business administration but highly relevant to Adam's traits.

### Estimates
Without exact priors and relying on qualitative reasoning, we might make these approximate calculations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the much higher alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given the provided information. However, precise computation requires actual data on priors and likelihoods, which is not provided in this scenario.
