To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' rule, we need to define the necessary components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (the evidence) which normalizes the posterior probabilities.

To simplify, we will make some assumptions:
1. Priors, \( P(H) \): Assume equal priors for simplicity, meaning we believe each field of study is equally likely before considering Adam's personality.
2. Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \): Based on Adam's personality traits, we will estimate these values subjectively.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we infer that he has a strong interest in nature and animals, high intelligence, warmth, and empathy, and an appreciation for hard work and the solving of puzzles. Such personality traits are more likely to steer him towards fields connected with nature and animals.

### Estimations

#### Business Administration
- \[ P(E|H) \]: Business administration typically requires analytical and strategic thinking, but doesn't specifically align with Adam's love for nature, animals, or puzzles. Thus, the likelihood is low.
- \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \[ P(E|H) \]: This field strongly aligns with Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and hard work. Thus, the likelihood is high.
- \[ P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \]

With equal priors:
- \[ P(H)_{\text{business administration}} = P(H)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = 0.5 \]

We do not need to compute \( P(E) \) as it is the same denominator in our probabilistic comparisons.

Putting it all together:
\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

However, because we were asked for results within a bounded answer and only to hypothesize two fields, this becomes straightforward.

### Answer

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This simplified estimate emphasizes that based on the provided personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.
