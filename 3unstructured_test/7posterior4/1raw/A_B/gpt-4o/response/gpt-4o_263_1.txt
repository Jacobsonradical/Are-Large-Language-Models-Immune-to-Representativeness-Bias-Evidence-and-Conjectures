To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since the prior probabilities and the exact likelihoods aren't provided, I will assume generalized values for the likelihoods based on the description provided for Adam, which indicates a strong alignment with certain characteristics.

### Assumptions:
- Given Adam's interests and characteristics, the likelihood \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is assumed to be high, as it closely aligns with his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication.
- The likelihood \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \) is assumed to be lower due to his quieter, empathy-driven personality which might not align as closely with typical business administration profiles.

### Simplified Calculation:
Without precise prior probabilities and population proportions in these fields, we'll make reasonable educated guesses based on common scenarios.

Let's use the following assumed likelihoods in absence of exact data:
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.2 \)

Assuming broad equal priors \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \), we proceed.

### Normalizing Factor:
\[ P(E) = P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P( \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P( \text{business administration}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

2. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|\text{business administration}) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|\text{business administration}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
