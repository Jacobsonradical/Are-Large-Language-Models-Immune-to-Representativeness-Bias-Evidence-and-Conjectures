To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional information: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Given that these are not provided, we will have to make some reasonable assumptions based on Adam’s personality sketch. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values, let's assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are roughly equal for simplicity. We will then focus on estimating the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Given Adam’s features:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Curiosity about nature and plants is highly consistent with this field.
- Love for animals is a strong indicator.
- Appreciation for hard work is relevant, given the demanding nature of agricultural studies and veterinary practice.

### For Business Administration
- Although high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are valuable, Adam's specific interest in nature, plants, and animals is not particularly relevant to business administration.
- Empathy and appreciation for hard work are necessary but not unique to this field.

Given these points, we can make a rough estimate of the likelihoods based on how closely the personality sketch fits each field.

Let's estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural \& veterinary}) \approx 0.85 \)
- \( P(E|H_{business administration}) \approx 0.25 \)

Since we assumed \( P(H) \) is roughly equal for both fields for simplicity, the priors could approximately be the same. Thus, the posterior probabilities are directly proportional to these likelihoods.

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}
```

These values suggest a much higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration based on the provided personality sketch.
