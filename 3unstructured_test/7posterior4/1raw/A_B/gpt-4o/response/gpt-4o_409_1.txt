To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. **The prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of being enrolled in a given field.
2. **The likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in a specific field.
3. **The evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing \( E \) across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without exact numerical data, we'll make reasoned estimations based on the descriptions provided.

### Prior Probability \( P(H) \)

For simplicity, we assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field reflects a typical distribution of graduate students across different fields, but we adjust slightly based on the nature of the fields and the U.S. context. For this exercise, let's assume:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H_{ag}) = 0.1 \) (10%)
- Business administration: \( P(H_{bus}) = 0.2 \) (20%)

These priors are just estimates and can be adjusted based on more specific data.

### Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)

We use the personality sketch to estimate the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
   - Deep love for animals
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work

These characteristics strongly align with this field. We might estimate \( P(E|H_{ag}) \approx 0.9 \) (90%).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could fit here.
   - Other key attributes do not strongly align with typical business administration attributes (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature).

Therefore, \( P(E|H_{bus}) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

### Evidence \( P(E) \)

\( P(E) \) is challenging to determine without exhaustive data. However, for relative comparison, we can simplify the calculations assuming the comparisons of likelihoods and priors provide insight.

### Calculation

Using Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} \]
   Given \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields in this comparative scenario:
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{bus}|E) \propto P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Normalization (for insight)

To compare meaningfully, we can normalize these values:

Total: \( 0.09 + 0.02 = 0.11 \)

Thus,
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.818 \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.11} \approx 0.182 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818,
  "business administration": 0.182
}
