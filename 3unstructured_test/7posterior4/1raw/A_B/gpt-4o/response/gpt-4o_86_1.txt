To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to work with the rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) before seeing evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

To determine these probabilities specifically, more context is usually needed, like empirical data about graduate enrollments and personality traits by field. For simplicity and to heuristically compute the values given limited information, we can make reasonable assumptions and proportional estimations.

### Applying Bayes' Rule Heuristically:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, etc.) aligns with getting people enrolled in business administration. This is relatively low as these traits do not strongly correlate with the typical curricula or career paths in business.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): The prior probability. Business administration is a common field, but based on Adam's traits, it's less likely.
   - \( P(E) \): Constant for both fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood that Adam's personality aligns with getting people enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is relatively high given Adam's stated curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy which align well with this field.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The prior probability. This may not be as common as business admin, but Adam's traits strongly correlate.
   - \( P(E) \): Constant for both fields.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate rough probabilities. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) has a higher relative weight compared to \( P(E|H_{BA}) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are heuristic estimations considering how well Adam's profile matches each field. With more specific data or larger context, these estimates could be refined.
