To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

We have to make reasonable estimates for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), given the information in the personality sketch.

For this problem, let's assume the following:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in a specific field of study. We'll consider these to be reasonably distributed across several fields.

Given the personality traits, it's intuitive that Adam's likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science is higher than in business administration.

Let's assign some reasonable likelihoods and priors:

- **Business Administration:**
  - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has those personality traits given he is in business administration (likely low — say, 0.1).
  - \( P(H) \): The general probability of a graduate student being in business administration (let's estimate this as 0.15, assuming there's a significant fraction of students enrolled in business programs).

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam has those personality traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science (likely high — say, 0.7).
  - \( P(H) \): The general probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science (let's estimate this as 0.05, as it's a more specialized field).

To calculate \( P(E) \), we sum over all possible hypotheses, but since we only need comparative probabilities, we can skip a precise calculation here and use a normalization factor later.

Let's simplify the application of Bayes' rule without exact \( P(E) \):

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.035 \)

Normalize these probabilities:

- Sum of non-normalized probabilities = \( 0.015 + 0.035 = 0.05 \)

- Normalized probabilities:
  - Business Administration: \( \frac{0.015}{0.05} = 0.3 \)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.035}{0.05} = 0.7 \)

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
