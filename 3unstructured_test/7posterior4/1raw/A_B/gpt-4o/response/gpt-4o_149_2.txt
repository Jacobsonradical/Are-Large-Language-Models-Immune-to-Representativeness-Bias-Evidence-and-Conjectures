To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given \( E \), the personality sketch of Adam, we need to estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior \( P(H) \) for each field. The denominator \( P(E) \) is constant for both hypotheses, so we can focus on the numerator for relative comparison.

For the purposes of this exercise, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in either field. Since no additional data is provided, we consider both fields to have an equal baseline probability among graduate fields.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits given his enrollment in each field.

Given the personality sketch:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
- The traits align less closely with business administration, though high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are valuable in any field.

Assuming equal priors and focusing on the likelihoods:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

These relative values suggest that based on his personality traits, Adam is far more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
