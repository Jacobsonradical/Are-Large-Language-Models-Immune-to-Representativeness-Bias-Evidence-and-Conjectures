To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in each of the fields (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without detailed prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field, we can only infer rough estimates based on the information provided.

Let's reason through the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration**: 
   - The personality traits in \( E \) suggest a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, which are less closely related to business concepts. Business administration might favor traits like leadership, strategic thinking, and financial acumen more prominently. 
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) would likely be low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - The personality sketch strongly aligns with traits suitable for agricultural and veterinary science, such as a love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{agricultural \& veterinary}) \) would likely be high.

Given these qualitative assessments, without exact numerical values, we can provide educated guesses:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80
}
```

These values indicate that it is much more likely for Adam to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration, based on the provided personality sketch.
