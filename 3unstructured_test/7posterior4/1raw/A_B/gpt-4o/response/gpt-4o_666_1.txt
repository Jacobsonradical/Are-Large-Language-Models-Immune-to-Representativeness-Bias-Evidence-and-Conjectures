To compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we must take into account certain factors:
1. The likelihood of Adam's characteristics given each field (P(E|H)).
2. The prior probability of enrollment in each field (P(H)).
3. The marginal likelihood of Adam's characteristics across all fields (P(E)).

For simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities and likelihoods from general knowledge about graduate fields and Adam's personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \(P(H|E)\) as the posterior probability given the evidence E.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis H.
- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \(P(E)\) as the overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Hypothesis 1: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Given Adam's characteristics (love for nature, animals, empathy, and intelligence), it's highly likely he fits into this field.
- Assume \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8\) (high likelihood given the fit).
- Assume \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1\) (a reasonable prior probability).

### Hypothesis 2: Business Administration
- Adam's characteristics do not particularly point towards this field strongly.
- Assume \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2\) (low likelihood given the fit).
- Assume \(P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2\) (a reasonable prior probability).

For simplicity, let's assume \(P(E)\) is the same for both cases and normalize later.

Now, letâ€™s compute the posterior probabilities:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \]

### Business Administration
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Let's normalize these values by setting \(P(E) = 1\) for simplicity in posterior context:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{k} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{k} \]

Normalizing by the sum of unnormalized probabilities:
\[ k = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 + 0.04 = 0.12 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.12} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.67 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
