To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence and the prior probability of each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, I'll base the relative likelihoods on the provided personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in the mentioned fields. Since exact calculations aren't possible without concrete numbers, the estimates will be subjective probabilities.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles (indicative of strong analytical skills).
- He has empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits seem to align more strongly with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. 

Let's assign subjective probabilities for each field:

1. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E | \text{business administration}) \): The traits mentioned are less typical of the field.
   - \( P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): The traits are very indicative of the field, especially the love for nature and animals.

2. **Priors:**
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)

For simplicity, let's assume:
- P(E) remains constant as it just normalizes the posterior probabilities.
- The prior for each field \(P(H)\) as equal (i.e., each field is equally likely before considering the evidence).

Given this information, the subjective posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Here, 0.2 and 0.8 reflect the relative fit of Adam's personality traits to the typical characteristics of students in each field, with a stronger alignment found in agricultural and veterinary science.
