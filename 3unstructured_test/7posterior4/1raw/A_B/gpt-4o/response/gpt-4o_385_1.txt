To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, P(H|E), for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need more information about the priors (prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field) and the likelihoods (probability of each field given the personality sketch). However, without such specific numerical information, I can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on how well the personality sketch matches each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which can be regarded as a normalizing constant in this context.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and deep love for animals, combined with solving puzzles and empathy, it seems more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. His attributes such as warm heart, empathy, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit roles that require understanding and dedication found in agricultural and veterinary sciences more than in business administration.

Thus, the qualitative assessment would reflect higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

The provided numerical values between 0 and 1 are illustrative, reflecting that based on the given personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration. If more specific numerical data were available, these estimates might be adjusted accordingly.
