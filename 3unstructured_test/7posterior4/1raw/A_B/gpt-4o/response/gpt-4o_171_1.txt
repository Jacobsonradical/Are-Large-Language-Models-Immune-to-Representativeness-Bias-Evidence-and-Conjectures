To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we first need to identify the relevant pieces of information for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we aim to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we are not given specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we make qualitative assumptions based on the given sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it's quite likely that someone with such traits would be in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H) \): We assume moderate prior probability as many could be in this field but not excessively high since there are many graduate fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The traits described (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence) are less directly aligned with business administration.
   - \( P(H) \): We assume a lower prior probability for Adam to be in business administration given the personality sketch.

Now, we normalize and provide qualitative probabilities to compare these fields.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,  // Higher probability due to nature/plant curiosity and love for animals
  "business administration": 0.10  // Lower probability due to less alignment with described traits
}

Please note that these values are estimations based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with the fields mentioned.
