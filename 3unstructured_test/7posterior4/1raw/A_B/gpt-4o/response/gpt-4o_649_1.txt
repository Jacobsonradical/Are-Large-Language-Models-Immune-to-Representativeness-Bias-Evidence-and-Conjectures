To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the necessary specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \). Instead, we can provide a qualitative analysis based on the given personality sketch.

**Bayes’ Rule Breakdown:**
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):** The initial likelihood of Adam being in a specific field without considering his personality traits.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):** The probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is in a specific field.
3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(E) \):** The overall probability of observing the personality traits, which acts as a normalizing constant.

We can qualitatively assess these values:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \):**
   - Business Administration: Common graduate field.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Less common but aligning closely with Adam's interests.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Business Administration: Unlikely to align closely with Adam's traits (nature, plants, animals).
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Much more likely given his interests.

Given that Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, and given his empathetic personality, the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science seems considerably more probable.

Let's qualitatively assign higher probabilities accordingly:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the much stronger alignment of his interests and traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration, even though they don’t sum up to 1 because there could be other fields considered separately.
