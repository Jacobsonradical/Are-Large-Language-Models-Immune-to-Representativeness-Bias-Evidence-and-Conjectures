To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the likelihoods \( P(E | H) \), the priors \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific empirical data for the exact priors, likelihoods, or evidence, we have to rely on a qualitative assessment based on the information provided in the personality sketch of Adam.

Here is a reasoned qualitative assessment of the probabilities:

1. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's deep love for nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work, it does not align strongly with the stereotypical attributes of a business administration student, which tends to focus more on management, finance, and organizational skills rather than nature and empathy. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is more aligned with Adam's personality traits and interests. His love for nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy directly relate to agricultural and veterinary science, which often involves a deep understanding of these elements.

Based on our qualitative assessment:
- For **business administration**, the hypothesis seems less likely given Adam's personality traits and interests.
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the hypothesis seems more likely.

Here is an estimated qualitative assessment of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

Please note that these values are subjective estimates based on the provided descriptive elements and common associations with the respective graduate fields. In a real-world scenario, more specific statistical data would be needed to provide accurate probabilities.
