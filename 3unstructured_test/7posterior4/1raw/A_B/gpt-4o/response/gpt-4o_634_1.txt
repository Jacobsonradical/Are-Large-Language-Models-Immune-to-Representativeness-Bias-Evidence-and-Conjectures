To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior probability** \(P(H)\): The initial probability of being enrolled in a particular field without knowing personality sketch E.
2. **Likelihood** \(P(E|H)\): The probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in the specific field.
3. **Evidence** \(P(E)\): The overall probability of observing personality sketch E, considering all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, let's make some reasonable qualitative assumptions about the likelihoods based on Adam's personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature, it's likely that the personality traits described would fit well for someone in this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is high.
- **Business Administration (BA)**: Adam's traits, such as a love for solving puzzles and high intelligence, could be useful in business administration, but his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less directly relevant. Thus, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is lower.

For the prior probabilities \(P(H_{AVS})\) and \(P(H_{BA})\), we will assume that the chances of being in either field are roughly equal among graduate students in the U.S., as a simplification.

Since we don't have exact numerical values, we'll assign conceptual values to likelihoods:
- Let \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.9 \)
- Let \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3 \)
- Let \( P(H_{AVS}) = P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming equal prior probability for simplicity)
- \( P(E) \) is normalized across all fields.

Therefore, the posterior probabilities (ignoring \( P(E) \), as it normalizes automatically) will be:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03 \]

Since Bayes' rule normalizes the results, we can rank these relative to each other without explicitly calculating the normalization:

Here's the posterior conditional probabilities in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,  // Approximate relative probability normalized
  "business administration": 0.25  // Approximate relative probability normalized
}
```

So, while these values are not precisely computed without exact data, they reflect the intuitively higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
