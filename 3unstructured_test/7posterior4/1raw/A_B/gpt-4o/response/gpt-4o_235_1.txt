To calculate the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of observing evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

Given that we don’t have specific values for these probabilities, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the details provided.

### Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): A high likelihood. Adam’s personality sketch indicates a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with AVS.
   - \(P(H_{AVS})\): Assume this to be moderate to low, as not a very large fraction of graduate students pursue AVS.
   - \(P(E)\): Keep this constant for normalization.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): A lower likelihood. The personality traits related to empathy, curiosity about nature, and animals do not strongly align with common perceptions of BA.
   - \(P(H_{BA})\): Assume this to be higher generally, since BA is a popular field.
   - \(P(E)\): Keep this constant for normalization.

### Posterior Probability Calculation:
Since we don't have exact probabilities, we can present a qualitative estimate reflecting our reasoning.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect:
- A high posterior probability that someone with Adam's personality sketch is pursuing AVS.
- A low posterior probability for BA, as Adam's traits do not align well with this field based on typical expectations. 

These values are meant to represent relative likelihoods rather than absolute probabilities. For precise values, additional data about enrollment statistics and personality trait correlations with these fields would be necessary.
