Computing the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule requires several components: the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood of the evidence under each hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll consider the likelihoods based on how well the sketch fits each field of study:

1. **Business Administration**: This field typically requires interest in economics, management, finance, etc. While a quiet boy with strong empathy and high intelligence can fit into this field, the specific interests in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles are less typical for Business Administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy. The high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication also support this field.

Let's hypothetically assign some values based on subjective assessment due to lack of exact data:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E | H_{\text{Business Administration}}) &\approx 0.1 \\
P(E | H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) &\approx 0.8 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. If exact probabilities are not known, we'll assume equal priors as a simplification:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) &= 0.5 \\
P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) &= 0.5 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Now, we'll compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since other fields are also possible, \( P(E) \) should be considered as a normalizing factor; however, since we don't need the probabilities to sum to 1, we'll compare the relative posterior probabilities directly:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}|E) &\propto P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05 \\
P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) &\propto P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Normalizing these to sum to a total probability less than or equal to 1 is possible if needed, but for now, we keep them as relative strengths directly.

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
