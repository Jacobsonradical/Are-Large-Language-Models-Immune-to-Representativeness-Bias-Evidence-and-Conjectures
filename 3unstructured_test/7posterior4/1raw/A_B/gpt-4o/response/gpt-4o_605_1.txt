To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**: This is the likelihood of a student being enrolled in each field before considering their personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since exact numbers for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihood \( P(E|H) \) are not provided, I'll work with general qualitative assumptions and reasoning.

### Qualitative Reasoning

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
  - Let's assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity (though this is likely not accurate in practice, you might need more context-specific priors).
    - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.5 \) 
    - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.5 \)

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - Personality sketch \( E \) fits more closely with people in agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
    - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is high.
    - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) is lower, as the traits described don’t typically align with business administration.

### Posterior Probability Calculation

Given these qualitative assessments:

- Let’s suppose \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \)
- Let’s suppose \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
  
Because the prior probabilities were assumed to be equal,

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.5 + 0.9 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.05 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

For business administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.5} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = 0.1 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.5} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = 0.9 \]

### Final Answer in Required Format

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These values are based on qualitative reasoning and the assumptions made. For accurate results, actual priors and likeliness should be used if available.
