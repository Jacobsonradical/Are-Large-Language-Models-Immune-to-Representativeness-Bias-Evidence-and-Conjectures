To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

- The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being in a given field.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the normalizing constant ensuring all probabilities sum to 1.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and would be the same across all hypotheses, it suffices to focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to compare the probabilities across different hypotheses.

Given the personality sketch for Adam, let's make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate, given it is a significant, though not the largest, field of graduate study.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, because the sketch does not particularly align with typical traits associated with business administration (e.g., interest in finances, management).
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, given business administration is a large field of graduate study.

Now let's denote:
- Prior for Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming it is around 10% based on graduate enrollments in various fields).
- Prior for Business Administration \( P(H_{\text{Bus}}) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming it is around 20% based on graduate enrollments).

For likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.8 \).
- For Business Administration, let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{Bus}}) \approx 0.2 \).

Since we are not given normalization factors, we compute the relative probabilities:

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{Bus}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{Bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Bus}}) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04
\]

Finally, normalize to make these comparable (by dividing by the sum of the unnormalized probabilities):

\[
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{Bus}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.08 + 0.04} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33
\]

Based on these approximations, the probabilities can be summarized as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.67",
  "business administration": "0.33"
}
