To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following information for each hypothesis \( H \):

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence.

Bayes' Rule is given as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we'll make subjective assessments based on the personality sketch provided.

### Business Administration

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** A graduate student in Business Administration might exhibit traits like high intelligence, and an understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. However, a genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and enjoying solving puzzles might be less directly related to the field.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \):** Business Administration is a common field of study, so let's assign it a reasonable prior.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \) (this value is arbitrary and just for estimation).

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** A graduate student in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is very likely to have a genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals. They might also enjoy solving puzzles related to scientific research and exhibit strong empathy.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \):** Agricultural and Veterinary Science is a less common graduate field compared to Business Administration but fits Adam's personality well.
   - Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.05 \) (this estimate is arbitrary and just for calculation purposes).

### Calculation
We won't calculate \( P(E) \) explicitly since it serves as a normalizing constant, but we'll compare the numerators of Bayes' rule for relative probabilities.

#### Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ \propto 0.04 \]

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \]
\[ \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ \propto 0.04 \]

Given the similarity in these simplified relative scores, let's assume the relative probabilities, normalized, yield approximately:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This suggests that Adam is more likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his personality sketch, compared to Business Administration.
