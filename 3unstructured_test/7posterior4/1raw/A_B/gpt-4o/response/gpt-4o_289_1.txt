To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the prior probability of each field \( P(H) \) and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided and general knowledge about these fields.

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits closely align with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high.
   - Considering that many students might choose this field for its alignment with such interests, we can assume a moderate prior \( P(H) \).

2. **business administration**:
   - While Adam is intelligent and appreciates hard work, business administration might not directly align with his primary interests in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is relatively low.
   - Given the broader range of personality types that might choose business administration, we can assign a higher prior \( P(H) \), though it doesn't strongly align with Adam's personality.

Let's assume some numbers:
- Prior for agricultural and veterinary science \( P(H_{\text{ag}}) \): 0.1 (10%)
- Prior for business administration \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \): 0.2 (20%)
- Likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \): 0.8 (80%)
- Likelihood for business administration \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \): 0.3 (30%)

Using these values:
For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ag}})}{P(E)} \]
Here, \( P(E) \) is constant for both conditions, we use it only to compare values.

\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Now normalize these values:
Total proportional values = 0.08 + 0.06 = 0.14

\[ P(H_{\text{ag}}|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.14} = 0.57 (or 57\%) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.14} = 0.43 (or 43\%) \]

These values are subjective and based on assumptions. Professional computation would require real data.

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.43
}
```
