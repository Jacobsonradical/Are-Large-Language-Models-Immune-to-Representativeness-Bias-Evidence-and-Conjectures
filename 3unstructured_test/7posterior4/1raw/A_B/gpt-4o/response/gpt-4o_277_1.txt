To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, lacking concrete data about prior probabilities and distribution, I'll proceed with an educated estimation based on the description provided.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work, it is far more likely that he would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, which doesn't align closely with his personality traits.

For the sake of this calculation, let's use qualitative reasoning. We assume:

- High probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- Low probability of Adam being in business administration given his personality sketch.

Here are the qualitative estimates, expressed in values between 0 and 1:

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx 0.1
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx 0.8
\]

Therefore,

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Please note these values are based on subjective judgment given the descriptive information. For a precise calculation, detailed statistical data about the distribution of students in various fields given their personality traits would be necessary.
