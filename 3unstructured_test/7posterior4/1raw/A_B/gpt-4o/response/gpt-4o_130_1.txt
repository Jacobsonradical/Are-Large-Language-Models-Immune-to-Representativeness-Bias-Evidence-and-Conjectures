To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to make use of the following formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the evidence \(E\).

Given the personality sketch \(E\), let's make educated guesses regarding the probabilities for both fields.

Assumptions and assignments:
1. \(P(H_{business} | E)\) might be quite low because the personality traits described for Adam (love for nature, warmth, empathy for animals, etc.) do not strongly align with typical characteristics sought in Business Administration.
2. \(P(H_{agricultural} | E)\) might be significantly higher because Adam's characteristics align well with someone interested in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, especially the genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals.

For \( P(H_{business}) \) (prior probability for Business Administration), let's assume this to be a moderately common graduate field, so roughly \(\frac{1}{10}\).
For \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) (prior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science), let's assume this is less common compared to business, so roughly \(\frac{1}{20}\).

Let's assume:
\[ P(E|H_{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \]
Because the evidence \(E\) fits better with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

The total probability \(P(E)\) can be summed over all hypotheses, but for simplicity, let's denote it as \(P(E) \approx 0.5\) given it's amongst various fields.

Now, applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business administration}) \cdot P(H_{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.5} = 0.02\]

\[ P(H_{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.5} = 0.09\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities for each field can be approximated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09
}

Please note that these numbers are based on educated guesses and assumptions regarding probabilities. The actual values would require more specific information or data.
