To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood of his personality sketch given each field, and the overall probability of the personality sketch.

The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the overall probability \( P(E) \). In the absence of specific data, we can instead make qualitative estimations based on the information given.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work. These traits strongly align with this field.
2. **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent and good at abstract concepts, there isn't a strong indication in his personality sketch that aligns heavily with business interests, making this field less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on these qualitative assessments, let's provide reasonable estimates for the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values are higher for agricultural and veterinary science due to the strong alignment of the personality traits with the field, whereas business administration has a lower probability since the alignment is weaker.
