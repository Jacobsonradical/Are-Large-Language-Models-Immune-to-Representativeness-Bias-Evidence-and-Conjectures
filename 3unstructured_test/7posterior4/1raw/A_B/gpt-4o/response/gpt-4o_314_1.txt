Using Bayes' rule, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) can be computed using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

While we don't have the exact values for these probabilities, we can qualitatively evaluate how well the evidence \( E \) aligns with each field. 

Based on the personality sketch of Adam, here is a qualitative assessment:

- **Business Administration**: 
    - \( P(E|H) \): This field does not strongly align with Adam's described interests and qualities, such as his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of abstract concepts.
    - \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a common graduate field, so the prior probability is moderate to high.
    - Overall: Given the evidence \( E \), the field of Business Administration is less likely compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \( P(E|H) \): This field highly aligns with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
    - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than Business Administration but fits the evidence better.
    - Overall: Given the evidence \( E \), Agricultural and Veterinary Science is more likely.

Here's a rough estimation in numerical format:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

These values are approximations demonstrating that Adam's personality is much more aligned with a field like Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Business Administration. The actual posterior probabilities would require precise priors and likelihoods.
