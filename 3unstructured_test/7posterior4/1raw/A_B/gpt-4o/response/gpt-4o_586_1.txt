Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability P(H|E) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H, multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis H. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we need to estimate the posterior probabilities for his field of enrollment in business administration (H1) and agricultural and veterinary science (H2).

To simplify, let's make some reasonable assumptions for the sake of this exercise:

1. \( P(E|H1) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is enrolled in business administration. Let's assume this is relatively low because curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are not as strongly associated with business administration. We might assign a value of 0.1.
2. \( P(E|H2) \): The probability that Adam has the given personality traits given he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This is likely higher, as these fields align well with his characteristics. We might assign a value of 0.8.
3. \( P(H1) \) and \( P(H2) \): Assume the prior probabilities for Adam enrolling in these fields are equal, as we have no additional information. Let's set both to 0.5.
4. \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and cancels out in the normalization.

Using Bayes' Rule (with simplified assumptions):

\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

To find the exact values, we'd need to normalize such that:

\[ P(H1|E) + P(H2|E) \le 1 \]

Since there are other fields, this sum doesn't need to equal 1. Thus, we update without normalization for other fields.

By a straightforward proportion:

\[ P(H1|E) \approx 0.05 \]
\[ P(H2|E) \approx 0.4 \]

Formatted response:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
```

These values represent the posterior conditional probabilities given Adam's personality sketch without considering the probabilities of other fields.
