To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to give specific numerical values, we would need detailed statistical data on the likelihoods and priors, which are not provided in this context. Instead, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on Adam's personality sketch and then proceed with an educated estimation.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration might be lower because Adam's described interests and traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication) align less with typical profiles of Business Administration students.
   - The prior \( P(H) \) for Business Administration can be considered average to high due to the general popularity of this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science would likely be higher given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which align well with the interests typically associated with this field.
   - The prior \( P(H) \) might be lower compared to Business Administration, given that fewer students generally pursue this specialized field.

Taking these qualitative assessments into consideration, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on his personality sketch, even though these are not precise numerical calculations.
