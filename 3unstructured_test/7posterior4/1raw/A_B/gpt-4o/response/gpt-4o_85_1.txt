To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given the personality sketch of Adam using Bayes' rule, we need some additional details such as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we do not have exact values for these, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the information given. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, his deep love for animals, and his understanding of hard work and dedication, it seems reasonable that he may have a relatively high likelihood of being enrolled in this field.
   
   - Assume high likelihood \( P(E|H_{agri}) \): 0.8
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{agri}) \): Let’s assume relatively high, perhaps 0.15

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, the personality traits and interests match less closely with a business administration field.
   
   - Assume lower likelihood \( P(E|H_{bus}) \): 0.3
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{bus}) \): Let’s assume moderate, perhaps 0.2

Let's normalize the probabilities to compare them properly, noting that these priors do not add up to 1 and are used for relative comparison.

Using Bayes’ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{\sum_{i}P(E|H_i)P(H_i)} \]

For simplification, we focus just on the terms of interest.

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agri})P(H_{agri})}{P(E|H_{agri})P(H_{agri}) + P(E|H_{bus})P(H_{bus})} \]
\[ P(H_{agri}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.06} = \frac{0.12}{0.18} = 0.67 \]

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{bus})P(H_{bus})}{P(E|H_{agri})P(H_{agri}) + P(E|H_{bus})P(H_{bus})} \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2} = \frac{0.06}{0.12 + 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} = 0.33 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
```
