To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given Adam's personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence, the prior probabilities of each hypothesis, and the probability of the evidence itself.

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \), we'll make qualitative assumptions based on the provided personality traits.

Here's the reasoning:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication make "agricultural and veterinary science" highly likely.
- The same traits seem less indicative of enrollment in "business administration", which typically focuses more on management, economics, and organizational behavior, and less on nature or animals.

So, while exact numerical values are not provided, we can deduce relative likelihoods based on the given information.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative likelihoods based on the given personality traits of Adam, with "agricultural and veterinary science" being significantly more likely than "business administration".
