Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to make plausible assumptions about the prior probabilities and the likelihoods, given the information we have about Adam.

Given that Adam is described as having a strong empathy, a deep love for animals, and a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it seems more likely that he was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" compared to "business administration".

Here is a rough estimation, assuming:
- \( P(\text{E}) \) is constant for both fields. 
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) of choosing "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher based on Adamâ€™s interests.
- The likelihood \( P(\text{E|H}) \) of Adam having such personality traits given that he is studying "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher compared to "business administration".

With these considerations, the estimated values could be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Here, we assume:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \) to be relatively low due to his interests and traits.
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) to be relatively high for the same reasons.

Note that these values are illustrative and based on assumed probabilities given the personality sketch provided. They are not exact and would ideally require more detailed statistical data to be precise.
