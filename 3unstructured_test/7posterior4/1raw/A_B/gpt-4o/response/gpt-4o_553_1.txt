Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch (E) and the hypothesized fields of study (H):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
2. **Business Administration**

In order to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and prior probabilities:

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10% of students are in this field).
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \) (i.e., 20% of students are in this field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given Adam's traits are a strong match for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, let's assign \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8 \).
   - Given Adam's traits are less relevant to Business Administration, let's assign \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Prior Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is a normalizing constant to ensure probabilities sum to 1 for all possible fields.

We can begin by computing the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H=\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto P(E|H=\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(H=\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

\[ P(H=\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto P(E|H=\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(H=\text{Business Administration}) = 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Total Probability of Evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(H=\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) + P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(H=\text{Business Administration}) + \ldots \]

Using the above computations, the total evidence probability is the sum of contributions from all considered fields:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.04 + \text{(other fields)} \]

Given that other fields contribute to the total probability, but we are focusing on normalization for these two fields, we consider:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.04 = 0.12 \]

### Normalizing:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.12} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

### Results

Given our assumptions and computations, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.33
}
