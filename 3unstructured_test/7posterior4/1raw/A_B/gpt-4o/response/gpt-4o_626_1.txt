To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior probabilities** of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. **Likelihood** of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because we lack specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we'll provide qualitative reasoning based on the information available.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) is relatively high for this field.
- **Likelihood (P(E | H))**: His personality traits such as love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
- **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The prior probability of Adam being in business administration is less likely based on the given description (focused on nature, animals, and abstract concepts rather than typical business traits).
- **Likelihood (P(E | H))**: His personality traits do not strongly align with the typical skills and interests required for business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probability \( P(H | E) \) for each field would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are indicative and based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical requirements and characteristics of these fields of study.
