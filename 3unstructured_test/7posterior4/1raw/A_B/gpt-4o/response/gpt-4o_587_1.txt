To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we would use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, detailed quantitative values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided. Therefore, we'll make educated guesses based on qualitative analysis. Let's assume the following:

1. \( P(E|H_{business}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration might be low because his interests and traits seem more aligned with science and empathy-related fields rather than business.
2. \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
3. \( P(H_{business}) \) and \( P(H_{agricultural}) \): The prior probabilities of him being in either field can be assumed to be equally probable without specific information, but given the personality traits, we might lean toward agricultural and veterinary science.

Using qualitative reasoning, the posterior probabilities might be:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This reflects a higher probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the given personality sketch. These values are not exact and are intended as reasoned estimates based on the information provided.
