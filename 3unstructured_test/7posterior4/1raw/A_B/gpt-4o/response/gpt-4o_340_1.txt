To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam's enrollment in the specified fields given his personality sketch \( E \), we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

We will mainly focus on the likelihood terms because the priors and marginal likelihood (denominator) can be complex and often require specific statistical data, which is not provided here. As such, we will reason about the likelihood based on the personality match to each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his empathy, it is highly likely that he would be enrolled in a field that aligns with these interests.

2. **Business Administration:** While Adam's empathy and high intelligence could be beneficial in business administration, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals make it less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, the rough values for the likelihoods could be reasoned as follows based on the provided information:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agr. and vet. science}}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business admin.}}) = 0.2 \]

Assuming equal priors \( P(H_{\text{agr. and vet. science}}) = P(H_{\text{business admin.}}) = 0.5 \) for simplicity, the posterior probabilities would be proportional to the likelihoods.

Thus, even without precise priors:

\[ P(H_{\text{agr. and vet. science}}|E) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin.}}|E) \approx 0.2 \]
