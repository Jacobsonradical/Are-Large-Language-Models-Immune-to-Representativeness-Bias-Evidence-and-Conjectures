To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start from Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given are the following:
- \( E \) (Personality sketch of Adam)
- \( H \) (Hypotheses: Adam's field of study, either "agricultural and veterinary science" or "business administration")

Let's denote \( H_1 \) as "agricultural and veterinary science" and \( H_2 \) as "business administration".

Bayes' theorem in this context will be:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

To compute these probabilities, we need to estimate:
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The likelihood of the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given that we don't have detailed numerical data, we'll make qualitative assessments to assign values.

1. **Estimating Likelihoods:**
   - Given Adam's personality (a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, empathy), it is reasonable to assume that these traits strongly align with a field like agricultural and veterinary science.
   - In contrast, these traits appear less likely to be strongly associated with business administration.
   Hence, \( P(E|H_1) \) is likely higher than \( P(E|H_2) \).

2. **Estimating Priors:**
   - Suppose the prior probabilities of Adam being in either field are fairly general and equal due to lack of specific data, e.g., \( P(H_1) \approx 0.5 \) and \( P(H_2) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Estimating \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \) can be computed as the normalization factor but knowing it is constant helps simplify comparisons without specific values.
   
Based on this qualitative information, making plausible assignments:

\[
P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \quad \text{(high likelihood given alignment)}
\]
\[
P(E|H_2) \approx 0.2 \quad \text{(low likelihood given lesser alignment)}
\]

Using these estimates:

\[
P(H_1) = 0.5 \quad \text{(prior)}
\]
\[
P(H_2) = 0.5 \quad \text{(prior)}
\]

\[
P(E) \quad \text{(common normalizing factor)}
\]

Then:

\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2)P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.5}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1}{P(E)}
\]

\( P(E) \) cancels out when comparing probabilities. Now, normalize these to add up to 1 for comparison purposes:

Let's calculate the relative probability:

\[
P(H_1|E) : P(H_2|E) = 0.4 : 0.1 = 4 : 1
\]

Normalize these values:
\[
P(H_1|E) = \frac{4}{4+1} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = \frac{1}{4+1} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2
\]

Hence, the approximate conditional probabilities are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
