To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), Bayes' rule is applied:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack the exact numbers for prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). Instead, we can make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch and known characteristics of the fields.

Given Adam's personality sketch (E) includes high intelligence, strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it aligns more closely with the characteristics desirable in the field of agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

1. **Business Administration**
   - **P(E|H)** (Likelihood that Adam, with his description, fits someone in Business Admin): Generally seen as low, because empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not core traits associated with Business Admin students. While high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are useful, they aren't enough to strongly fit the business administration profile.
   - **P(H)** (Prior probability of being enrolled in Business Admin): Moderate to high, as business administration encompasses a broad and popular field of study.
   - **P(E)**: The likelihood of the personality sketch independent of the field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(E|H)**: High, given the love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy are central to these fields.
   - **P(H)**: Moderately high for an empathetic and nature-loving individual, as this field matches those interests and traits well.
   - **P(E)**: Same as above.

Without exact numerical data, we estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

In essence, Adam's traits much more strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, making it the more likely field of study.
