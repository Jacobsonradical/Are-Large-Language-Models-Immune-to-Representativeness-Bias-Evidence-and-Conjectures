Bayes' rule for computing the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step outline to compute these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents our initial belief about the hypothesis before seeing any evidence. For simplicity, let's assume that each field of specialization is equally likely, given we do not have exact prior probabilities from the problem.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. We need to assess how likely it is for someone with Adam's personality traits to be enrolled in each of these fields.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) across all fields. Since it is a constant and we're looking for the relative posterior probabilities, we can ignore it for ranking purposes.

Using this framework, let's make some educated guesses based on Adam’s personality sketch:

- **Business Administration**: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
  - Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are not typically aligned with a field that focuses on business, finance, management, etc.
  - These traits are less indicative of someone choosing Business Administration, so \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)
  - Adam’s curiosity about nature, animals, and empathy are strongly related to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
  - His appreciation for hard work and dedication fits well with this field. 
  - These traits highly correlate with someone likely to be in this field, so \( P(E|H) \) would be relatively high.

Given these considerations, we can now assign relative posterior probabilities. Note that these values are subjective approximations based on the information given:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values imply that Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration according to his personality traits given in the sketch.
