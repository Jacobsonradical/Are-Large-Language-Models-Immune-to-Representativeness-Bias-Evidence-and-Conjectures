To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we would need prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since we only have the sketch of Adam's personality and the fields to consider, we can make qualitative estimates based on the given information.

Bayes' rule can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without concrete values for \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis), \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each hypothesis), and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the evidence), we can only provide qualitative assessments based on how well Adam's personality fits with each field.

Given Adam's:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants,
2. Strong empathy and love for animals,
3. High intelligence and abstract thinking,
4. Quiet demeanor enjoying solving puzzles, 
5. Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication,

He seems to be a better fit for "agricultural and veterinary science" over "business administration."

Here's the qualitative estimate:

\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{"agricultural and veterinary science"} & : 0.85, \\
\text{"business administration"} & : 0.15 
\end{align*} 
\]

Therefore, the result can be formatted as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```
