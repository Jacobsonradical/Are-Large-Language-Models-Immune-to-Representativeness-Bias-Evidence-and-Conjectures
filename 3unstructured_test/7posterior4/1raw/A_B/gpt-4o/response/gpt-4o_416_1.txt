To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a simplified step-by-step approach to the calculation for both fields:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This represents the probability that a graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in a particular field before considering Adam's personality traits. Specific statistics on the proportion of students in each field can be useful here, but let's assume hypothetical priors based on general knowledge:

    - Business Administration: Let’s assume \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.20 \) or 20%.
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Let’s assume \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \) or 5%.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is studying in each field. This is more subjective but based on Adam's interest in nature, animals, and abstract thinking:

    - Business Administration: This field generally requires skills in management, marketing, and finance. Adam’s characteristics do not strongly align with this field, so let’s estimate \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.10 \) or 10%.
    - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam’s traits strongly align with this field due to his curiosity in nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.70 \) or 70%.

3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(E) \)**: This represents the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields. It’s not easy to calculate without extensive data, but for simplicity, we can say that:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + \text{other fields contributions} \]

Let’s assume for simplicity that other fields contribute to a combined total that doesn't overwhelm our current hypothesized values.

Now, using this information to plug into Bayes' Formula:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

Given the complexities of exact marginal probabilities, let's assume \( P(E) \) keeps the denominators reasonable for these slices:

### Calculation:

#### For Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = 0.02 / P(E) \]

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = 0.035 / P(E) \]

As the `P(E)` is common and just for comparative purposes assume \(P(E)\) as proportional combined approximately:

\(
P(E) \propto (0.02 + 0.035) = 0.055
\)

\[
P(H_{AS}|E) \propto \dfrac{0.02}{0.055} \approx 0.36
\]
\[
P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto \dfrac{0.035}{0.055} \approx 0.64
\]

Here's the comparative likelihood but approximate values as we overlooked contributions from fields not listed:
