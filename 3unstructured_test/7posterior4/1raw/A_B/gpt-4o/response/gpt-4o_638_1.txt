To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Without explicit data on the priors or likelihoods, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch to approximate these values.

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems highly probable that he would be interested in fields closely connected to nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration, while potentially requiring problem-solving skills, is less closely connected to his described interests.

**Assumptions for Bayes' rule:**

1. Priors (\( P(H) \)):
   - Let's assume a prior distribution where individuals are equally likely to be enrolled in each graduate field if no other information is provided.

2. Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):
   - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High, since his attributes are well-aligned with this field.
   - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Moderate to low, as this field does not strongly align with his personality traits except for abstract problem-solving ability.

Now, letâ€™s use an approximate approach to assign subjective probabilities:

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E) \) can be normalized across all fields but here we just need a comparative measure.

For **Business Administration:**
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \)
- Similarly, assuming a comparative measure for \( P(E) \).

Now, we will use these subjective likelihoods to estimate the posterior probabilities.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are interested in relative comparisons and \( P(E) \) will be the same for all, we can simplify it:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

**Estimates:**
\( P(H|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \propto 0.9 \cdot \text{prior} \)
\( P(H|\text{business administration}) \propto 0.3 \cdot \text{prior} \)

Given the above assumptions and normalization, we provide the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Actual probabilities may vary with exact priors and likelihoods, but our subjective estimates align well with the given personality sketch.
