To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for the fields "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration," given the personality sketch E of Adam, we can use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is formulated as follows:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of observing evidence E.

Since we do not have specific values for prior probabilities (\(P(H)\)) and likelihoods (\(P(E|H)\)), we will make educated estimates based on the provided personality traits and how well they align with each field.

### Hypothesize Likelihoods and Prior Probabilities:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)): Given the student's characteristics, he shows a strong alignment with nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which correlates well with this field. We estimate a high prior probability.
   - Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)): Since the personality traits closely match those typically found in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood is high.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)): Adam's traits (strong empathy, love for nature and animals, enjoyment of solving puzzles) do not strongly align with the typical skill set and personality usually associated with business administration. We estimate a lower prior probability.
   - Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)): The characteristics mentioned (empathy, nature curiosity, etc.) aren't particularly aligned with business administration; thus, the likelihood is lower.

### Quantitative Estimation:
Given these considerations, we estimate the posteriors qualitatively.

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} | E) & \approx 0.75 \\
P(\text{Business Administration} | E) & \approx 0.1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Computation:
Since we aren't given specific numbers, these are our best-informed estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality sketch with each field.
