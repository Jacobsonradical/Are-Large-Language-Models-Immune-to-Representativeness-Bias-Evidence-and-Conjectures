To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide exact values for \(P(H|E)\), we need to know or estimate several factors:
1. The prior probability \(P(H)\) for each hypothesis.
2. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. The evidence \(P(E)\), which normalizes the posterior probabilities.

Without explicit data, I'd assume some reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch and typical distributions in graduate fields. Given the nature-oriented qualities and emotional characteristics described in the sketch, we can make educated guesses about the likelihoods.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.3 \) (prior probability)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.2 \) (prior probability)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \) (likelihood of evidence for business administration)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.6 \) (likelihood of evidence for agricultural and veterinary science)

Now let's calculate the posterior probabilities modulo the normalization factor \(P(E)\):

1. For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.3}{P(E)} = \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \]

2. For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{P(E)} \]

While the exact posterior values require normalizing by \(P(E)\), the relative likelihood gives us an indication of which hypothesis is more plausible. 

Thus, the final estimated values in terms of relative strength without normalization would be:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{"business administration"}: 0.03\\
  &\text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.12
\end{aligned}
\]

And formatted as requested:

  "business administration": 0.03,
