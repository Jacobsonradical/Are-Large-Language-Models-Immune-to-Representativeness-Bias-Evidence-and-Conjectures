To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Unfortunately, without specific data on prior probabilities and exact likelihoods, we must rely on educated estimates based on typical characteristics and distributions.

For simplicity, let's assume that the priors for both fields are equal, meaning \( P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \). 

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given that \( P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \), the key differentiator is \( P(E|H) \).

### Likelihoods:
- For business administration: Adam's personality traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals do not strongly correlate with typical business administration traits. Thus, \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) is likely low.
- For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and warm heart, align very well with the traits typically found in this field. Hence, \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is likely high.

### Posterior Estimates:
Given the qualitative assessments, we estimate:
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \] to be low, e.g., around 0.1,
\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \] to be high, e.g., around 0.9.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Using these estimates:
- For business administration,
  \[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming equal priors,
  \[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.1 \]

- For agricultural and veterinary science,
  \[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

Assuming equal priors,
  \[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.9 \]

Hence, the responses in the specified format would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
