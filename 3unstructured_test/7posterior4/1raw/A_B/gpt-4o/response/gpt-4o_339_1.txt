To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we can qualitatively estimate the relationship.

Given Adamâ€™s personality sketch, it is more likely that he was enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science given his genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, his love for animals, and his empathy. Business administration is less likely given his personality traits.

Therefore, we can make an educated qualitative estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  (This is higher because Adam's traits align more closely with this field)
  "business administration": 0.1  (This is lower because Adam's traits align less with this field)
}

These values are estimations and not exact calculations, as exact values would require more detailed statistical data.
