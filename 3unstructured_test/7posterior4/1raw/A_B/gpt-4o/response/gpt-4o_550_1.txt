To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we would typically need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) that Adam was enrolled in either field, and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which reflects how likely it is that someone with Adam's personality characteristics would be in each field. Without precise prior probabilities or likelihood values, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality characteristics described and intuitively considering the relevance of each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agriculture and veterinary science.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high for this field.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's personality doesn't directly indicate a fit with business administration, which typically involves interpersonal skills and a focus on economics and management rather than nature or animals.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is lower for this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide reasonable estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values indicate a higher likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits more closely with a field related to agriculture and veterinary science as opposed to business administration.
