To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the lack of specific quantitative data on likelihoods and priors, we have to make some educated estimations based on the provided information.

### Assumptions and Reasoning

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Relatively higher due to Adam's curiosity about nature, love of animals, and understanding/appreciation for hard work and dedication.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, since curiosity about plants, empathy for animals, and patience for detailed work fit well with this field.
    - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Expected to be higher.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Lower relative to Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to less direct correlation with Adam's personality traits.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Lower, as his traits of empathy, puzzle-solving, and nature-related interests are not major indicators of a business-focused personality.
    - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Expected to be lower.

Estimated calculations for \( P(H|E) \) (without detailed data, this is a qualitative assessment):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

Given these estimated values:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** has a high posterior probability at 0.75 due to the close alignment of Adam's personality with the field.
- **Business Administration** has a low posterior probability at 0.10 because Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with this field.
