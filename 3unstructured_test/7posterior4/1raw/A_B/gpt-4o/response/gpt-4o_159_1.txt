To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science or business administration based on his personality sketch, we implement Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, let's make some assumptions, as exact priors and likelihoods are unknown. Typically, these would be determined by empirical data:

1. Prior Probability (\(P(H)\)):
   - Letâ€™s assume graduate students in the U.S. are equally likely to be in any field, but agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration.

2. Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)):
   - The personality sketch highly aligns with the traits beneficial to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - The personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits beneficial to business administration.

Let's denote our assumptions about priors and likelihoods:
- \( P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(business\ administration) = 0.3 \)

- \( P(E|agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|business\ administration) = 0.1 \)

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant for both calculations and acts as a normalizing factor, we can focus on the numerators directly for comparison:

\[ P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science|E) = P(E|agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) \cdot P(agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science) = 0.9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.09 \]

\[ P(business\ administration|E) = P(E|business\ administration) \cdot P(business\ administration) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Given these computations (with the realization that actual results would require precise priors and empirical data), we can state the answers in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration as a graduate student.
