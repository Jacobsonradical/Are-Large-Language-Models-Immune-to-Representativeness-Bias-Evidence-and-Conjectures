To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). However, without specific data on these probabilities, we can only make educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Given the personality sketch, the subject has a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and displays high intelligence and empathy. These traits make it more likely for Adam to be enrolled in fields related to nature and animals compared to business administration.

Let's break down our assumptions:

1. **Business Administration (H1)**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H1) \)**: Generally, business administration is a popular field, but people with a strong interest in nature and animals might be less likely to pursue this.
     - Let's assume \( P(H1) = 0.2 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \)**: Given Adam's personality, his characteristics are less aligned with the typical traits sought in business administration (e.g., curiosity about nature, empathy for animals).
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H1) = 0.1 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H2) \)**: This field is less common than business administration but directly aligns with Adam's interests.
     - Let's assume \( P(H2) = 0.05 \).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \)**: Adam's personality fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Let's assume \( P(E|H2) = 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only comparing relative values and don't know \( P(E) \) (which would be the same for both hypotheses in this simple analysis), we can ignore the denominator for comparative purposes:

For **Business Administration (H1)**:
\[ P(H1|E) \propto P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**:
\[ P(H2|E) \propto P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]

After normalization (ensuring the numbers are in the same comparative range):
\[ P(H1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.045} = \frac{0.02}{0.065} \approx 0.3077 \]
\[ P(H2|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.02 + 0.045} = \frac{0.045}{0.065} \approx 0.6923 \]

Thus, our findings suggest:

{
  "business administration": 0.3077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6923
