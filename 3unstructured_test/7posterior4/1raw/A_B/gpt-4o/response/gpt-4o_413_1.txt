To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. P(H): The prior probability of each hypothesis.
2. P(E|H): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
3. P(E): The overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we need to provide a value between 0 and 1, and in the absence of specific numerical priors and likelihood values, we can make educated guesses based on the description provided in the personality sketch, which suits more closely to one or more fields. 

Adamâ€™s personality sketch suggests:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its plants.
- Strong empathy, love for animals.
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, we make rough estimations regarding the fields:

1. Business Administration:
   - While intelligence and appreciation for hard work may align with this field, the other characteristics like curiosity for nature, love for animals, empathy, and warmth don't strongly align.
   - Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in business administration (P(E|H)) is relatively low.

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Most characteristics like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy fit well.
   - Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science (P(E|H)) is relatively high.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can reasonably assign higher probabilities to Agricultural and Veterinary Science and lower probabilities to Business Administration.

The answer, represented in the required JSON format, is an educated guess:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This is a hypothetical estimate given the qualitative nature of the personality sketch. For exact calculations, real statistical data for priors (P(H)) and likelihoods (P(E|H)) would be necessary.
