To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both conditions and our task is to compare the two fields based on the given personality sketch, we will focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

1. **business administration**:

Given the traits described (curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, appreciation for hard work), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Business Administration could be considered relatively low, as these traits are more closely aligned with fields like natural sciences or veterinary sciences. While critical thinking is important in business, the specific love for nature and animals might be less relevant. 

For simplicity:
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is moderately low, say 0.2.
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for any specific graduate field (generically speaking) without additional information might be around 0.1 (assuming there is a large number of possible fields).

So, \( P(H|E) \) for business administration:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02 \]

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:

Given Adam's traits and interests, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, as this field directly aligns with his curiosity about nature, plants, animals, empathy, and intelligence.

For simplicity:
- Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high, say 0.8.
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) remains around 0.1 for any specific field.

So, \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Thus, the approximate posterior conditional probabilities given the assumptions and simplifications are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```
