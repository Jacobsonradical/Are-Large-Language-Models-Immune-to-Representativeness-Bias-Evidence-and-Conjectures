To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case, \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field, and \( E \) represents Adam's personality sketch.

Since we do not have specific probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided. Here are the assumptions:

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) are assumed to represent the prior probabilities of being enrolled in these fields before considering the personality traits.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) represents the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) represents the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is more likely that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. We can express this with qualitative probabilities.

Let's assign:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \) (assuming this is a less common field overall)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \) (assuming this is a more common field overall)

We assume the denominator \( P(E) \) is constant for comparison purposes.

Applying Bayes' rule, we get:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Since these probabilities are qualitative and comparative:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.160,
  "business administration": 0.060
}

After normalizing for comparison, we get:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,  // 0.160 / (0.160 + 0.060)
  "business administration": 0.273   // 0.060 / (0.160 + 0.060)
}

These are subjective probabilities based on qualitative analysis and assumptions made due to lack of exact data. 

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.727",
  "business administration": "0.273"
}
