To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have certain probabilities:

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, since we don't have the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \) for each field, I will provide a qualitative assessment instead.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Adam’s traits strongly align with fields that relate to nature, animals, and possibly research-oriented fields rather than business-oriented ones.

### Assessing \( P(H|E) \) qualitatively:

#### Business Administration:
- Business Administration often involves leadership, management, finance, and organizational behavior, which may not directly align with Adam's described interests and empathy toward animals and nature.
- Given Adam's profile, it’s less likely he would choose this field.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- This field directly aligns with Adam's interest in plants, animals, and nature.
- His empathy and strong appreciation for hard work would be beneficial in understanding and caring for animals and working in agriculture.
- Adam's curiosity and intelligence would help him excel in the scientific and research aspects of this field.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the calculated posterior probabilities (although not numerically exact) would reflect a stronger likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science as compared to Business Administration.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are heuristic estimates based on the alignment of Adam’s personality with the demands and nature of each field.
