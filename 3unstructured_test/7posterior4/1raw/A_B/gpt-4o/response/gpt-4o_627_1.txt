To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood or the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch and the fields, we need to make educated estimations.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
2. **Business Administration (H2)**

Let's denote:
- \( H1 \): Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H2 \): Adam is enrolled in business administration.

The evidence \( E \) suggests Adam has a curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, loves animals, and appreciates hard work and dedication. With this information, we can estimate the conditional probabilities.

- \( P(E|H1) \): High, as agricultural and veterinary science aligns with his interests in nature and animals.
- \( P(E|H2) \): Low, as business administration is less aligned with his personality sketch.

We assume the prior probabilities \( P(H1) \) and \( P(H2) \) are based on general enrollment statistics in graduate programs but skewed towards Adam's characteristics. Let's estimate:

- \( P(H1) \approx 0.15 \) (since fields related to nature and veterinary science are less common but still notable).
- \( P(H2) \approx 0.3 \) (business administration is a common field).

The overall evidence \( P(E) \) is difficult to determine precisely, but since it remains constant in both calculations, we can simplify it in the proportions.

Given strong alignment for agricultural and veterinary science and relatively low alignment for business administration:

- \( P(E|H1) \) is very high, let's estimate \( P(E|H1) \approx 0.85 \).
- \( P(E|H2) \) is quite low, let's estimate \( P(E|H2) \approx 0.1 \).

Now applying Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:

\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H1)P(H1)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H2)P(H2)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same across both, we can consider its fractional influence in a normalized fashion:

1. Compute the numerator for each:
   - For \( H1 \): \( P(E|H1)P(H1) = 0.85 \times 0.15 = 0.1275 \).
   - For \( H2 \): \( P(E|H2)P(H2) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \).

2. Normalize to get the final probabilities:

The approximations would imply:

\[ P(H1|E) \approx \frac{0.1275}{0.1275 + 0.03} \approx \frac{0.1275}{0.1575} \approx 0.8095 \]

\[ P(H2|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.1275 + 0.03} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.1575} \approx 0.1905 \]

So, the resulting probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8095",
  "business administration": "0.1905"
}
