To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Without empirical data for exact probabilities and assuming equal priors (since we have no information suggesting otherwise), we adjust for the likelihood based on how well Adam's personality sketch fits the reasonable expectations for each field. The personality sketch strongly aligns with fields involving nature, animals, and problem-solving, giving us a sense of the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Let's assign the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on qualitative fits:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: High fit due to Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- Business administration: Lower fit because the sketch does not mention any specific attributes related to business, finance, or management, and instead focuses on natural sciences and problem-solving.

Assigning approximate values to these (the exact values are illustrative due to the qualitative nature):

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \]

Assuming equal priors for now (\( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \)):

Let's compute the normalized posteriors (as an illustrative example without exact marginals):

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is a common normalization factor:

\[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.7}{0.7 + 0.1} \approx 0.875 \]
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.7 + 0.1} \approx 0.125 \]

So the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.875,
  "business administration": 0.125
}

These values reflect the higher fit of Adam's personality sketch with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration, given the qualitative information provided.
