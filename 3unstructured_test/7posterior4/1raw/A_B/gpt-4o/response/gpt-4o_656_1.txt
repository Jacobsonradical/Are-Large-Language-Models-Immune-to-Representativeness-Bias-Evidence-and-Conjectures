To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we start with the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Bayes' rule tells us how to update our beliefs about \( H \) in the light of new evidence \( E \).

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \), i.e., the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of Adam having his personality sketch \( E \) if he was enrolled in the given field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, i.e., the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the complexity and general nature of the problem, we don't have exact numbers for each of these probabilities. We need to make educated guesses based on the information provided.

### Assumptions:
- Adam’s personality traits are particularly well-suited to Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy.
- These traits are less typically associated with Business Administration, which usually emphasizes different skills (e.g., leadership, management, financial acumen).

### Estimations:
- Assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field is equal since we don’t have specific information about the prevalence of these fields.

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.5 \] 
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.5 \]

- Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is much higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science than for Business Administration.

### Values:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \)

### Normalization:
Since there are many other possible fields of study, we will not normalize these probabilities to sum to 1, as instructed.

### Bayes' Calculation:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

### Result:
Using heuristic normalization proportional to the estimated likelihoods times the priors:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{\text{constant}} = 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{\text{constant}} = 0.1 \]

Thus:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are based on the specific nature of Adam's personality traits and the general compatibility with the two fields mentioned.
