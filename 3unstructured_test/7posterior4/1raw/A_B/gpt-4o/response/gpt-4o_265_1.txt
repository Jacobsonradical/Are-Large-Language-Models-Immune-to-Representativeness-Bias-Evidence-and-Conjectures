To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \). To provide a reasonable estimate, we will use the given personality sketch \( E \) to qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) and assume some general priors.

### Assessing Likelihoods:
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and preference for solving puzzles do not particularly align with typical traits emphasized in business administration, such as leadership, management skills, and strategic thinking. This suggests \( P(E|H_{business\_administration}) \) might be relatively low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, and strong intelligence in understanding abstract concepts align closely with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. This suggests \( P(E|H_{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) \) would be high.

### Assessing Priors:
- **Business Administration**: It's a common graduate field, so let’s assume a moderate prior probability, \( P(H_{business\_administration}) \).
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: It’s less common than business administration but aligns much more with Adam's personality traits. Hence, we assume a reasonable prior probability, \( P(H_{agricultural\_and\_veterinary\_science}) \).

Given these qualitative assessments, we estimate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect our judgment that Adam's personality traits significantly favor a field related to nature and animals over one related to business.
