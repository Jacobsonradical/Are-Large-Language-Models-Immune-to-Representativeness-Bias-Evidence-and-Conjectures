The task requires the calculation of posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch \( E \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we do not have specific prior probabilities and likelihood values, a qualitative assessment will guide these calculations. For simplicity, I'll assume equal priors and infer likelihood based on the match between Adam's personality traits and the typical traits associated with each field.

### Qualitative Assessment:
1. **Business Administration:**
   - Business administration students often have interests in economics, management, leadership.
   - Adam's traits show empathy, curiosity about nature, intelligence, problem-solving, and love for animals, which are not typically aligned with business traits.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration may be relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field frequently attracts individuals interested in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and environmental work.
   - Adam's traits closely align with this field.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

### Posterior Probabilities (Qualitative Estimates):
Given equal priors \( P(H) \) for both fields, the calculation simplifies to comparing \( P(E|H) \).

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration:** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is low due to the mismatch of Adam's personality with typical business administration traits.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high due to the strong alignment of Adam's personality with this field's typical traits.

These are estimates based on qualitative matches since precise priors and likelihoods are unavailable.
