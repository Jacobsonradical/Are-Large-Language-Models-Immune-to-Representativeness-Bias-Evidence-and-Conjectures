To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to have numerical values for the following probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In the absence of specific numerical data, we can make qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

**Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, as Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals are directly aligned with this field.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): We need a reasonable prior; let's assume that there is a moderate proportion of students in this field.
- \( P(E) \): The evidence includes traits that could correspond to several fields, somewhat rare.

**Field: Business Administration**
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low to moderate, as Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical traits required for business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Business administration is a popular field, so the prior probability is relatively high.
- \( P(E) \): Same as above.

Given the qualitative nature of our estimates, let's assign indicative values:

- For \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): 0.8 (high, given the alignment).
- For \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): 0.1 (let's assume moderate popularity).
- For \( P(E) \): Let's assume a rough value like 0.2 (as the personality traits are specific but plausible across several fields).

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

- For \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): 0.3 (low to moderate, given the lesser alignment).
- For \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): 0.3 (high popularity).
- For \( P(E) \): Same value as before, 0.2.

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.2} = 0.45 \]

So, the posterior probabilities we can deduce are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.45
}
```

Note: These values are indicative and based on qualitative assumptions due to the absence of specific numerical data for likelihoods and priors. Adjustments might be needed with concrete statistical data.
