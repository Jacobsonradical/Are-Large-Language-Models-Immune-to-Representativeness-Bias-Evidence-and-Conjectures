To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

To simplify this, we assume \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses considered, so we can focus on the numerator \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on how well the personality aligns with the typical characteristics and interests associated with that field. We also need an estimation of \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in a given field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) is high since Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \) is relatively low compared to some other popular fields but not insignificant.
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) is low since Adam's characteristics do not strongly suggest an inclination toward business administration (which often focuses on leadership, finance, management skills).
   - \( P(H) \) is relatively higher since Business Administration is a popular and common field for graduate students.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some illustrative probabilities:

- For \( P(E|H) \):
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8
  - Business Administration: 0.1

- For \( P(H) \):
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (assuming 10% of graduate students could be in this field)
  - Business Administration: 0.25 (assuming 25% of graduate students could be in this field)

Now, we can compute:

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_2) \times P(H_2)}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring \( P(E) \) as it's a constant:

\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \approx 0.025 \]

Normalizing these (for simplification purposes, though \( P(E) \) is still unknown):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.025} = \frac{0.08}{0.105} \approx 0.762 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.08 + 0.025} = \frac{0.025}{0.105} \approx 0.238 \]

Therefore:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.762",
  "business administration": "0.238"
}

This result is a qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch and typical priors for these fields.
