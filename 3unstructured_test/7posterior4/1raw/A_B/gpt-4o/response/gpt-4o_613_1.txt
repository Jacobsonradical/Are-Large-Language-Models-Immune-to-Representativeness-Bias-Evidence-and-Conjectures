To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \).

Since we do not have specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll make some educated estimates based on the personality sketch and general trends.

### Business Administration
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) estimation:**
  - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are relatively less common in business administration students.
  - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work somewhat relevant.

Estimated \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \): Low

- **Prior \( P(H) \) estimation:**
  - Business administration is a common field.

Estimated \( P(H_{business\ administration}) \): Average

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) estimation:**
  - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly relevant.
  - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts align with graduate studies in this field.

Estimated \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \): High

- **Prior \( P(H) \) estimation:**
  - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration, but quite relevant given the sketch.

Estimated \( P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \): Reasonably lower, but should be higher than average due to the relevant personality fit.

Combining these reasonings and normalizing roughly, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: These are subjective estimates based on the given personality sketch and general commonalities within each field of study. For precise computation, actual data on frequencies and field-specific personality traits would be required.
