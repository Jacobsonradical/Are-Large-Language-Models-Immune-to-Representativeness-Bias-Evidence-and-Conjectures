To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will utilize Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

For the fields in question:
- **Business Administration (Hypothesis \( H_1 \))**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (Hypothesis \( H_2 \))**

Given that we don't have exact empirical data, we'll rely on a qualitative assessment to assign reasonable values to the prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam.

### Summary of Personality Sketch (E):
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm-hearted, strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- Graduate student in 2021.

### Assigning Likelihood Values:

1. **Business Administration \( P(E|H_1) \)**
   - Curiosity about nature/plants: Low relevance.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate relevance.
   - Warm heart, empathy: Some relevance but not critical.
   - Love for animals: Low relevance.
   - High intelligence/abstract concepts: Some relevance.
   - Dedication/hard work: High relevance.

   Based on this, we might estimate \( P(E|H_1) \) to be relatively low to moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(E|H_2) \)**
   - Curiosity about nature/plants: High relevance.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles: Moderate relevance.
   - Warm heart, empathy: High relevance.
   - Love for animals: High relevance.
   - High intelligence/abstract concepts: Some relevance.
   - Dedication/hard work: High relevance.

   Based on this, we might estimate \( P(E|H_2) \) to be relatively high.

### Assigning Prior Probabilities:

- **Business Administration \( P(H_1) \)**: 
  Given the wide popularity of business administration programs, we might assign it a moderate prior probability.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science \( P(H_2) \)**: 
  More niche compared to business administration, we might assign it a somewhat lower prior probability, though balanced by the relevancy to Adam.

### Posterior Estimation:

We will assume rough values without exact data:
- \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(H_1) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(H_2) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and wonâ€™t need to be explicitly calculated for the comparison.

Now we compute:

1. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.2 \cdot 0.4 = 0.08 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Normalize these (for the sake of comparison):
- Total \( = 0.08 + 0.24 = 0.32 \)
- \( P(H_1|E) \approx \frac{0.08}{0.32} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H_2|E) \approx \frac{0.24}{0.32} = 0.75 \)

### Results:

{
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
