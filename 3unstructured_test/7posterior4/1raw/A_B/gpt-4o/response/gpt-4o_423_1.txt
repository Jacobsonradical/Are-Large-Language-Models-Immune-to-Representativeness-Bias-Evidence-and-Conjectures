To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality characteristics \( E \) given the fields and the prior probabilities of being enrolled in those fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given enrollment in a particular field \( H \), \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a particular field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field.

Without specific data on \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the information given in the personality sketch \( E \).

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is low because business administration does not strongly correlate with deep love for animals, nature, and a quiet personality focused on empathy and puzzles.
2. \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high because this field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication and hard work.

Given these assumptions, we can infer the relative magnitudes of \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

In this context, 0.1 and 0.7 are subjective probabilities that reflect the extent to which the personality sketch matches typical characteristics and values of people in those fields of study. Actual probabilities would depend on specific statistical data which are not provided here.
