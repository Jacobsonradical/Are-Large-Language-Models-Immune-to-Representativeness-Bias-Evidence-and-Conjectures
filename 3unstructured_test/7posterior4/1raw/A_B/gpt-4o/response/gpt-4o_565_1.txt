To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we do not have specific values for these probabilities, we will make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch of Adam.

**Business Administration:**
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence \( E \) does not align strongly with the characteristics typically associated with business administration students. These students are often associated with traits like leadership, decision-making, and economic interests rather than a deep curiosity about nature or a strong empathy for animals. Therefore, we assign a relatively low probability to \( P(E|H) \).
- \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field of study, so we assign a moderate prior probability.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(E|H) \): The evidence \( E \) aligns very well with the characteristics typically associated with students in agricultural and veterinary science. These students are often interested in nature, plants, and animals, and they possess qualities like empathy and dedication. Therefore, we assign a high probability to \( P(E|H) \).
- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is less common than business administration, so we assign a slightly lower prior probability.

Given these qualitative assessments, we obtain:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
