To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). To simplify, let's use qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality traits and interests to estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since exact values for prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, we'll make reasoned estimates to determine the relative posterior probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Prior \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \)**: Given Adam's traits, we might estimate the prior probability for this field as higher than average.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \)**: Given his traits fit well with this field, we estimate a high likelihood.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's personality sketch shows strong empathy, solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts, which could be beneficial in business administration. However, thereâ€™s less direct correlation with specific business traits compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Prior \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \)**: We assume this is lower than for agricultural and veterinary science given his strong inclination toward nature and animals.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \)**: Likelihood is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Estimating probabilities in a qualitative fashion:

\[
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx 0.7
\]
\[
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx 0.2
\]

Thus, the formatted answer is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates are qualitative and rely on the alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the characteristics typically associated with each academic field.
