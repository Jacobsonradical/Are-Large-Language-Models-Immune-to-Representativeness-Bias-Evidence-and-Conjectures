To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not only the given personality sketch \( E \) but also the prior probability \( P(H) \) of someone being enrolled in each field, and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of having the given personality traits given enrollment in each field. 

Bayes' rule can be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the probability \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses, it essentially acts as a normalizing constant and can be ignored for the purpose of comparing the two hypotheses. Thus, we can focus on the numerator: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Assessing the likelihoods and priors:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) strongly match those typically found in this field. Let’s assign a high value such as \( 0.8 \).
   - Prior \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): The proportion of graduate students in this field is relatively moderate. Let's assume a prior value of \( 0.1 \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \): Adam's traits don’t strongly align with typical traits for this field (business might better align with competitiveness, leadership, etc.). Let’s assign a lower value such as \( 0.2 \).
   - Prior \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \): The proportion of graduate students in business administration is quite high. Let's assume a prior value of \( 0.3 \).

### Posterior Calculation (without normalization):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \)
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \)
   - \( P(H|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \)

### Normalization (to convert proportional values to probabilities):

To find the normalized posterior probability, we add the proportional values and divide each by the total:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{8}{14} \approx 0.57 \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.08 + 0.06} = \frac{6}{14} \approx 0.43 \]

### Final Answer:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.43
