To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Let's assume some reasonable estimates for each component given the information we have:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration is \(0.2\) (20%).
   - Let's assume that the prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is \(0.05\) (5%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - For business administration, the given personality sketch (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals) doesn't strongly align. So, let's assume \(P(E|H)\) here is \(0.05\).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, the given personality sketch aligns well (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals). So, let's assume \(P(E|H)\) here is \(0.8\).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \(P(E)\)**:
   - This is the overall probability of observing the evidence. This can be computed as:
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) + ... \]
     For simplicity, let's say that it's a weighted average of the likelihoods across the main fields. Considering graduate fields are varied and numerous, let's assume \( P(E) \) to be reasonably moderate, say \(0.15\).

Now, let's compute the conditional probabilities:

For **business administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{business} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.2}{0.15} = \frac{0.01}{0.15} \approx 0.067 \]

For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{agriculture} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.15} = \frac{0.04}{0.15} \approx 0.267 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}
```

Note that these estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and simplifications. Actual probabilities could differ based on more precise data and models.
