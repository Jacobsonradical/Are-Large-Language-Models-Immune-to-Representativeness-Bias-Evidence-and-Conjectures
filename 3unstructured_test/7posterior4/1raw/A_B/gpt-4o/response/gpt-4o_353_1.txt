To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which can be considered constant for all fields in this context (it would cancel out when normalizing probabilities).

Given that precise values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) are not provided, we will make reasoned estimates based on the descriptions.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with agricultural and veterinary sciences. This field naturally aligns with his interest in plants and animals.
- **\( P(H) \)**: Let's assume the prior probability is reasonably high, given his personality traits strongly suggest a match.

### Business Administration

- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Some of Adam's traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could be applicable to business administration. However, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less directly relevant.
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability for business administration is assumed to be lower given the less direct alignment with his personality traits.

Without exact values, we need to make educated guesses to finish the Bayesian update:

### Estimates of Posterior Probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates reflect a high likelihood that Adam's personality aligns with agricultural and veterinary sciences and a lower, but non-negligible, likelihood for business administration.
