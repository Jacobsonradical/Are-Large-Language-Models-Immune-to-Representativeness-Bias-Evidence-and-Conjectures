To apply Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Given that exact values are not provided for these probabilities and considering the descriptions, we can provide qualitative assessments.

First, let's break down \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - High probability \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy, which align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Lower probability \( P(E|H) \): While Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to business administration, his strong inclinations toward nature, plants, and animals make this field less likely.

Next, we consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \). Generally, fewer students might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to business administration, making \( P(H) \) for business administration higher by default. However, given Adam's profile, we might shift these considerations.

Finally, \( P(E) \) can be considered similar across fields for simplicity since we don't have distinct fields-of-study probabilities.

Considering these points, here is a qualitative assessment of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values use qualitative judgments based on the provided personality sketch. For a precise computation, you'd need exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \).
