To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to break down the problem and use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since \( P(E) \) remains the same for both fields, we will focus on \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

Letâ€™s make the following assumptions for simplicity to provide a qualitative analysis rather than exact numerical:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   - The proportion of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is generally much lower than in business administration.
   - We'll assume: \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.1 \) and \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.25 \), assuming other fields take up the remaining proportion.

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Based on the personality sketch, Adam's traits strongly align with those required in agricultural and veterinary sciences (interest in nature, plants, love for animals).
   - These traits are less correlated with business administration.

We will denote:
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood)
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood)

Based on Bayes' rule:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) \]

Therefore, for agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]

Finally, we need to normalize these values to ensure they are probabilities (between 0 and 1). We'll use the sum of these unnormalized probabilities as a normalizing constant.

Normalization constant:
\[ 0.08 + 0.025 = 0.105 \]

Normalized values:
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.105} \approx 0.762 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.105} \approx 0.238 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.762,
  "business administration": 0.238
