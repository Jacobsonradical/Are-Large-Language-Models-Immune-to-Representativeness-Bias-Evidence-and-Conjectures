To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the probability \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, and the total probability \( P(E) \) of the evidence.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals), the prior probability \( P(H) \) of him being in this field is reasonably high.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The traits described are closely aligned with what would be expected of someone in agricultural and veterinary science, so \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Adam's traits do not strongly suggest a natural inclination towards business administration, so the prior probability \( P(H) \) is reasonably lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While it is possible, the traits mentioned do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration graduate student, so \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is lower.

Hence, the posterior probabilities would reflect these assessments. Assuming we don't have exact numerical prior probabilities, we estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality with the fields mentioned.
