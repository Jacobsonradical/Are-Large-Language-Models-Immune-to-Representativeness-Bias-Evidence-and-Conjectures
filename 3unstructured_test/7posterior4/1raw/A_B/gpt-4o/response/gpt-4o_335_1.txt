Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given the provided information, we'll need to make some assumptions for the sake of calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Let's assume the prior probabilities for enrollment in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science are based on national averages. For illustration purposes, these could be approximated values as follows:
     - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) = 0.25 (25%, a common field of graduate study)
     - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) = 0.05 (5%, a specialized field)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For a student with Adam's interests and traits, the likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science seems higher compared to business administration.
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) = 0.1 (low likelihood because Adam's interests don't align well with the typical business administration focus)
     - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) = 0.8 (high likelihood because of Adam's strong alignment with nature, plants, and animals)

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor ensuring that the probabilities sum to 1. For this scenario, \( P(E) \) is a constant and will cancel out when computing relative probabilities.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate the posterior probabilities.

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing these to make sure they sum proportionally, although not necessarily to 1 since they're not the only fields:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]

Now assuming these are relative to each other.

{
  "business administration": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values indicate that, given the personality traits and interests of Adam, he is significantly more likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
