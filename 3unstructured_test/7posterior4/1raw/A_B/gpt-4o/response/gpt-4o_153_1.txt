To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the likelihood of the given personality sketch \( E \) for each field.

Bayes' rule is given by the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being in each field, and without the exact probability \( P(E) \) of the personality sketch occurring regardless of the field, we must proceed with qualitative reasoning based on the provided description.

Given the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and empathy.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.

Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS) seems to align very well with his characteristics:
- Interest in nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication is essential in AVS.
- High intelligence to understand complex biological systems.

Now consider Business Administration (BA):
- Adam's traits are not strongly aligned with typical characteristics sought for business administration, such as leadership, competitiveness, and strategic thinking, although high intelligence and work ethic are relevant.

Without exact values for probabilities, we'll estimate relative likelihood based on qualitative alignment:

\[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \gg P(E|H_{BA}) \]

Approximately (in qualitative terms):

\[ \text{P(E|H_{AVS})}: 0.7 \]
\[ \text{P(E|H_{BA})}: 0.1 \]

Thus, given these evaluations, the probabilities might look something like:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```
