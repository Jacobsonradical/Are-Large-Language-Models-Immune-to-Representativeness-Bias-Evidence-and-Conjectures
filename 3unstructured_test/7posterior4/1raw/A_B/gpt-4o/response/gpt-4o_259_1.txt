To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science based on the characteristics of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \) as the prior probabilities that a graduate student is enrolled in business administration and agricultural and veterinary science, respectively.
- \( P(E|H_1) \) as the likelihood that Adam shows these traits if he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_2) \) as the likelihood that Adam shows these traits if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) as the overall probability of Adam exhibiting these traits across all fields of graduate study.

Given that I do not have access to specific probabilities for \( P(H_1) \), \( P(H_2) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make some educated assumptions based on the fields and Adam's personality sketch.

### Business Administration
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_1) \):** Adam's traits include genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals. These traits are less directly related to business administration, which typically attracts students with interests in leadership, management, finance, and economic strategies rather than empathy and animals.
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_1) \):** Assume a moderate to high prior since business administration is a common field of study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_2) \):** Adam's traits are highly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science. Curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work directly relate to this field.
- **Prior Probability \( P(H_2) \):** Assume a moderate prior as this field is less common than business administration but still significant.

### Priors and Likelihoods
Let's use some illustrative values:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students)
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.2 \) (reflecting a lower fit for business administration)
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.8 \) (reflecting a higher fit for agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor but not needed for relative comparisons.

### Compute Posteriors
We will calculate \( P(H|E) \) proportionally rather than exactly because we are comparing their values and do not know \( P(E) \).

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Now, normalize (optional as not specifically needed for comparison, but for accuracy):
Total \( = 0.04 + 0.08 = 0.12 \)

Normalized probabilities:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.12} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.12} \approx 0.67 \]
