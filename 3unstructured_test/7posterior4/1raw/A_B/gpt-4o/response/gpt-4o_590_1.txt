To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we need to estimate the probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Let's break down each component for both fields.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \): Given Adam's traits, there is a high likelihood he is in agricultural and veterinary science, as a deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy align well with this field.
- \( P(H_{agri-vet}) \): The prior probability of a random graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science is generally low compared to other fields like business, but still plausible.
- \( P(E) \): The overall evidence given the combination of traits related to agriculture and veterinary science.

### Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{bus-admin}) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's personality traits is in business administration is relatively low. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work may align, other traits like love for animals and curiosity about nature do not typically.
- \( P(H_{bus-admin}) \): The prior probability of a random graduate student being in business administration is generally higher as business programs are common.
- \( P(E) \): The overall evidence given the combination of traits related to business administration.

Given that we lack exact numerical data, we can only provide subjective estimations based on the descriptive information. Here is a reasonable approach:

### Estimations:
- \( P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \approx 0.8 \) (High likelihood given the traits)
- \( P(H_{agri-vet}) \approx 0.05 \) (Low to moderate prior)
- \( P(E|H_{bus-admin}) \approx 0.2 \) (Low likelihood given the traits)
- \( P(H_{bus-admin}) \approx 0.2 \) (Moderate prior)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and acts as a normalizing factor, we will proportionally compare them instead of computing it directly.

### Posterior computation:
\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri-vet}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.05 = 0.04 \]
\[ P(H_{bus-admin}|E) \propto P(E|H_{bus-admin}) \cdot P(H_{bus-admin}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \]

### Normalization:
Both fields end up with equal weighted scores, thus needing normalization so that they reflect their actual credible likelihood distributions:

- Sum of computed scores: \( 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08 \)

Hence, the normalized posteriors are:
\[ P(H_{agri-vet}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{bus-admin}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.08} = 0.5 \]

**Even though both hypotheses receive equal contributions based on calculation, subjectively skewing towards domain expectation modified seems worthwhile**

My insightful adjustment given the generality
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

Therefore, actual reflective practical distribution albeit: 
```json
Evauluated realistically conformant:
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.5"
}
```
Would conclude.
