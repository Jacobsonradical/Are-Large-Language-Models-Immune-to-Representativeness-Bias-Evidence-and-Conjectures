To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), prior probability \( P(H) \), and the total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we don't have specific values for the priors and likelihoods, we can make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Qualitative Assessments:

- **Business Administration:** 
  - Adam's traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts don't strongly align with the typical traits of a business administration student. Also, his deep appreciation for hard work and dedication might not be a deciding factor here.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{Business}) \): Relatively low

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Adam's warm heart, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are strongly indicative traits of someone pursuing agricultural and veterinary science.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \): Relatively high

Without specific numerical data, the following probabilities are qualitative estimates.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are reflective of the stronger alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science relative to business administration.
