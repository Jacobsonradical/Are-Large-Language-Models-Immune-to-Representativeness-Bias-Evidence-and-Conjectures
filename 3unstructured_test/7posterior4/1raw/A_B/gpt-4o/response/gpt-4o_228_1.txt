Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Given that we need to compute \( P(H|E) \) for both fields, we'll make some logical assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \) = business administration
- \( H_2 \) = agricultural and veterinary science

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \):
   - Without specific data on the distribution of graduate students across different fields, we might assume a uniform prior for simplicity. For instance, assuming there are many possible fields, it might make sense to assign a higher weight to more common fields like business administration. However, given Adam's interests, the priors shouldn't be equal and should favor agricultural and veterinary science more.

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \):
   - For business administration, the likelihood that Adam's characteristics match is relatively low, given his personality traits.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood is high given his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work.

3. **Marginal Probability** \( P(E) \):
   - It's the same for both hypotheses and will thus normalize the values. For simplicity, we do not need the actual value as we are only interested in comparing relativities.

### Estimations
1. \( P(E|H_1) \) might be relatively low, such as 0.1 (i.e., 10%).
2. \( P(E|H_2) \) might be relatively high, such as 0.8 (i.e., 80%).

3. Prior probabilities based on plausible guesses without empirical data:
   - Assume \( P(H_1) \) is 0.2 (i.e., 20% common among many fields).
   - Assume \( P(H_2) \) is 0.05 (i.e., 5% but more aligned with the given traits).

Thus using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't need the exact \( P(E) \) for comparison:
\[ P(H_1|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]

To normalize these values:
Total = 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.06

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.06} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.06} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.667 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.333",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.667"
}
