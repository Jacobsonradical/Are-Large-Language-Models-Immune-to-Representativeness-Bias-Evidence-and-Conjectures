To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of each field given Adam's personality sketch and any prior probabilities for each field. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the data, we'll make some assumptions for simplicity:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each graduate field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

We'll assume that P(E) remains constant as it represents the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch under any hypothesis.

Without specific prior probabilities, let's make some logical inferences based on the given personality traits.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - This field typically values leadership, quantitative skills, and communication. While some traits (like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts) might be applicable, others like a strong love for nature and animals do not align closely with the stereotypical business administration field. 
   - Likelihood consideration might be \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.1 \).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field matches closely with traits related to a love of nature, plants, animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. Given his interest in nature and animals, this field seems very compatible.
   - Likelihood consideration might be \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \approx 0.8 \).

Let's assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity (e.g., \( P(H_{business}) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H_{agriculture}) = 0.5 \)):

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{agriculture}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant, we can ignore it for relative comparison and normalization.

\[
P(H_{business}|E) \propto P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) \\
P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.5 = 0.05
\]

\[
P(H_{agriculture}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agriculture}) \cdot P(H_{agriculture}) \\
P(H_{agriculture}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H|E) = \{
  "business administration": \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.11, \\
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.4}{0.05 + 0.4} \approx 0.89
\}
\]

However, typically results would be normalized, but since the question permits values not summing to 1, we can leave them as is:

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
\]
