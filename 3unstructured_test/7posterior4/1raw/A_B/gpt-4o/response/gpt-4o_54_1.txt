To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields of "business administration" and "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the explicit numerical values for these probabilities. Instead, we can infer relative likelihoods based on the given sketch:

1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having this personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a student being enrolled in that particular field.
3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of having this personality sketch, which is the same for both hypotheses and hence will cancel out when comparing relative probabilities.

Let's assess the probabilities qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch:

### Business Administration:
- **P(E|H_business_administration)**: It is less likely that Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his quiet and empathetic nature, aligns well with the typical image of a business administration student. People in business administration may be more likely to enjoy networking, leadership, and corporate settings.
- **P(H_business_administration)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration can be considered moderate to high, as it's a popular field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(E|H_agricultural_veterinary_science)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns exceptionally well with his interests and personality traits.
- **P(H_agricultural_veterinary_science)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science can be lower compared to business administration but is still significant enough considering the context.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can estimate the relative probabilities:

- **P(E|H_agricultural_veterinary_science)** is much higher than **P(E|H_business_administration)**.

Hence, we could assign higher posterior probabilities to agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Using this qualitative approach, we provide the following estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that "agricultural and veterinary science" is significantly more likely for Adam given his personality sketch than "business administration."
