To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand how Bayes' rule works:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). However, without concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we can still provide an informed estimate based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Key details about Adam's personality sketch are:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Quiet, enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
6. Graduate student in 2021 in the U.S.

### Business Administration

- This field traditionally emphasizes leadership, management, finance, marketing, and economics rather than nature, plants, and animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could be relevant.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- Strong connection to nature, plants, and animals.
- Deep love for animals is highly relevant.
- Rural/agricultural work aligns with an appreciation for hard work.

Given these observations, it's much more likely that Adam's personality and interests align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than Business Administration.

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect qualitative assessments based on the provided sketch and the fields described. The relative likelihood of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is significantly higher due to its direct alignment with his interests and personality traits. The value for Business Administration, while non-zero, reflects a lower probability due to the less direct connection between his interests and this field.
