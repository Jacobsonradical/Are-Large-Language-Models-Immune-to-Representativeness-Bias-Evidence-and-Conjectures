To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we first apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will rely on heuristic assumptions based on the information provided.

### Evaluating \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

1. **P(E|H_agricultural and veterinary science)**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and a deep love for animals. This makes it highly likely that his characteristics are a good fit.
   - High values here, let's say approximately 0.8.

2. **P(H_agricultural and veterinary science)**: 
   - This is likely influenced by the general distribution of fields chosen by graduate students. Let's assume it's 0.2 considering the diversity of graduate fields.

3. **P(E)**: This is a normalizing constant based on the overall graduate population. Since we don't have this, we'll focus on relative probabilities.

### Evaluating \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration:

1. **P(E|H_business administration)**: 
   - Adam has traits like high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts that are valuable in business, but his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature align less with this field.
   - Moderate to low values here, let's say approximately 0.2.

2. **P(H_business administration)**: 
   - Given the popularity of business administration as a graduate field, let's assume this prior probability to be 0.25.

3. **P(E)**: Again, this is the same overall normalizing constant.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Using the above assumptions:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H|E)_{avs} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H|E)_{ba} \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]

Given these proportional values, we can note that the relative likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science is much higher compared to business administration. 

So in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.76",
  "business administration": "0.24"
}
```

This is based on our heuristic approach and relative values given Adam's profile. These probabilities are rough estimates and should ideally be refined with actual data.
