To estimate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given we don't have exact prior probability values or likelihoods for each field, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:

- Evidence \( E \) heavily indicates an interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, suggesting a higher likelihood for fields related to these interests.
- Business administration may not align as closely with these interests compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences, suggesting a lower likelihood.

### Estimations:

Suppose:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.05 \) (prior probability; more students are enrolled in other programs, but there is a non-trivial number in this field).
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.15 \) (prior probability; it's a common field, but not likely based on Adam's personality).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \) (likelihood; strong alignment with his interest in nature and animals).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \) (likelihood; lower alignment with his interests).

### Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.05) + (0.1 \times 0.15) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.015 \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.055 \]

### Posterior Probabilities:

1. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.055} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.04}{0.055} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.727 \]

2. For **business administration**:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \times 0.15}{0.055} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.055} \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.273 \]

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.727,
  "business administration": 0.273
}
```
