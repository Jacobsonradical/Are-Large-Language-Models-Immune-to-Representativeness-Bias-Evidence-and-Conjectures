To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (P(H)) and the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given his enrollment in each field (P(E|H)).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since P(E) is a normalizing constant and the exact values for P(H) and P(E) are not provided, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on the given personality sketch and the typical traits associated with each field.

For business administration:
- Generally involves strategic thinking, leadership skills, interpersonal communication, and decision-making.
- Adam's traits such as empathy and appreciation for hard work could align, but his deep love for nature and animals and preference for quiet, puzzle-solving activities might be less aligned.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- Directly involves nature, plants, animals, and requires both empathy and intelligence.
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very closely with this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, we should assign higher posterior probabilities to agricultural and veterinary science.

{
  "business administration": "approximately 0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "approximately 0.7"
}

These values are heuristically derived to reflect Adam's personality traits and how well they fit with the requirements and nature of each field. The actual numeric values are highly dependent on the true prior probabilities and specific likelihoods which are not provided in the problem statement.
