To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \(E\), which is a normalizing constant.

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
2. **Business Administration**

Given the personality sketch of Adam, here are some qualitative considerations:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy.
- These traits are highly relevant to fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- Business Administration might attract individuals with different traits focused on management, finance, and organizational skills, which are not emphasized in Adam's sketch.

### Assumptions for Prior and Likelihood
Without specific numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field, we have to qualitatively assess these values.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
- High likelihood \(P(E|H = \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})\) because Adam’s traits align well with this field.
- Prior probability \(P(H = \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})\), assuming it's a specialized but not obscure field among graduate students.

**Business Administration**:
- Lower likelihood \(P(E|H = \text{Business Administration})\) because Adam’s traits do not indicate a strong alignment with typical business administration students.
- Prior probability \(P(H = \text{Business Administration})\), assuming it's a common field among graduate students.

### Qualitative Posterior Probabilities
Given these qualitative assessments, here are the rough posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This means that, based on Adam’s personality sketch:
- There is an 80% chance that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- There is a 10% chance that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.

These values are provided for illustrative purposes. Accurate posterior probabilities would require specific numerical priors and likelihoods relevant to the distribution of graduate fields at the institution Adam attended.
