To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, you need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical data for these probabilities (\( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \)), we can only reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Given E, it's reasonable to consider:
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with the personalities often found in this field.
- Business administration: While high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are beneficial, the other personality traits described do not strongly align with a typical business administration profile.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities might be reasonably expressed as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are illustrative to express a higher likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration based on the provided personality sketch.
