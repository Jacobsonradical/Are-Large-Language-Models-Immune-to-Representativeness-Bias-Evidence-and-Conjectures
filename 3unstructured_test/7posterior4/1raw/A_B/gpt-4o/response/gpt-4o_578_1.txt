To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \), the prior probability of each field, and the overall evidence \( E \). Bayesâ€™ theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we're not given exact values for these probabilities and priors, we'll use qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch to estimate the likelihoods.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- Enjoyment in solving puzzles.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.

These traits align more closely with fields like agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probabilities) are roughly equal initially as no specific priors are given.
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihoods) will vary based on how well the personality traits fit each field.

**For business administration:**
- The traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less commonly core traits in business administration.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H_\text{business}) \) should be relatively low.

**For agricultural and veterinary science:**
- These fields highly value curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H_\text{agriculture}) \) should be relatively high.

Assuming equal priors, the overall evidence \( P(E) \) will normalize the probabilities, but the relatively high likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science will make \( P(H|E) \) higher for this field.

Given these considerations, let's propose the following estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of the personality sketch with each field. Exact probabilities would require more detailed data and priors.
