To apply Bayes' theorem, we need some assumptions and prior probabilities. Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of evidence \( E \).

Given we do not have exact statistical data, we'll work with qualitative assumptions based on the provided information:

1. \( P(E|H_{ag}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - High due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
    
2. \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
    - Lower, as the personality traits seem less aligned with typical attributes for business administration.

3. \( P(H_{ag}) \): The prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
    - Assume a reasonable figure based on common distributions of graduate studies. Suppose, \( P(H_{ag}) \approx 0.1 \).

4. \( P(H_{ba}) \): The prior probability of being in business administration.
    - Typically, more students pursue business administration compared to agricultural science. Suppose, \( P(H_{ba}) \approx 0.2 \).

5. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.
    - It is the normalization factor and doesn't affect the relative comparison between hypotheses.

Assuming:
- \( P(E|H_{ag}) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.3 \)

Now we compute:
\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag}) \cdot P(H_{ag})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is common, let's compare the numerators directly for relative values:

\[ P(H_{ag}|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing to keep the values interpretable in relative terms:

\[ \text{Sum of components} = 0.09 + 0.06 = 0.15 \]

\[ P(H_{ag}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.15} = 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.4 \]

Therefore:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```
These values are relative and only hold under the provided assumptions.
