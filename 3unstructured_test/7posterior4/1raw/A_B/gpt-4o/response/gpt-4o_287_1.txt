Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the step-by-step process with the assumptions for the given fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the field \( H \):
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals suggest that \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - For business administration, these traits (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature) are less predictive of Adam's field of study, so \( P(E|H) \) might be lower.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability, the likelihood of enrolling in either field without any additional information.
   - We can assume typical enrollment distributions for graduate students, which might vary by country and institution. For simplicity, we'll assume these probabilities without precise data.

3. **P(E)**: The evidence or the total probability of observing \( E \) across all possible fields. Since this involves multiple fields and is difficult to determine exactly, we can simplify by comparing the normalized probabilities.

### Calculation:

**1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\( H_1 \))**
- \( P(E|H_1) \): High (let's assume 0.75)
- \( P(H_1) \): Assume a moderate value typical for such fields in graduate study (let's say 0.1)

**2. Business Administration (\( H_2 \))**
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Lower due to less direct alignment with personality sketch (let's assume 0.1)
- \( P(H_2) \): Higher typical enrollment probability for business administration (let's assume 0.2)

Since we're comparing just these two fields, we can ignore \( P(E) \) for direct comparison.

### Relative Comparison:

\[ \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \text{ vs } \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

For comparison purposes:
\[ L_1 = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.75 \cdot 0.1 = 0.075 \]
\[ L_2 = P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Normalized probabilities (relative to each other):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{L_1}{L_1 + L_2} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.02} = \frac{0.075}{0.095} \approx 0.789 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{L_2}{L_1 + L_2} = \frac{0.02}{0.075 + 0.02} = \frac{0.02}{0.095} \approx 0.211 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities for Adam's enrollment based on the personality sketch are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.789",
  "business administration": "0.211"
}
