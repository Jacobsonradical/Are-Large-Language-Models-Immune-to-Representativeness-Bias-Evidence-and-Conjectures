To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need three primary components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's focus on the relative likelihoods and priors. Since we don't have precise numerical values for these, we will make reasoned estimates based on common knowledge and the information provided in the personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H_{BA}) \)**: Let's assume a moderate prior for graduate students being in business administration.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this is less likely for a business administration student.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H_{AVS}) \)**: Let's assume a lower prior since fewer students typically enroll in these fields compared to business.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \)**: Given Adam's personality sketch, this field aligns strongly with his interests and characteristics.

Given these assumptions, the likelihood of the personality sketch \( P(E|H) \) would be much higher for Agricultural and Veterinary Science than for Business Administration.

Without exact numerical values, I'll provide reasonable estimates:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values reflect that Adam's personality and interests are much more compatible with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Business Administration, resulting in a higher posterior probability for the former.
