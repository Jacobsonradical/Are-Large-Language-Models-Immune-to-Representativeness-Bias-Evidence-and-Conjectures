To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step approach to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's characteristics given he is enrolled in a specific field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the general probability of observing Adam's characteristics; it serves as a normalizing factor. We'll estimate using the fact that it remains the same in both scenarios.

Given that we don't have exact numbers, we will make educated guesses to estimate:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**
   - Let's assume there are many potential fields Adam could have enrolled in. The probability of a specific field (like business administration or agricultural and veterinary science) being chosen without additional information might be roughly equal if there are many fields, i.e., \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{\text{number of fields}} \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are strong indicators of a fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Business administration, although broad, generally doesn't specifically align with the empathy for animals and curiosity about nature Adam shows.

3. **Normalizing Evidence \( P(E) \) for all fields (which we can analyze relatively)**:
   - This doesn't need to be explicitly calculated because we’re comparing the ratios.

Using these considerations, we can roughly estimate:

\[ \text{For business administration (H)}: \]
- \( P(E|H) \) is likely low because Adam's characteristics don't strongly indicate a typical fit for business administration.
- \( P(H) \) might be estimated as marginally plausible.

\[ \text{For agricultural and veterinary science (H)}: \]
- \( P(E|H) \) is high because Adam's characteristics strongly align with this field.
- \( P(H) \) might be higher due to the alignment of Adam's interests and skills.

Typically, for an exact calculation, we need precise values for these terms. Given our rough estimation and comparing relative likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher than for business administration.

Let's estimate relatively:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values are illustrative and based on the qualitative alignment discussed, focusing on the fit of Adam's personality with typical characteristics and requirements of each field.
