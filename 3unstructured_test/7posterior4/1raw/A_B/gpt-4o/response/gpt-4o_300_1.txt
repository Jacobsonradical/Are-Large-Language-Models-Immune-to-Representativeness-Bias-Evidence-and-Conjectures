In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \) of each hypothesis \( H \).
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- Marginal probability \( P(E) \), the probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given only the personality sketch of Adam and without specific prior probabilities, we'll have to use reasonable assumptions to estimate the likelihoods and priors subjectively.

**For Business Administration:**
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam enrolling in Business Administration (assumed for estimation, say 0.1 due to low matching traits).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of seeing this personality sketch if Adam were in Business Administration (low because the description doesn't match typical traits for this field, estimate 0.1).

**For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam enrolling in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (assumed higher for estimation, say 0.3).
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of seeing this personality sketch if Adam were in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (high because the traits strongly align, estimate 0.8).

For simplicity in the absence of \( P(E) \), we'll assume the total marginal probability sums are normalized. Given the context:

Let's focus mainly on the likelihood ratios:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1 \times 0.1}{M} = 0.01/M \approx 0.05 \) (assuming M normalizes both values),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{M} = 0.24/M \approx 0.8 \)
}

Essentially, Adam's personality traits strongly indicate enrollment in Agricultural and Veterinary Science over Business Administration.

Thus:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
