To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Without specific prior and likelihood values, I can only provide a qualitative estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we will consider the following points:
- His genuine curiosity about nature, appreciation for hard work, empathy, and love for animals suggests a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.
- The traits described do not strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student, who might be expected to exhibit traits such as a focus on leadership, economics, and management rather than a deep love for nature and animals.

Thus, without exact numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates meant to reflect that Adamâ€™s interests and traits are much more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Keep in mind that this approach is based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculation due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood data.
