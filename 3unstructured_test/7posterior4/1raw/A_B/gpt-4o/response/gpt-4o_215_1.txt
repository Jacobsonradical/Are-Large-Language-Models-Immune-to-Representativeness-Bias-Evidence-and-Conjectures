To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given enrollment in each field, and the evidence \( P(E) \).

However, without specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we cannot compute an exact numerical posterior probability. Instead, we can take a qualitative approach to assess the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To qualitatively assess \( P(E|H) \):
- For **business administration** (\(H = \text{business administration}\)): The described personality traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics and interests of someone in business administration. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are not typically associated with this field.
- For **agricultural and veterinary science** (\(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}\)): The described curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly relevant to this field. This field often includes a strong connection to nature and animals, aligning well with Adam's personality.

Given the qualitative assessment, we can reasonably infer the corresponding likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration to be lower than that for agricultural and veterinary science.

Assuming a roughly uniform prior probability \( P(H) \) across different graduate fields of study (i.e., without any prior reason to favor one field over others), the posterior qualitative probabilities can be assessed as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
```

These values are not exact probabilities but a reflection of how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field based on the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods.
