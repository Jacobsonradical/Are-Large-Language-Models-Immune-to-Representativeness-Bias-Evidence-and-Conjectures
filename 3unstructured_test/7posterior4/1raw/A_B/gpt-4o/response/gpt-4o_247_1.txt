To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence \( E \), the prior probability of each hypothesis, and the evidence's normalizing constant.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have concrete prior probabilities or likelihood values from empirical data, we'll have to make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam:

1. Curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals.
4. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: 
   - This field does not inherently align well with a curiosity about nature, plants, or animals.
   - While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, the connection is relatively weaker compared to other fields.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \) is relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - This field aligns strongly with a curiosity about nature, plants, and animals.
   - Empathy and a warm heart also fit well with veterinary science, and intelligence is relevant in understanding complex biological concepts.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \) is relatively high.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \) (prior probability of Business Administration),
- \( P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \) (prior probability of Agricultural and Veterinary Science),
- \( P(E) \) (normalizing constant).

Without concrete data, we simplify by assuming equal priors for simplicity, i.e., \( P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) = P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \). This assumption will normalize out the probabilities if we just compare the likelihoods.

We then estimate:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \approx 0.9 \)

Using these estimates:

\[
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.9"
}
\]

Note that these values are subjective estimates. For accurate computation, actual data on prior probabilities and likelihoods would be required.
