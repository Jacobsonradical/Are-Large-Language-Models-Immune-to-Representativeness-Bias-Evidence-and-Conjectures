To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative estimate based on the personality sketch and reason through which field matches Adam's interests and characteristics more closely.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume there is a moderate chance Adam could be enrolled in this field given that agricultural and veterinary sciences are less common compared to business administration. 
   
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align strongly with this field.
   
    - **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The evidence provided makes it quite likely that Adam is in this field.

2. **Business Administration**

    - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a very common field for graduate students, so let's assume a relatively higher chance initially.
   
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality sketch does not strongly align with qualities typically associated with business administration (such as leadership, networking, strategic planning, etc.). Adam’s interests and characteristics are not a strong match for this field.
   
    - **Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \)**: The likelihood of the evidence makes it less probable that Adam is in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, here is an estimated distribution of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimate reflects that the personality sketch is much more consistent with a field in agricultural and veterinary sciences compared to business administration. Keep in mind these values are qualitative and based on reasonable assumptions given the available information. To obtain precise probabilities, actual data on prior probabilities and likelihoods would be necessary.
