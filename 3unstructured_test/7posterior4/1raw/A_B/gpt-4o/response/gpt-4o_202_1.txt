Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to the prior probability \( P(H) \) multiplied by the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field (business administration or agricultural and veterinary science).

To compute the posterior probabilities, we need:

1. \( P(H) \): the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood of Adam's personality characteristics given his enrollment in each field.
3. \( P(E) \): the total probability of observing Adam's personality characteristics across all fields.

However, precise prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) are not provided in the question. Thus, we will make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and knowledge of typical student characteristics in each field.

Let's estimate:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Generally, many students pursue business administration, so a moderate prior.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Less likely given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Fewer students pursue this field compared to business administration, so a lower prior.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High given Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, and appreciation of hard work.

Given these qualitative assessments:

- Prior for business administration (P(H)): moderate (~0.2)
- Prior for agricultural and veterinary science (P(H)): lower (~0.05)
- Likelihood of personality in business administration (P(E|H)): low (~0.1)
- Likelihood of personality in agricultural and veterinary science (P(E|H)): high (~0.7)

The computed posterior probabilities need to be normalized to obtain relative values, but since we only care about the ratios here, we can just use the product of priors and likelihoods.

### Calculations

For Business Administration:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(H|E) \propto 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

### Normalization (if needed):
\[ P(E) \] is the sum of all numerator terms, but since we are only interested in relative terms:
Normalization factor = 0.02 + 0.035 = 0.055

Final posterior probabilities (scaled):

- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.02}{0.055} \approx 0.36 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.035}{0.055} \approx 0.64 \)

So, the probability estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```

Please note that these values are based on reasonable qualitative estimates. In a real-world scenario, precise priors and likelihoods would provide more accurate probabilities.
