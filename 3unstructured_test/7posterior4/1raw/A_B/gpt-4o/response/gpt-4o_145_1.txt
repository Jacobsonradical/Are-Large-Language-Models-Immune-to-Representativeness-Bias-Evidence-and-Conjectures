To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Hereâ€™s an outline of the needed components:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality traits across all fields. Since we are primarily interested in computing relative probabilities and since no other fields were provided, we can disregard \( P(E) \) in our computation.

Given that we don't have actual numbers for the prior probability \( P(H) \) or the exact \( P(E|H) \), we'll base our estimates on logical interpretation of the personality traits corresponding to each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a relatively balanced prior probability, but since this field is less commonly chosen, we can assume \( P(H) \) is moderate.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality traits such as curiosity about nature, a love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication highly align with this field.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This field is chosen more frequently among graduate students, so a relatively higher prior probability can be assumed.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The personality traits do not directly align well with business administration compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative assessments, we approximate the likelihoods and priors to compute relative probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.25
}

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is more likely he is enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science (75%) compared to business administration (25%).
