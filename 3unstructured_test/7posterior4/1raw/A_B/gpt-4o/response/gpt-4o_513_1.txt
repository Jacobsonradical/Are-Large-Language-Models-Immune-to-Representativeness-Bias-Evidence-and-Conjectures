To provide the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in a certain field given his personality sketch), we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we are not given explicit values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we will make educated estimates based on Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and his intelligence with an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is reasonable to estimate the following:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: High. Adam's traits align well with those needed for agricultural and veterinary science programs.
- **P(H)**: Moderately common. This field has a reasonable representation among graduate students interested in nature and animals.

### Business Administration
- **P(E|H)**: Low. While intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his interests in nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy, are less aligned with business administration.
- **P(H)**: Very common. Business administration is a popular field, but this does not strongly influence Adam's characteristics.

Providing reasoned estimates for the probabilities, we can assess the relative likelihoods.

Based on the estimates:
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \), and \( P(H) = 0.2 \).
- For **business administration**, let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \), and \( P(H) = 0.3 \).

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both and not provided, it does not affect the ratio:

### Posterior Probabilities (relative values)
Based on the qualitative assessments, the scaled posterior probabilities would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * 0.2 ≈ 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.1 * 0.3 ≈ 0.03,
}

We can conclude:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
```

These values reflect our qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch of Adam relative to each field.
