To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, since we don't have specific data on these values, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, let's assume that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for the fields are equal because we lack specific information to weight them differently. Therefore, \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields. The posterior probabilities will then be primarily influenced by the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

From the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer the following likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants (high likelihood).
   - He has a deep love for animals (very high likelihood).

\[
P(E|H) \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science} \approx 0.9
\]

2. **Business Administration**:
   - A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles (moderate likelihood).
   - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts (some relevance, but not specific to business more than other fields).
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication (relevant, but not significantly impacting likelihood for business more than other fields).

\[
P(E|H) \text{ for Business Administration} \approx 0.3
\]

Given that \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields and denoting constants appropriately for normalization, the more influential factors are the likelihoods. Therefore, after normalizing the numbers for simplicity in comparison, let's assign values accordingly:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}

This indicates that based on the personality sketch, Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration.
