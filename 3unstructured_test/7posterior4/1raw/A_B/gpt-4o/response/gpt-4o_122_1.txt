To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in a specific field before considering the personality sketch.

2. **Determine Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability that the personality sketch fits someone who is enrolled in the specific field.

3. **Determine Total Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the personality sketch regardless of the field.

4. **Apply Bayes' Rule**: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   
Given the subjective nature of personality and field alignment, exact numeric values would typically derive from empirical data, but I'll provide approximate reasoning to deduce the probabilities in this context.

### Reasoning

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity because we don't have specific information on the distribution of graduate students across fields.
   - Let’s assume \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.5 \)
   - Let’s assume \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **P(E | business administration)**: Business administration students might have traits like high intelligence and strong understanding of hard work, but empathy for nature and animals might be less common.
   - **P(E | agricultural and veterinary science)**: Students in these fields are often empathetic towards nature and animals, interested in plants, and may enjoy solving practical problems.

Given that Adam’s characteristics align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science:

   - Let’s assume \( P(E | \text{business administration}) = 0.1 \)
   - Let’s assume \( P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Total Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - We calculate \( P(E) \) based on the marginal likelihood:
   
\[ 
P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \times P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \times P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) 
\]
   
\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.5) + (0.9 \times 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.45 = 0.5
\]

4. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Rule**:

- For business administration:

\[ 
P(\text{business administration} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \times P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.1 
\]

- For agricultural and veterinary science:

\[ 
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \times P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)}= \frac{0.9 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.9 
\]

### Result

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}
