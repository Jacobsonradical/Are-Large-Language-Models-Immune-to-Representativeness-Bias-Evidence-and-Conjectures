To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the prior probability of the evidence.

However, without access to specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \), we can only provide subjective estimates based on how strongly Adam's personality traits align with each field. 

Let's make reasonable subjective estimates based on Adam's personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, it seems highly likely that he would be interested in this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be high.

- **Business administration**: Adam's personality traits such as warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals do not align as closely with business administration, which is more focused on management, finance, and economics. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively lower.

Given this qualitative assessment, we might estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are subjective and based on the alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the typical traits and interests of people in each field.
