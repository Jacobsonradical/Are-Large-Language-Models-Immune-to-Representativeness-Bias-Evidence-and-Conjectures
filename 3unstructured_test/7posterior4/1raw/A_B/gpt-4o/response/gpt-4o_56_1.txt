To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). However, since we don’t have specific numerical values and exact distributions, I'll describe qualitatively how these probabilities might be informally derived based on the given information and typical distributions.

Bayes’ rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific prior probabilities, we will estimate qualitaritively:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) for each field**:
   - Without specific data, we can assume typical enrollment figures. Business administration tends to have a higher enrollment rate compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For business administration: Given Adam's personality sketch, his traits (love for nature, empathy, high intelligence, interest in animals) slightly mismatch typical traits associated with business administration students but it is not entirely uncommon.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's traits seem well aligned with someone in this field. His empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work match very well with what is expected in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   - Without precise data, we cannot calculate this exactly. However, we can assume it's constant for both conditions since it normalizes over all possible hypotheses.

Based on the qualitative assessment, the posterior probabilities can be informally estimated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect a higher alignment of Adam's personality with agricultural and veterinary science, and a lower but not impossible fit with business administration. Note that these are not exact probabilities but should give a proportional sense based on the given personality sketch.
