To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will try to evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, without concrete data, we need to make reasonable assumptions.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, his love for animals, and empathy, these traits strongly align with someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Lets assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) do not align as strongly with a typical profile for business administration, which may be focused more on organizational and economic competencies.
   - Lets assume \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is relatively low.

Next, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field. These priors could be based on the popularity or general enrollment numbers for graduate students in the U.S. Typically, business administration programs have a large number of enrollments compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences, but this does not necessarily mean Adam is in one of them, due to the specifics of his personality sketch.

For simplicity, let's assume these priors intuitively:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \) 
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)

Now, the evidence \(P(E)\) is a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 across all fields. Since we're requested to just provide the probabilities for these two fields without an exhaustive list of fields, we can omit its explicit calculation.

Also, given the limited scope, let's use simplified estimates of the likelihoods based on the subjective evaluation:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood, given Adam's traits)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood, given Adam's traits)

Using Bayes' rule:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) appears in both denomintors, it just needs to normalize the two probabilities, simplifying our comparison. Thus we focus on numerators:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.08",
  "business administration": "0.04"
}

These values are not exact but reflect the relative strength of the likelihood based on the personality sketch and priors.
