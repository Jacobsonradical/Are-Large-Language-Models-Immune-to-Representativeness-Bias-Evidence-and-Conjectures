To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' Rule: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability — the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood — the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability — the initial probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood — the total probability of the evidence.

However, without exact numerical probabilities for each of these terms (which are rarely provided), we can rely on the strengths of qualitative evidence to suggest relative probabilities.

Given Adam's personality sketch: a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's plausible to infer that:

1. \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \) is relatively high, since these traits align well with interests and skills pertinent to agricultural and veterinary science. 
2. \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \) is relatively lower, as the traits listed are not strongly indicative of a passion or skill set aligned with business administration.

We can make reasonable assumptions based on common contexts:

- Prior probabilities \( P(H_{business\ administration}) \) and \( P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \) might start from general enrollment ratios.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) would be higher for fields closely related to Adam's interests.

Assuming similar prior probabilities for graduate students in both fields, the posterior will be strongly influenced by the likelihoods derived from Adam's personality traits.

So the posterior probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect qualitative estimates where the emphasis on Adam's nature-focused traits strongly supports a hypothesis favoring agricultural and veterinary science over business administration.
