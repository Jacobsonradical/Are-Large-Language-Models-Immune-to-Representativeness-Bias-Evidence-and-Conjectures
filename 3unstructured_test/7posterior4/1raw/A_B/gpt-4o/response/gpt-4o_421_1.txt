To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider how well the personality sketch (E) matches each hypothesis (H). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are not given explicit prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the sketch provided. These assumptions will be qualitative rather than quantitative.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - The personality sketch describes Adam as someone with curiosity about nature, love for animals, high empathy, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits are not typically the primary characteristics sought after in business administration, although they do not preclude it.
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Relatively low, as the traits listed are not closely related to business administration.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Neutral assumption, let's say average likelihood among graduate fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - The sketch shows that Adam has a deep love for animals, a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, and a curiosity about nature, which fits well with this field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, as the traits closely match what is expected in this field.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Higher than average given the nature-related interests and love for animals.

Given these qualitative assumptions, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values, though not computed numerically, reflect that Adam is more likely to be in the agricultural and veterinary science field than in business administration based on the provided personality sketch.
