To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we can express it as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch (E) given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (E).

Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we can reason qualitatively based on the information given and approximate the values.

For agricultural and veterinary science:
- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy, it is quite likely that the personality sketch (E) matches someone in this field.
- P(E|H) is high.

For business administration:
- Although someone in business administration can be intelligent and good at abstract concepts, this field does not align as strongly with Adam's love for nature, animals, and puzzles.
- P(E|H) is lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Assuming prior probabilities, P(H), for graduate fields are roughly equal (since we don't have specific data on their likelihood), and recognizing that P(E) (the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch) is a constant for all calculations, we primarily need to focus on the likelihoods P(E|H).

Let's estimate these:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science:
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.8 (since the personality sketch strongly matches this field)
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1 (assuming moderate representation among graduate fields)
   - P(E) is constant across fields, so it does not need to be quantified exactly.

2. Business administration:
   - P(E|H) ≈ 0.2 (since the personality sketch less strongly matches this field)
   - P(H) ≈ 0.1 (assuming moderate representation among graduate fields)
   - Again, P(E) is constant across fields, so it does not need to be quantified exactly.

Given these qualitative estimates, we can present the relative probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values indicate that based on Adam's personality sketch, it is much more likely that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
