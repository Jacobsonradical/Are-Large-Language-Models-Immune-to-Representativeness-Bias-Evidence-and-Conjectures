Applying Bayes' rule for this scenario involves a few steps. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits each field.

### 1. Business Administration:
- Nature Curiosity: Not typically associated with business.
- Solving Puzzles: Possible, as strategic thinking is useful in business.
- Warm Heart & Empathy: Beneficial for leadership roles.
- Love for Animals: Unrelated.
- Intelligence & Abstract Concepts: Relevant to business theory.
- Hard Work & Dedication: Common across most fields, including business.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Nature Curiosity: Highly relevant.
- Solving Puzzles: Useful in scientific research.
- Warm Heart & Empathy: Essential for animal-related work.
- Love for Animals: Directly related.
- Intelligence & Abstract Concepts: Useful in scientific inquiry.
- Hard Work & Dedication: Critical in science fields.

Based on these qualitative matches, Adamâ€™s personality sketch aligns more strongly with Agricultural and Veterinary Science than with Business Administration.

Therefore, the posterior estimates might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 
}
```

These probabilities are somewhat subjective but are structured to reflect the closer alignment of Adam's traits with the latter field. Adjustments can be made with more specific data.
