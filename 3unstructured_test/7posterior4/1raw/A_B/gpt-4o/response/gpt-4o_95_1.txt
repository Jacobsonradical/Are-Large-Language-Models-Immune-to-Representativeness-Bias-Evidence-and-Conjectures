To compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \(E\).

Given the nature of this personality sketch (E), we will make educated guesses on the prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \(P(H_{AVS})\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): The likelihood of Adam having such characteristics given he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \(P(H_{BA})\): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
   - \(P(E|H_{BA})\): The likelihood of Adam having such characteristics given he was enrolled in business administration.

We can assume the following reasonable estimates:
- \(P(E)\) is the same across all fields and does not need to be explicitly calculated as we are only focusing on the relative probabilities.

### Hypothesis: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Since Adam has a strong curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work that aligns well with this field:
- \(P(H_{AVS})\): Say 0.10 (more popular than business for this personality).
- \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): Say 0.70 because his traits strongly align with those needed in this field.

### Hypothesis: Business Administration
Adam's traits don't align as well with business administration, but there's always a chance:
- \(P(H_{BA})\): Say 0.20 (a relatively popular field).
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Say 0.05 because his traits don't align well with typical business characteristics.

With these estimates, using a simplified Bayes' rule without the marginal probability \(P(E)\) (since we're comparing relative probabilities):

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]

Calculations:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.05 \cdot 0.20 = 0.01 \]

Normalizing can be ignored for relative comparison:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
