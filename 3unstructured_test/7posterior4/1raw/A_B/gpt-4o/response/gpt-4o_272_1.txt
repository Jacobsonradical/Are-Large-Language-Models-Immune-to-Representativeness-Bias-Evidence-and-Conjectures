To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. The prior probability \( P(H) \): the initial probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for each probability, we need to make some assumptions to provide an approximation based on the given information.

### Assume the following:
1. \( P(H) \): Priors can be assumed to be the general probability of students enrolling in each field.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Likelihoods can be judged based on how well the personality sketch fits each field.

#### Hypothesis 1: Business Administration
- **P(E|H)**: Unlikely; Business Administration students are less likely to fit the profile of a quiet person with a deep love for nature and animals.
- **P(H)**: Graduates in Business Administration are common.
- **P(H|E)**: Low because the evidence does not strongly support this field.

#### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(E|H)**: Highly likely; This field strongly aligns with the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy).
- **P(H)**: Fewer students may enroll compared to Business Administration, but it's still a valid field.
- **P(H|E)**: High because the evidence strongly supports this field.

Given our qualitative assessments:
\[ 
P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \gg P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}})
\]

### Approximate Posterior Probabilities:
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}

These values represent the relative posterior probabilities. The exact numbers are illustrative and would be more accurate with specific prior and likelihood values.
