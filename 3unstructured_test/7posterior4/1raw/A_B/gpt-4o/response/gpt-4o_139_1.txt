To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the nature of the personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate value, say 0.3, because this is one of many possible fields.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits described are not particularly aligned with business administration, so assume a low value, e.g., 0.1.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Assume a similarly moderate value, say 0.3.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The personality traits are strongly aligned with this field, so assume a high value, e.g., 0.7.

The total probability \( P(E) \) can be ignored in this relative comparison because it will be the same for both fields. Thus, the calculations simplify to comparing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

So, we get:

{
  "business administration": \( 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( 0.7 \times 0.3 = 0.21 \)
}

Given the relative values:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.21
}
```
