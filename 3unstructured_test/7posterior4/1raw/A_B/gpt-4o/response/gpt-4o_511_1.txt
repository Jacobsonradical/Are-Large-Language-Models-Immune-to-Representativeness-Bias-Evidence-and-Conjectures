To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need the probabilities of \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and the general probability \( P(E) \). However, without specific numerical data for these probabilities, we can make educated assumptions based on the given personality sketch and the likely relevance to each field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the nature of Adam's interests and traits, we can infer the following:

1. **P(E|H) for Business Administration**: Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not particularly aligned with a typical profile for a business administration student. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is likely to be low.

2. **P(E|H) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's fascination with plants and animals, along with his empathy and understanding of hard work, aligns well with this field. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is likely high.

3. **P(H)**: Without specific priors, we might assume that the likelihood of a student being in either field is somewhat even, but let's assume agricultural sciences are less common, thus \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) > P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \).

4. **P(E)**: This is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields and remains a constant normalizing factor.

While we cannot calculate exact probabilities without real data, we can make reasoned qualitative assessments. Given:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]

We'll use educated hypothetical values for these probabilities to derive the conclusion:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the assumption that Adam's personality traits and interests strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
