To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for both fields using Bayes' rule, we need:

1. **Prior probabilities** \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in each field, without considering Adam's personality.
2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in each field.

Bayes' rule is stated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are only providing relative probabilities and are not normalizing them across all fields, we will focus on the numerators: \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Assume some logical reasoning and estimation based on the provided personality sketch:

### Business Administration
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business Administration is a common field, so let’s assume a moderate prior probability of 0.2.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The traits given in Adam’s personality sketch (love for nature, animals, quietness, puzzle-solving) are less commonly associated with Business Administration. Let's estimate this likelihood at 0.1.

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common than business but quite relevant to Adam’s traits. Let’s assume a prior of 0.05.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s traits very strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals). We can estimate this likelihood at 0.9.

\[ P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \times 0.05 = 0.045 \]

So, we can summarize as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.02,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045
}
```

These numbers reflect the relative strength of the hypothesis given Adam's personality sketch but are not absolute probabilities.
