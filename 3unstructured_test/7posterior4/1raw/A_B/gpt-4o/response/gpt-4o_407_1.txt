Bayes' rule states that \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Since we are not given specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, we need to make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch and common sense. 

The personality sketch includes:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication
- Enjoys solving puzzles

Given these attributes, here is an estimation for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(E|H) is likely to be high because the subject's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns closely with this field. Additionally, empathy and a strong appreciation for hard work are essential in this discipline.
   - P(H) can be assumed to be moderate given that this is a specific and well-defined area of study.
  
2. **Business Administration**
   - P(E|H) is likely to be lower because the subject's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with typical attributes required for business administration. The subject's appreciation for nature and animals is less relevant to this field.
   - P(H) would generally be high as business administration is a common field of study, but given the subject's personality traits, it's less likely.

Without exact numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we can still provide a qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science based on the provided personality sketch, while recognizing that other fields could also be relevant.
