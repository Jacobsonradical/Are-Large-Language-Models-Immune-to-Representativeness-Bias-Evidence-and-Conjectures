To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) for each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this scenario, we do not have explicit data on the prior probabilities or the likelihood terms. Therefore, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided in Adam's personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H))**:
   - Let's assume Adam had an equal chance of enrolling in any graduate field, as specific prior probabilities are not given.
  
2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H))**:
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, it's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - For **business administration**: Since business administration may not strongly align with his described interests (nature, animals, solving puzzles), although his high intelligence could be a factor, we consider \( P(E|H) \) to be lower.

### Rough Estimates:
- \( P(E) \) is the same for both fields and can act as a normalizing factor.

Given these assumptions:

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): High (Let's assume 0.75)
  - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.5 since we have no other prior data

- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \): Low (Let's assume 0.10)
  - \( P(H) \): Let's assume 0.5 as before

So, we can use these likelihoods and priors to make a rough comparative interpretation:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.75 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the normalization term, we can compare the numerators directly:

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**: \( 0.75 \times 0.5 = 0.375 \)
- For **business administration**: \( 0.10 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \)

These values show the relative probabilities.

### Final Conditional Probabilities:
Given we can't compute the exact probabilities without \( P(E) \), we'll provide the relative values.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These values reflect the likelihoods based on the provided information, indicating a higher probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration given his personality sketch.
