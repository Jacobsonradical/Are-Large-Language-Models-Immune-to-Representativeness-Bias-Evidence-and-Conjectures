To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we follow the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Given that we do not have specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) for business administration and agricultural/veterinary science, we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone who is curious about nature, enjoys puzzles, has a warm heart and empathy, and loves animals, etc., is enrolled in business administration might be relatively low.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be moderate but not exceptionally high for someone matching Adam's profile.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that someone with Adam's attributes and interests is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability is also reasonable, if not significantly high, given Adam's love for nature and animals.

Based on these qualitative insights, we can make an educated guess on their posterior probabilities:

\[
P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \text{ is low}; \quad P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \text{ might be moderate};
\]
\[
P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \text{ is high}; \quad P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \text{ is moderate to high}.
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities might reasonably be approximated as follows:

\[
\begin{cases}
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.1 \\
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.7 
\end{cases}
\]

Here's the formatted answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
