Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have the exact values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the evidence \( P(E) \). Instead, we can qualitatively infer these probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch. For simplicity, let's make some educated guesses based on the information provided. 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, his interests align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

For business administration, the alignment with Adam's characteristics (e.g., a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles, deep love for animals) seems less direct. Hence, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is likely lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assign some qualitative probabilities based on this reasoning:

1. For business administration: Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical characteristics one might expect in this field. We'll assign a lower likelihood.
2. For agricultural and veterinary science: Adam's interest in nature and animals aligns well with this field. We'll assign a higher likelihood.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

These values are heuristic and represent our qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.
