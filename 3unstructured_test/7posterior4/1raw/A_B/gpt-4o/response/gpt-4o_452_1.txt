To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Since we don't have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, let's make qualitative inferences based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a strong empathy, a love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature, which may not strongly align with business administration.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \) is relatively low given the personality traits.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and empathy strongly align with this field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \) is relatively high.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's assign illustrative conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are based on the intuitive alignment between Adam's traits and the described fields, without precise data.
