In order to compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as prior probabilities and likelihoods, which are not provided in your query. Let's proceed with reasonable assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the graduate fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited data, we need to make reasonable assumptions and adjust for those fields.

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: 
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, given Adam's strong empathy towards animals, love for nature, and appreciation for diligence, it seems highly likely.
   - For **business administration**, while Adam's intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts might be helpful, there's no specific personality trait pointing directly to this field.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - We assume that these fields have some baseline prior probabilities based on general enrollment statistics, but since we're not given specific numbers, we'll assume equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for simplicity here.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   - This represents how probable it is to have Adamâ€™s personality traits among the general population of graduate students, but given our lack of data here, we can consider it a normalizing constant.

Given these considerations, let's assign tentative values based on qualitative reasoning:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, let's assume 0.8
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Moderate, let's assume 0.2
- \( P(H) \): Equal for both, but could be more specialized if given data.

Plugging these assumptions into Bayes' rule, and remembering the normalization across the specific fields is not necessary, we get:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.8
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.2
\]

So, we can express the result as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values are not exact probabilities but rather reflect the relative likelihood based on the provided personality sketch and reasonable assumptions.
