To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given the provided personality sketch.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we will need to make some reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with the fields of study and the personality traits given. We will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

1. **business administration**:
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that someone studying business administration has a deep love for animals, empathy, enjoys solving puzzles, and has a genuine curiosity about nature is relatively low.
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. studying business administration is relatively moderate, as business administration programs are quite common.
   - \(P(E)\): The overall probability of the personality sketch is not specific to any one field, so let's assume a moderate constant.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(E|H)\cdot P(H) \implies \text{low likelihood} \times \text{moderate prior} = \text{low to very low posterior} \]

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood that someone studying agricultural and veterinary science has a love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and understanding for hard work is quite high.
   - \(P(H)\): The prior probability of a graduate student in the U.S. studying agricultural and veterinary science is lower relative to more common fields like business administration.
   - \(P(E)\): The overall probability of the personality sketch remains constant.

Given these considerations:
\[ P(E|H)\cdot P(H) \implies \text{high likelihood} \times \text{lower prior} = \text{moderate to high posterior} \]

Given the qualitative reasoning, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect that the likelihood of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher given his personality traits than him being in business administration.
