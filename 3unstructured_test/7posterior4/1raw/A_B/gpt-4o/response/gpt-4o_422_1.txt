To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field H given his personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits E given that Adam is enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality traits E.

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the marginal probability \( P(E) \), we can reason qualitatively to provide a heuristic estimation.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **High Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: This field likely has a moderate-to-high prior probability given that many students might be enrolled in it.
- **High Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: The description of Adam's interests and personality aligns well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

### Business Administration

- **Moderate Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Business administration typically attracts many students, so it has a moderate-to-high prior probability.
- **Low Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: Adam's personality sketch is less characteristic of the typical traits expected for someone in business administration, which usually involves more focus on economics, management, and less on nature and animals.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the heuristic estimations for the posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,  // Adam's personality traits match well with this field.
  "business administration": 0.2  // While possible, it is less likely given his traits.
}

These values are heuristic and intended to reflect the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality and the fields in question based on common tendencies.
