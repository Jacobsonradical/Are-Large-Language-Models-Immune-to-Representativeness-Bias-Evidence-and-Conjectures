To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihoods and the priors of the hypotheses. However, because we don't have explicit data for the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide a qualitative reasoning to approximate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values, we can estimate the probabilities based on how well Adam's personality sketch (E) aligns with typical students in each field (H).

For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- These attributes strongly align with this field.

For "business administration":
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence.
- However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for nature and animals do not strongly align with the typical traits and interests associated with business administration.

Based on this qualitative assessment, let's reasonably estimate the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These estimates reflect the idea that Adam's personality traits and interests are much more aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.
