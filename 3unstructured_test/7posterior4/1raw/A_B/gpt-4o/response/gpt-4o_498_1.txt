To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the personality traits \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). However, since we're not provided with specific numerical values for priors or likelihoods, we will make reasoned assumptions based on the given information.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior probability** \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume the general probability of a graduate student being in business administration is relatively common but not exceedingly high in comparison to other fields.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The likelihood of having traits like empathy, a love for animals, and curiosity about nature is relatively less common in business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior probability** \( P(H_{AVS}) \): The probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than more popular fields like business administration.
   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The likelihood of having traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and a love for animals is quite high in this field.

To express this formally without exact numerical values:

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which is a normalizing constant.

Given the qualitative nature of the data and our assumptions, the probabilities can be comparatively expressed:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are illustrative to show that based on the personality sketch, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. Note that the actual numerical values might differ if we had empirical data on priors and likelihoods.
