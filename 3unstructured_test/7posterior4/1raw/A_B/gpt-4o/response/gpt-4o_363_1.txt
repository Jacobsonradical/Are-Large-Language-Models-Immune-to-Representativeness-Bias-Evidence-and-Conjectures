To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given fields, the following equation can be used:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have the exact values for these probabilities, we will use a qualitative approach to estimate them based on the available information.

Here's our qualitative analysis:

### For Business Administration:
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits described (e.g. curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) are less characteristic of a typical business administration student. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low.
- **P(H)**: Given the large number of business students, the prior probability of Adam being in a business administration program could be moderate to high.
  
### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **P(E|H)**: The personality traits strongly align with attributes beneficial in agricultural and veterinary sciences, such as a love for animals and nature, and empathy. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
- **P(H)**: The number of students in agricultural and veterinary sciences is generally lower compared to business administration, so the prior probability might be lower, but still significant given Adam's traits.

### Estimated values:
For the purposes of this exercise, letâ€™s assign some indicative values based on these considerations:
- **P(E|H_business)**: 0.2
- **P(E|H_agricultural)**: 0.8
- **P(H_business)**: 0.3
- **P(H_agricultural)**: 0.1

\( P(E) \) acts as a normalizing constant, not defined by the specific hypotheses tested, and can be disregarded for comparative purposes here.

Using these qualitative considerations, the resulting values can be roughly estimated as:
  
```json
{
  "business administration": "0.07",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.32"
}
```

To put this in a matching format to our approach:

- We look at the higher posterior under agricultural and veterinary science given the overlap with Adam's traits.

Here is the final answer format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods that Adam is enrolled in these fields given his personality sketch. Note that these are rough estimations and could be different with precise data.
