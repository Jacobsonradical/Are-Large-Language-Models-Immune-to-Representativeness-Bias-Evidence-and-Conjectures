To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), as well as the prior probabilities of each hypothesis and the overall evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To proceed with this exercise, we need to make some assumptions about the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Let's consider:
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the given personality sketch if Adam is in a specific field of study.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of the personality sketch overall. Since this is common across both hypotheses, it will normalize the results but can be ignored for comparing relative probabilities.

Given Adam's traits, it's reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is much higher for agricultural and veterinary science than for business administration due to his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy and love for animals.

Let's assume indicative values for the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

For the priors, let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.2 \) (assuming fewer people enroll in agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \) (assuming more people enroll in business administration)

Using Bayes' rule, we have:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

Computing these:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

Now, let's represent these values as normalized (itâ€™s not required to normalize, but it helps understanding the relative likelihood):
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.17} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.17} \]

Here is the final representation:
{
  "business administration": "0.176 (approximately 0.03 / 0.17)",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.824 (approximately 0.14 / 0.17)"
}

However, the format provided specifically does not require normalization. Therefore, the non-normalized posterior probabilities are given:

{
  "business administration": "0.03",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.14"
}
