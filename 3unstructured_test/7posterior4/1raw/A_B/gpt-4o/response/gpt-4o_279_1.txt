To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior knowledge about the distributions and likelihoods involved. Bayes' rule is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that hypothesis \( H \) is true given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \) under all hypotheses.

Since we're lacking concrete numerical prior probabilities and likelihood values, we will need to make educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions

1. **Business Administration**: The personality traits such as having a strong understanding, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work could fit a business administration student. However, the traits like genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and strong empathy are less commonly associated with this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work are strongly indicative of a student in agricultural and veterinary science. The high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts also support this field.

### Estimation

#### Business Administration

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Moderate, as some traits can be associated with this field, but not all.
2. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \)**: Moderate, as many students could be in business administration.
3. **Posterior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \)**: Moderate to low because the personality sketch is not strongly indicative.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: High, as most traits align very well with someone in this field.
2. **Prior \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \)**: Reasonable, as there are students in this field.
3. **Posterior \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \)**: High, because of the strong alignment of personality traits.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate the posterior probabilities based on the Bayesian approach without specific numeric values but using relative reasoning. 

Let's put these estimates in the required format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are relatively subjective but are informed by the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical characteristics expected in these fields.
