Bayes' Rule can be used to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for a hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \). It is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's how we would approach this problem:

1. **Establishing Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - We need some prior knowledge about the likelihood of a graduate student enrolling in each of these fields. Without specific statistics, we can assume equal priors or use general enrollment statistics if available. For simulation purposes, let's assume the following rough priors based on general intuition:
     - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.05 \) (5%)
     - **Business administration**: \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.15 \) (15%)

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This represents how likely we observe \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch) given each field \( H \).
     - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
       - Given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals, it is likely he fits well into agricultural and veterinary science.
       - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.9 \) (90%)
     - For **business administration**:
       - Business administration may capitalize more on strategic thinking and leadership rather than empathy and love for nature/animals.
       - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.2 \) (20%)

3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the normalization factor and can be calculated as:
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) + P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}}) + \text{(contributions from other hypotheses)} \]

     Simplifying by assuming only these two fields (although others exist):
     \[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15) \]

4. **Calculate Posterior Probabilities**:
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
     \[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.05}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15)} \]
     \[ P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) = \frac{0.045}{0.045 + 0.03} = \frac{0.045}{0.075} = 0.6 \]

   - For **business administration**:
     \[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.15}{(0.9 \times 0.05) + (0.2 \times 0.15)} \]
     \[ P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.045 + 0.03} = \frac{0.03}{0.075} = 0.4 \]
