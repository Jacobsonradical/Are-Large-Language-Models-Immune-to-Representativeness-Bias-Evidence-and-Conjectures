To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to express this as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having his described personality given he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam having his described personality, regardless of the field of study.

Given the nature of the sketch, common sense assumptions about the fields, and a qualitative estimate (since we don't have specific data), we can infer:

1. **For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high since Adam has a love for nature, plants, and animals, aligning well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is not extraordinarily common but plausible for someone with his interests.

2. **For Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low since his interests don't strongly align with typical traits for business administration (e.g., interests in finance, leadership, management).
   - \( P(H) \) for business administration is relatively common in general but doesn't particularly fit Adam's personality sketch.

Using qualitative estimates:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.8 (high due to alignment of interests), and let's assume \( P(H) \) around 0.05 (since itâ€™s not a huge field but plausible).
- For Business Administration: \( P(E|H) \) might be around 0.2 (low due to mismatch of interests), and let's assume \( P(H) \) around 0.15 (more common field).

Now transforming these qualitative estimates into posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule (without exact numbers for \( P(E) \)):

Since \( P(E) \) is constant, we will calculate the numerator and use it as a relative probability.

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.05 = 0.04 \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Comparing these relative numbers:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.03) = 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.03 / (0.04 + 0.03) = 0.43
}

Since exact probabilities are complex without detailed data, these relative comparisons provide an educated guess. Here are rounded posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.57",
  "business administration": "0.43"
}
