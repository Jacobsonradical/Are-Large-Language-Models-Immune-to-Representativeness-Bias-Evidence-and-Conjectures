To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to make a few assumptions and simplify our approach given we don't have specific numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods. Bayes' rule is:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since we are looking for qualitative answers rather than precise numerical values, we can leverage the intuitive fit between Adam's personality sketch and the assumed characteristics of students in each field. Let's use this qualitative assessment to estimate the probabilities.

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's characteristics given he is in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \): The base rate or prior probability of students being in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics, which can be considered constant across fields for the purpose of comparative assessment.

### Assumptions:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Students are generally inclined towards leadership, management, financial analysis, and strategic thinking. Curiosity about nature and animals may not be a predominant trait.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Likelihood of nature curiosity, love for animals, and empathy fitting a business administration student is relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Students typically have a strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and may have a high degree of empathy and a warm heart.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): Likelihood is high as these traits align closely with the field's characteristics.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can estimate:

\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \text{Low} \quad \text{(closer to 0)}
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \text{High} \quad \text{(closer to 1)}
\]

### Estimated Posterior Probabilities:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

For simplification, assuming equal prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (since we don't know otherwise) and focusing on \( P(E|H) \):

\[
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
\]

These values are illustrative and demonstrate a much higher qualitative alignment between Adam's characteristics and the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science compared to Business Administration. Hence, Adam is much more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science than in Business Administration based on the given personality sketch.
