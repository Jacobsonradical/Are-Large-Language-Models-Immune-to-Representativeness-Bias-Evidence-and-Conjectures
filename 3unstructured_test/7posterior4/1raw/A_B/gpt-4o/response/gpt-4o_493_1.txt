To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate the following:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of being in each field, without knowing anything about Adam's personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in each field.
3. **Normalization Constant \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch, regardless of the field.

However, due to the lack of detailed statistics and priors about graduate students in specific fields, we'll rely on qualitative reasoning based on the given personality sketch.

### Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals. This aligns closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be relatively high.
  
- **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits, such as a quiet demeanor, empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, don't strongly suggest a natural fit for business administration. This doesn't mean it’s impossible, but the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be relatively lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Bayesian Estimates:
Given these qualitative assessments, we assign and normalize rough probability values based on the subjective analysis of Adam's personality traits.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - High prior since there is a strong alignment with Adam's interests and traits.
   - Let's assume: \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.4 \)
   - Higher likelihood of observing Adam’s traits in this field.
   - Let's assign: \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.9 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Lower prior because his traits don't align as closely with the typical traits associated with business administration.
   - Let's assume: \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
   - Lower likelihood of observing Adam’s traits in this field.
   - Let's assign: \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) (the normalization factor) is equal to:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + \ldots \]

For simplicity, we'll consider only these two fields and normalize only over these.

Let's denote:
- \( P(E) \approx (0.9 \cdot 0.4) + (0.3 \cdot 0.2) \)
- \( P(E) \approx 0.36 + 0.06 = 0.42 \)

Then compute:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.4}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.36}{0.42} \approx 0.857 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.2}{0.42} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143 \]

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.857,
  "business administration": 0.143
}
```
