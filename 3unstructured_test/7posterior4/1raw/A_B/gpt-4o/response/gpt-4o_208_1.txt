To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given no specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we must rely on the provided personality sketch to form some reasonable assumptions. Since exact numerical values are not given, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the described traits.

- **Adam's traits that pertain to agricultural and veterinary science (H1):**
  - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
  - Deep love for animals.
  - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  - All these characteristics align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

- **Adam's traits that pertain to business administration (H2):**
  - High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
  - Appreciation for hard work and dedication.
  - While these traits are valuable in business, they are not as distinctively aligned with business administration as they are with agricultural and veterinary science.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is likely higher than in business administration based on the given personality sketch.

Given no quantitative data, we'll provide reasonable qualitative assessments:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{P(agricultural and veterinary science | E)} & \approx 0.75 \\
\text{P(business administration | E)} & \approx 0.25 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}
```

These values express that based on the information provided, it is more likely for Adam to have been enrolled in a graduate program related to agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.
