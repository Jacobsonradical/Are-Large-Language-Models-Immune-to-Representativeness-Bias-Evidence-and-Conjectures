To use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, since I don't have exact data on the priors and likelihoods, I'll make reasonable qualitative hypotheses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \): The personality sketch of Adam.

Given the description in the sketch, here are some qualitative assessments:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy significantly align with the traits generally found in someone likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts can be seen as applicable to many fields, including business administration, but it doesn't strongly signal an inclination towards business administration.

Let's try to estimate the posterior probabilities qualitatively.

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given the traits of curiosity about nature and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E | H_1) \) is comparatively high.
2. **Business administration**: With traits like high intelligence and abstract thinking aligning but fewer direct connections to the core interests (nature, animals), the likelihood \( P(E | H_2) \) is comparatively lower.

Given these qualitative insights, here is my estimation for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values are not obtained from exact calculations but are inferred from a qualitative understanding of how Adam's personality traits align with the fields mentioned. For more precise results, exact prior probabilities and likelihoods would be necessary.
