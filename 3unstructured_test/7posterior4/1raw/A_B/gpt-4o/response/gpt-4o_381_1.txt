To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we will need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of each field (we assume equal probabilities if unspecified).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence, which acts as a normalization factor.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

Let's assume that all fields of graduate study are equally likely initially (i.e., \( P(H) \) is the same for both fields).

Given the personality sketch, we need to qualitatively assess how likely his traits are under each field. Here are qualitative assessments for each \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Less relevant.
   - **Solving puzzles:** Moderately relevant.
   - **Empathy and love for animals:** Not typically associated.
   - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Moderately relevant.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Relevant.
   
   Overall, the fit seems moderate but not very strong.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Curiosity about nature and plants:** Highly relevant.
   - **Solving puzzles:** Relevant.
   - **Empathy and love for animals:** Highly relevant.
   - **High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts:** Relevant.
   - **Appreciation for hard work and dedication:** Highly relevant.

   Overall, the fit seems very strong.

Given these qualitative assessments, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is higher than for business administration.

Now, let's assign probability values to these assessments. Here are reasonable approximations:

- \( P(E|H = \text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)

In real scenarios, \( P(E) \) sums over all competing hypotheses but is not necessary for the relative comparison between the two.

Given the above and assuming equal priors:

\[ \frac{P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E)}{P(H = \text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{P(E|H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E|H = \text{business administration}) \cdot P(H = \text{business administration})} \]

Since \( P(H) \) for both fields initially assumed equal and cancels out:

\[ \frac{P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E)}{P(H = \text{business administration}|E)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

This implies \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \) is about 4 times more likely than \( P(H = \text{business administration}|E) \). For easier interpretation, normalize these to make the posterior conditional probabilities more intuitive:

- Assume proportions sum to 1:
  - \( P(H = \text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{1}{1+4} = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{4}{1+4} = 0.8 \)

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```
These values are estimates based on the given qualitative information.
