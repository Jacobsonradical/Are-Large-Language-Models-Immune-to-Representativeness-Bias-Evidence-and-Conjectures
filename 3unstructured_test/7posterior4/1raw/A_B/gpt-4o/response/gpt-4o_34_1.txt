Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study \( H \), we would need:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being in that field (which generally would be the proportion of graduate students in that field, but without specific data, we will assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity).
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence, which is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields. Since we don't have a complete list of fields, we won't compute this directly, but will instead compare the likelihoods.

Given the details of Adam’s personality sketch, we can estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work. Thus, we can assign a relatively high likelihood for this field.
   - \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Business Administration**: This field doesn't directly correlate with Adam’s interests in nature, animals, nor his described empathy and warm heart. Although problem-solving abilities may be relevant, it is less likely given his specific interests described.
   - \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.2 \)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity:
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \)

We'll focus on the comparative likelihoods to determine the ratio, thereby compensating for not knowing \( P(E) \):

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \]

Normalizing these:
Total = \( 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \)

Thus:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \]

Finally, the posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
