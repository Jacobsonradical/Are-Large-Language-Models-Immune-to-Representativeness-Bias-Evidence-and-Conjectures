To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" and "business administration" based on the provided personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical priors or likelihoods, we need to make reasonable qualitative assessments based on the elements of the personality sketch \( E \).

### Qualitative Assessment

#### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants**: Highly relevant.
- **Love for animals**: Directly relevant.
- **Empathy and warm heart**: Useful traits in animal care fields.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant for the scientific aspects of this field.
- **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**: Essential in this demanding field.

#### For Business Administration:
- **Love for animals**: Not particularly relevant.
- **Curiosity about nature and plants**: Not directly relevant to business.
- **Enjoyment of puzzles**: Could be relevant but not as directly.
- **Warm heart and empathy**: Useful in management but secondary.
- **High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts**: Relevant but less directly connected.

### Hypothetical Likelihood and Prior Estimations

Let's hypothesize some qualitative likelihoods and priors. These values are illustrative and not exact due to the lack of concrete quantitative data.

- **P(E | Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: High (0.9)
- **P(E | Business Administration)**: Moderate (0.4)

For priors, considering the likelihood of enrollment distribution across various fields:

- **P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: Assume moderate (0.2)
- **P(Business Administration)**: Likely higher due to general popularity (0.3)

### Computing Posterior Probabilities

- Using a common \( P(E) \) value for normalization won't affect the direct comparison as we look relative probabilities:

\[ P(H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \text{ for Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

Normalization factor \( P(E) \) is the same in both; hence we can compare directly:

\[ P(H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.18 \]
\[ P(H \text{ for Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.12 \]

Converting these into conditional probabilities given their relative weights:

- Sum of weights: \( 0.18 + 0.12 = 0.30 \)

\[ P(H \text{ for Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.30} \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(H \text{ for Business Administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.30} \approx 0.4 \]

### Final Answer

Given qualitative assumptions and Bayesian reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.4"
}
```

These values do not sum to 1 strictly due to the simplification and focus only on comparative probabilities for the presented fields.
