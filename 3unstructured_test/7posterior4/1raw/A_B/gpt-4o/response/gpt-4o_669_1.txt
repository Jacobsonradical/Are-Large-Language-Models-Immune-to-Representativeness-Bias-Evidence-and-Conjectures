To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate how the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch) influences our belief about each hypothesis \( H \) (the field of study). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \)

Let’s break this down for the fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science:

1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the evidence given the specific field of study:

    - For business administration, given the personality sketch: Adam's characteristics, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, quiet disposition, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work and dedication, do not strongly align with typical traits expected in business administration. However, his high intelligence and abstract thinking may be valuable.
    - For agricultural and veterinary science, given the personality sketch: These characteristics directly align well. Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are quite relevant.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of each field of study:
    - Without specific data, assume some reasonable prior probabilities. For simplicity, assume they are equally likely unless evidence suggests otherwise.

3. **P(E)**: The overall likelihood of Adam having such traits, regardless of his field. 

Given the asymmetry in how well Adam’s traits match each field, we will estimate a comparative likelihood, though exact values are not provided, we can infer the following proportions based on typical alignment.

Assuming:
- For business administration, prior likelihood \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science, prior likelihood \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)

Additionally:
- Likelihood of evidence given field, \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \)
- Likelihood of evidence given field, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.9 \)

Normalize over all possible fields/forms.

Thus:

1. Business Administration:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.8}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx \frac{0.72}{P(E)} \]

**Normalize using common factor**

{
  "business administration": "\(\approx 0.02 / (0.02 + 0.72) = 0.027\)",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "\(\approx 0.72 / (0.02 + 0.72) = 0.973\)"
}

Hence:

{
  "business administration": "0.027",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.973"
}
