To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), prior probabilities of each hypothesis, and the overall probability of the evidence. Bayes' rule is given as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, specific numerical values for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods aren't provided directly in the problem statement. Therefore, I will make reasonable qualitative judgments based on the personality sketch of Adam \( E \).

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles and has a high level of intelligence, especially good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Adam appreciates hard work and dedication, but there's no specific indication he is inclined towards business or administrative tasks.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature and plants aligns closely with this field.
   - His love for animals is directly relevant to veterinary science.
   - His empathy and appreciation of hard work are crucial traits for roles in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might be beneficial for scientific research in this field.

Given this qualitative analysis:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

These values are heuristic and likely subjective, based on how closely Adam's traits align with the respective fields. A more precise estimate would require specific numerical priors and likelihoods based on data.
