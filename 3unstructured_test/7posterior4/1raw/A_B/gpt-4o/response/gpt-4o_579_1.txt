To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack specific information regarding the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Instead, we will make educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge about the fields of study.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This can be estimated based on the general popularity of the fields in graduate studies.
   - Typically, business administration is a highly popular field.
   - Agricultural and veterinary science is less common but still significant.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This involves judging how strongly Adam's personality traits correlate with each field.
   - For agricultural and veterinary science:
     - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
     - Strong love for animals.
     - High empathy.
     These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

   - For business administration:
     - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are beneficial.
     - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
     However, traits such as a deep love for nature and animals are less pertinent.

### Comparative Judgments:

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can infer that the alignment is stronger with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.

### Estimative Posterior Probability:

Let's translate this qualitative analysis into probabilistic terms:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75, 
  "business administration": 0.25
}
```

This implies that Adam's traits make it more likely he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration, although the absence of exact statistical data necessitates these subjective but reasoned estimations.
