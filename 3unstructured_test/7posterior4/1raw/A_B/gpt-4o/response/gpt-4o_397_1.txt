To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more information, including the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, in the absence of explicit numerical data, I will provide a qualitative estimation based on the personality sketch of Adam and reasonable assumptions.

Given Adam's personality and interests:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - He has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He appreciates hard work and dedication.
   - These traits align well with a field focused on agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While he is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, there is no specific mention of interests typically aligned with business administration — such as an interest in finance, management, or entrepreneurship.

Based on this qualitative reasoning:

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|\text{E}) \] is likely higher than \( P(\text{Business Administration}|\text{E}) \).

Here’s the likely estimation in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are subject to change with more context or data on Adam’s likelihood of enrolling in each field (prior probabilities) and how well his personality sketch matches students typically found in each field (likelihood).
