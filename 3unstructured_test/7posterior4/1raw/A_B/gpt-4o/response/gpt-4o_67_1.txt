To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know certain prior probabilities and likelihoods. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the overall probability of the evidence under all hypotheses.

To proceed, we will make reasonable assumptions about prior probabilities and likelihoods based on general knowledge:

**Priors:**
- Prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration (\( P(\text{BA}) \)) = 0.2 (let's assume 20%)
- Prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(\text{AVS}) \)) = 0.05 (let's assume 5%)

**Likelihoods:**
- Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), the likelihood he is in business administration (\( P(E|\text{BA}) \)) might be quite low. Someone with a warm heart, strong empathy, love for animals, and deep interest in nature and plants doesn't strongly align with business administration traits. So, let's assume \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.1 \).

- Given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), the likelihood he is in agricultural and veterinary science (\( P(E|\text{AVS}) \)) is quite high because his traits fit well with this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

Since we are interested in the relative probabilities, we can ignore the exact value of \( P(E) \) because it will be the same for both hypotheses.

Now we compute the posterior probabilities:

1. **Business administration**:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{BA}) \cdot P(\text{BA})}{P(E)} \]
Substituting the assumed values:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} = \frac{0.02}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{AVS}) \cdot P(\text{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
Substituting the assumed values:
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} = \frac{0.035}{P(E)} \]

We will simplify these by considering their relative values:

To find the relative posteriors:
- Total \( P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.035 = 0.055 \)

Thus:
\[ P(\text{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.055} \approx 0.36 \]
\[ P(\text{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.055} \approx 0.64 \]

So, the final posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.36,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
