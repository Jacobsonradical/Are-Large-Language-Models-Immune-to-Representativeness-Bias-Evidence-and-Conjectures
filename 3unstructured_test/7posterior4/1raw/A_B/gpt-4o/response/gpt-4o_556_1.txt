To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given each field. In the absence of specific data for these priors and likelihoods, we'll provide informed estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

From the personality sketch \( E \), Adam has a strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles; qualities that align more with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. These personality traits suggest that Adam is less likely to be pursuing a business administration degree, which typically emphasizes skills in management, finance, marketing, and less on nature or animal-related interests.

Given these considerations, let's provide this in the requested format with reasonable estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the assumption that Adam's traits and interests are more compatible with agricultural and veterinary science. This is a rough estimation since precise priors and likelihoods are not provided.
