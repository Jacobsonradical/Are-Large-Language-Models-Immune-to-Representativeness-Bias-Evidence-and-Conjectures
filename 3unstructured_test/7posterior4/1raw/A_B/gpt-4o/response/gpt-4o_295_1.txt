To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Without specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we can make some reasonable assumptions based on typical student enrollment distributions and the given personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his strong empathy, it's reasonable to assume that the likelihood he exhibits these traits if he is in Agricultural and Veterinary Science is high, say, 0.8.
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of students in this field is moderate, say, 0.1.

2. **Business Administration:**

   - **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): While problem-solving skills and high intelligence are beneficial for Business Administration, the specific traits like love for nature, plants, and animals are less relevant. A lower likelihood, say 0.2, might be reasonable.
   - **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Assume the prior probability of students in this field is more common, say, 0.3.

For simplification, the \( P(E) \) term can be considered constant across hypotheses since it represents the overall probability of observing the personality sketch, which is the same in both cases.

Using these assumptions, we get the following:

\[
P(H_1|E) = P(\text{{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) = P(\text{{Business Administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{P(E)}
\]

To find the approximate relative values of these probabilities, we don't need to compute \( P(E) \) exactly since it will be common across all hypotheses and thus can be factored out when comparing the probabilities. Instead, we'll focus on the numerators directly:

\[
P(\text{{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08
\]
\[
P(\text{{Business Administration}}|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
\]

Thus, the values, assuming we normalize by comparison, we get:

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57, 
  "business administration": 0.43 
}
\]

To sum up:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57,
  "business administration": 0.43
}
```

These values aren't exact probabilities, but they reflect the relative likelihoods given the provided information.
