Bayes' theorem is used to find the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In its general form, Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the total probability of evidence \( E \).

Given only the personality sketch described and the fields in question, let's make educated estimates for these probabilities. For simplicity, we will assume equal priors for different fields unless the personality sketch strongly indicates otherwise. We will also assume rough likelihood estimates based on the sketch provided.

### Likelihood and Prior Assumptions

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{\text{agri}}) \): Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with attributes often found in this field. Estimated likelihood = 0.7.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{agri}}) \): Assume equal priors (0.1 for each hypothesis out of 10 plausible fields) adjusted for alignment with personality sketch = 0.15.
   - Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant, but not needed for relative comparison.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{\text{bus}}) \): Adam's attributes like empathy and intelligence can be valuable in business but are less directly aligned compared to agricultural science. Estimated likelihood = 0.2.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{bus}}) \): Assume equal priors (0.1 for each hypothesis out of 10 plausible fields) adjusted for less alignment with personality sketch = 0.05.
   - Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): Normalizing constant, but not needed for relative comparison.

### Posterior Calculation (Ignoring \( P(E) \) for Relative Comparison)
\[ P(H_{\text{agri}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) = 0.7 \times 0.15 = 0.105 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus}} | E) \propto P(E | H_{\text{bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus}}) = 0.2 \times 0.05 = 0.01 \]

To normalize, we compare their magnitudes.

### Result
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.105,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
```

These values suggest that, given the information from the personality sketch, Adam is more likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
