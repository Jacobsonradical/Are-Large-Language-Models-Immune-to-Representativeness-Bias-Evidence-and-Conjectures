To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since \( P(E) \) is common for both hypotheses, we can use the relative likelihood ratio approach to determine how much more likely one hypothesis is compared to the other given the same evidence.

Let's analyze the given fields:

### Business Administration
- **P(H business administration)**: Priors in the U.S. for graduate students could be significant due to the popularity of MBA programs.
- **P(E|H business administration)**: Given the personality traits described, Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals do not strongly align with typical business administration students. Also, high intelligence and abstract thinking may slightly align but not substantially.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **P(H agricultural and veterinary science)**: Priors in the U.S. for graduate students in this field might be smaller than in business administration.
- **P(E|H agricultural and veterinary science)**: The alignment here is strong. Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are strongly indicative of someone likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science.

Since we are comparing the relative likelihoods, we will assign approximate probabilities based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

- The probability for business administration is relatively low because the personality traits do not strongly align.
- The probability for agricultural and veterinary science is quite high due to the strong alignment with Adam's interests and traits.

These values are chosen to reflect the qualitative fit of the evidence with the hypotheses rather than precise calculations of actual probabilities.
