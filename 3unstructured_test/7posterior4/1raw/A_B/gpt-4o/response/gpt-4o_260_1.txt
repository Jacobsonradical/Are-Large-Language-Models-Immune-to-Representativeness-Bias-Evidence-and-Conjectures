To apply Bayes' rule and compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\), we need to take into account the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field of study, the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of the personality sketch given each field, and the overall probability of \(E\), \(P(E)\).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assuming \(P(E)\) is a constant normalization factor for both hypotheses, we can focus on the numerators \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) for each field. Thus, the relative probabilities can be compared without needing the exact value of \(P(E)\).

Let's assume \(P(H)\) for each field is based on a general distribution of graduate students across different fields. Typically, fields like business administration might have higher enrollment rates than more specialized fields like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without specific numbers, we'll assume them to be equal for simplicity unless otherwise specified.

Given:
- \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\)
- \(P(H_{\text{business administration}})\)

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**:
   - The personality traits in \(E\) suggest a strong inclination towards fields involving nature, animals, and perhaps solving puzzles which align more with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Business administration typically emphasizes organizational behavior, finance, and management skills, which are not directly indicated by the personality traits in \(E\).

2. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\)**:
   - Typically, fewer students might enroll in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
   - For simplicity, we could assume equal priors if no additional data is available, but realistically, let's assume:
     - \(P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.3\)
     - \(P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.7\)

3. **Posterior Probabilities**:
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** High match because of curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy.
   - **Business Administration:** Lower match because traits do not directly align with the typical requirements.

Given these high-level assumptions and qualitative likelihoods:
- \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})\) is high.
- \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})\) is lower.

### Relative Probabilities Computation:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]

Since explict likelihoods aren't given, we'll provide proportional values.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,  // Highly consistent with personality traits
  "business administration": 0.25  // Less consistent with the traits described
}
```

These values are approximate based on the traits and some assumptions on enrollment percentages. Adjustments may be needed with more specific data.
