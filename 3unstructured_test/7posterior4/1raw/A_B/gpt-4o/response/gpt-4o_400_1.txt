To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypotheses given evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence given hypotheses.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypotheses.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we'll provide estimates based on the description provided.

### Estimates for Likelihoods and Priors

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** A high likelihood because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals directly aligns with this field. Empathy and a love for animals are particularly relevant. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be quite high, say 0.9.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** The field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science is less common among graduate fields compared to business administration. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be around 0.05 (5%).
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** A lower likelihood, as the described personality traits are not as directly relevant to business administration, which typically involves leadership, management, and strategic skills. Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be low, say 0.1.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Business Administration is a common field of graduate study. Let's estimate \( P(H) \) to be around 0.1 (10%).

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \):** This normalizing constant can be tricky without detailed information. It represents the total probability of observing evidence \( E \) across all fields. Since we lack specific numbers, we'll focus on comparative values rather than exact figures.

Given our estimates, we have the following calculations (note that \( P(E) \) is shared and thus cancels out when comparing the ratios):

### Calculations
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.05 = 0.045 \]
   
2. **Business Administration:**
   \[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01 \]

We now compare the two proportions calculated above to qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities. 

### Posterior Probabilities
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.82",
  "business administration": "0.18"
}
```

These values are normalized to ensure the probabilities add up to 1 among the scenarios we consider, but as per your initial instruction, we also understand these are relative values. 

In this case, Adam's personality sketch suggests a much stronger fit to the field of agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
