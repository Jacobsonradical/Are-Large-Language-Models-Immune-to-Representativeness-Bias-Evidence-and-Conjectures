To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given each field. However, since the prior probabilities and specific likelihood values are not provided, we will make some subjective judgments based on the personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

It's reasonable to infer that these traits are highly compatible with agricultural and veterinary science and less compatible with business administration.

Using these subjective judgments, here's an estimated evaluation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values represent the relative probabilities based on the given information about Adam's personality.
