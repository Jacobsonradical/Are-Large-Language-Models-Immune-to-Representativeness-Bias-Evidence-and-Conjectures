In order to compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following equation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for simplicity:
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \)
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \)

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch being described if Adam were in business administration.
- \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \) as the likelihood of the personality sketch being described if Adam were in agricultural and veterinary science.

### Estimations:
Without specific data, we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate the likelihoods:
- Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and problem-solving, which aligns more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.
- A student with a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could arguably fit into both fields, but empathy and love for animals lean towards agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, we can qualitatively estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \) might be relatively low, say 0.1
- \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \) might be higher, say 0.7

Assuming uniform priors for simplicity (e.g., equal chance of any field being chosen before considering the personality):
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) = 0.5 \)

Calculating the normalization constant \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \times P(\text{Business Administration}) + P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \times P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.5) + (0.7 \times 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.35 = 0.4 \]

Finally, calculating the posteriors:
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \times P(\text{Business Administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.05}{0.4} = 0.125 \]
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \times P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.5}{0.4} = \frac{0.35}{0.4} = 0.875 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities would be:

{
  "business administration": "0.125",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.875"
}
