To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch being observed.

While we are not given explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we can make reasonable qualitative estimates based on our understanding of the fields and Adam's personality.

For \( P(E|H) \):
- **Business Administration:** The personality traits like curiosity about nature, enjoyment in solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are less directly associated with Business Administration but could still occur in people in this field. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) is moderate.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** The described traits are very well-aligned with this field of study. Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work are directly relevant here. Hence, \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) is high.

For \( P(H) \):
- Without specific data, we assume the prior probabilities \( P(H_{ba}) \) and \( P(H_{avs}) \) based on common enrollment statistics, which tend to be higher for Business Administration than for Agricultural and Veterinary Science in general population.

Given the qualitative nature and not having specific priors or likelihoods, we'll estimate based on reasonable assumptions:

\[ P(E) \] is a normalization factor that can be omitted here since we only care about the relative probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Here, the values are qualitative estimates simply suggesting that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
