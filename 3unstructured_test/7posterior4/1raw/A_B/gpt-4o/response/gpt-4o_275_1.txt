To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' Rule is given as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we can focus on relative comparisons between the hypotheses rather than absolute probabilities, since we do not have specific priors or likelihoods. Let's analyze the given evidence \( E \) relative to each field.

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.

### Likelihoods:

From the personality sketch \( E \):
- Strong connection to nature and plants, empathy, love for animals: These traits strongly support \( H_1 \) (agricultural and veterinary science).
- Puzzle-solving skills, high intelligence, abstract thinking: While relevant to many fields, these traits could be slightly relevant to \( H_2 \) (business administration) but more naturally align with scientific inquiry (such as \( H_1 \)).
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication: This is common across many fields and does not strongly discriminate between \( H_1 \) and \( H_2 \).

Without specific priors, let's assume uniform priors and focus on qualitative insights for likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_1) \): High because the evidence strongly aligns with interests in nature, animals, and plants.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Lower because the evidence mostly does not match the typical traits one might emphasize for business administration students.

Therefore, relative probabilities for the given evidence:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}

Note: The values above are rough qualitative estimates based on the presented personality sketch and its alignment with the fields of study.
