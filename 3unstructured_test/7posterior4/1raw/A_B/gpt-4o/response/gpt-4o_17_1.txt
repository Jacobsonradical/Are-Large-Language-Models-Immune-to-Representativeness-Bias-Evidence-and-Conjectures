To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have information about the prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field. However, since that information is not provided, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch.

### Assumptions

1. **Prior Probability P(H)**: We'll assume some common knowledge about the distribution of graduate students across different fields. A roughly equal prior probability can be given to both fields unless there are specific statistics that suggest otherwise.

2. **Likelihood P(E | H)**: This is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field. Based on the sketch, we can subjectively estimate how likely it is for someone with these traits to be in each field.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is more likely that he will be in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. 

Using Bayes' rule, the formula is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without knowing \( P(E) \), we will focus on the relative scales of \( P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Estimation:

**Field: Business Administration**

- Prior Probability \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \): Letâ€™s assume a generic prior probability of 0.5.
- Likelihood \( P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \): Given his traits, let's estimate this likelihood to be relatively low, say 0.2.

\[ P(H | E)_{\text{Business Administration}} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \]

**Field: Agricultural and Veterinary Science**

- Prior Probability \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Assume the same generic prior probability of 0.5.
- Likelihood \( P(E | \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): Given his traits, this likelihood seems higher, say 0.8.

\[ P(H | E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.4 \]

### Scaling:

We can normalize these probabilities to get a relative sense, but since there's no need for them to add up to 1, we'll provide the scaled posterior probabilities directly.

### Final Answer:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4"
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods given the personality sketch of Adam, with a significantly higher probability for him being in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.
