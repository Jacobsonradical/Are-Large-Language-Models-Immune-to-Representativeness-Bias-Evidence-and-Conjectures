To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule, which states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given the information in the personality sketch \( E \), we can make some qualitative assessments regarding the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, understanding abstract concepts) do not strongly align with typical motivations or personality traits for business administration. The probability \( P(E|H_\text{business administration}) \) might be relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, etc.) align well with motivations for studying agricultural and veterinary science. The probability \( P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is likely high.

We also need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), which would be the typical distribution of graduate students across these fields. We don't have specific data, so we'll assume that typical enrollment rates are moderate for both fields.

Finally, \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses and does not affect the relative posterior probabilities directly.

Using qualitative estimates, we can gauge relative probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_\text{business administration}) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is relatively high.

Let's present this in the required format:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Note: These values are qualitative estimates meant to highlight the relative likelihoods based on the information provided. Actual computation would require specific data on prior probabilities and exact likelihoods.
