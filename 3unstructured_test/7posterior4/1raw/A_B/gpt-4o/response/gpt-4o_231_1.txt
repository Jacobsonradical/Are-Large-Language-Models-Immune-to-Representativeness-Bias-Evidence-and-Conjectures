To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for both fields of business administration and agricultural and veterinary science using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in those fields (\( P(E|H) \)), and the prior probabilities of those fields (\( P(H) \)).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact probabilities aren't provided, we'll make reasoned estimations based on Adam's personality sketch and the nature of the fields.

**Business Administration:**
1. **Curiosity about nature/plants**: Not typically aligned with business administration.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: This skill can relate to business analytics but isn't predominant in the field.
3. **Warm heart/strong empathy**: Less directly correlating with business administration, which is often seen as more data and finance-oriented.
4. **Love for animals**: Doesn't particularly apply.
5. **High intelligence/abstract concepts**: Appreciated in business but not a specific indicator.
6. **Appreciation for hard work**: Fits but is a general trait.

So, \( P(E|H_\text{business administration}) \) is likely to be low.

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
1. **Curiosity about nature/plants**: Directly relates to this field.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles**: Useful in research and problem-solving within this field.
3. **Warm heart/strong empathy**: Fits well, often associated with a care for animals.
4. **Love for animals**: Directly relates to veterinary science.
5. **High intelligence/abstract concepts**: Important for understanding and conducting scientific research.
6. **Appreciation for hard work**: Critical in both agricultural and veterinary fields.

So, \( P(E|H_\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is likely to be high.

Since specific numerical values are indeterminate without further data, we'll provide reasoned estimations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.90
}
```
These values reflect the likelihood that Adam's personality traits align with the fields of study based on the given information.
