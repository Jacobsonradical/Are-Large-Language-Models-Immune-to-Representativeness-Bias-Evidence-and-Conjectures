To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to remember the rule itself: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) for each field, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch of Adam. Here are the qualitative assessments:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - It seems less likely given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication and hard work, which align more with science or ecology-related fields.
   - His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit, but the specifics of his interests seem less aligned with business.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field highly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication. 
   - His empathy and warm heart also suggest he would be well suited to work involving care for animals.

Given these qualitative judgments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are reflective of the inferred likelihoods from the personality sketch, but exact probabilities would rely on more precise data about the distribution of graduate students' fields of study and their personalities.
