To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need certain prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since exact empirical data is not provided for these values, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

**Assumptions**:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being enrolled in a specific field.
  - Let's assume priors are equally likely for simplicity initially but can differ in a more data-informed context.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of having the given personality sketch given enrollment in a specific field.
  - Heavily depends on the alignment between traits described in sketch and the field of study.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Prior \( P(H) \)**: We assign an arbitrary prior probability, say \( 0.1 \).
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's personality aligning well with curiosity about nature, plants, and strong empathy for animals, let's assume \( 0.8 \).

### Business Administration
**Prior \( P(H) \)**: We assign the same arbitrary prior probability, say \( 0.1 \).
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Business Administration may not align as closely with personality traits centered on nature and empathy for animals, let's assume \( 0.1 \).

### Evidence \( P(E) \)
**P(E)**: The overall probability of having the personality traits described, across all graduate students.

For simplicity, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalizing constant, but since we don't have detailed information about the complete distribution, we'll denote it in general terms.

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

While exact values of \( P(E) \) are unknown, relative probabilities can still provide valuable insights.

### Relative Posterior Probabilities:
To simplify and represent relative high-level insights, the probabilities can be compared by their numerators (since \( P(E) \) is constant across comparison):

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08
\]

\[
P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.1 = 0.01
\]

Given these values, we can say the posterior conditional probability for agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher based on the personality sketch provided. Remember these values are specific to the assumptions made.

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.01
}
\]

Note: These values are not true probabilistic measures but reflect the relative alignment between the personality traits and chosen graduate fields based on our assumptions. For a rigorous calculation, exact empirical priors, and likelihoods are necessary.
