Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow this formula:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that hypothesis \(H\) is true given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability that evidence \(E\) is observed given that hypothesis \(H\) is true.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of observing evidence \(E\).

Given the nature of Adam's personality sketch, we can infer \(P(E|H)\) qualitatively for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**
   - Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - He has a high level of empathy, making him well-suited for professions involving animals.
   - Understanding abstract concepts may help in genetics and scientific research in AVS.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**
   - The personality sketch doesn’t strongly suggest any inherent interest in business.
   - Solving puzzles might be useful in areas like strategic planning and analytics.
   - While his empathy could be an asset in roles requiring emotional intelligence, there is no strong evidence in the sketch to suggest a focus on this field.

We will now assign qualitative probabilities to each part based on the sketch:

- Assume \(P(H_{AVS})\) and \(P(H_{BA})\) both are prior probabilities for Adam enrolling in each field. Let's assume they are 0.2 and 0.2 given no other information.
- \(P(E|H_{AVS})\) is high given Adam’s interests, let's assume 0.8.
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\) is low given the lack of related traits, let's assume 0.1.
- \(P(E)\) can be considered as a normalization factor for which we are not interested in finding exact values as our comparison is directly proportional.

Putting these into Bayes' rule:

For AVS:
\[P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{ P(E|H_{AVS}) \times P(H_{AVS}) }{ P(E) }\]
\[P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16\]

For BA:
\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{ P(E|H_{BA}) \times P(H_{BA}) }{ P(E) }\]
\[P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02\]

So, relatively:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "business administration": 0.02
}
