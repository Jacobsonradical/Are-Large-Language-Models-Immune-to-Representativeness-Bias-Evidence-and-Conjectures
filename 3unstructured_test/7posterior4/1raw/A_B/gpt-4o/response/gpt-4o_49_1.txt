To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to utilize the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Breaking this down, we need to consider:
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch (this acts as a normalization constant).

The challenge is that we do not have specific numerical values, but we can make qualitative estimations based on the information provided.

### For Business Administration
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Given that Adam has a personality characterized by a genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and love for animals, it is less likely for this personality to align with the stereotypical interests of a business administration student.
- \( P(H_{business}) \): Business administration is a common field, so there would be a relatively higher prior probability, but still less aligned with his interests.

### For Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \): Adam's personality aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, as it includes a love for nature, animals, and empathy, which are common traits for someone in this field.
- \( P(H_{agriculture}) \): This might be a less common field overall, but considering Adam's traits, the prior probability would be substantial for him.

Given these qualitative estimates, let's assign some rough probabilities. Note there is no exact numerical calculation, but a reasoned estimation.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9
}

Here, 0.1 reflects a relatively low probability for business administration given Adam's interests, while 0.9 reflects a high probability for agricultural and veterinary science.
