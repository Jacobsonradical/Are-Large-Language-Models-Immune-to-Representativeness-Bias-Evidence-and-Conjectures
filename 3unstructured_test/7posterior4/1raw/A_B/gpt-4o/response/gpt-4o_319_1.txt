To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to look at the individual likelihoods and prior probabilities of the hypotheses. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this scenario:
- \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \) could be either of the hypotheses "Adam was enrolled in business administration" or "Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science."

To simplify, let's assume some general prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for a graduate student being in these fields:

- For business administration, we'll denote it as \( P(H_{BA}) \).
- For agricultural and veterinary science, we'll denote it as \( P(H_{AVS}) \).

\[ P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \] (15% of graduate students in business administration)
\[ P(H_{AVS}) = 0.05 \] (5% of graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science)

Next, we estimate \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in one of these fields:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): The personality sketch (curiosity about nature, solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals) seems less typical for a business administration student. Let's assume a very low probability: 0.01.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): The personality traits align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a higher probability: 0.50.

Finally, \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch in the general population. This is a normalization factor, but since we only compare relative values, we can ignore it for simplicity.

Now we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} \]

Ignoring the denominator (since it's common in both cases), the relative probabilities are:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto 0.01 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0015 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto 0.50 \cdot 0.05 = 0.025 \]

To get the normalized probabilities, we divide each by their sum:

\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.0015}{0.0015 + 0.025} = \frac{0.0015}{0.0265} \approx 0.0566 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.0015 + 0.025} = \frac{0.025}{0.0265} \approx 0.9434 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": 0.0566,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9434
}
