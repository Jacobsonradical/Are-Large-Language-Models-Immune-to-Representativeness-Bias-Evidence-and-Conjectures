To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):** These represent the initial probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Define Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):** These represent the probabilities of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in each field.
3. **Normalization Constant \( P(E) \):** This ensures the probabilities add up to 1 but isnâ€™t necessary for finding ratios.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, assume uniform prior probabilities for each field (i.e., before considering the personality sketch, let's assume Adam is equally likely to be enrolled in any field).

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_{agr}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{bus}) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.

Assume equal priors:
\[ P(H_{agr}) = P(H_{bus}) = 0.5 \]

**Likelihoods:**
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** (\( P(E|H_{agr}) \)): Considering his curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals.
- **Business Administration** (\( P(E|H_{bus}) \)): Considering his intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's assign reasonable likelihood values based on the personality sketch:

- \( P(E|H_{agr}) \): Higher than average since it resonates well with Adam's interests. Let's say 0.9.
- \( P(E|H_{bus}) \): Lower than for agricultural sciences but considering his traits fitting into business scenarios, let's say 0.3.

Now we can plug these into Bayes' rule (Note that the normalization constant is the same for both fields, so we can ignore it for the ratio comparison):

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{agr}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agr}) \cdot P(H_{agr}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.5 = 0.45 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) \propto P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.5 = 0.15 \]

To get back to probabilities (relative scales), although not normalized to 1:

\[ P(H_{agr}|E) = 0.45 \]
\[ P(H_{bus}|E) = 0.15 \]

So, our output in the specified format would be: 
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.45",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}
```

Note: These values are based on hypothetical prior and likelihood values. Adjustments to the assumptions would alter the results accordingly.
