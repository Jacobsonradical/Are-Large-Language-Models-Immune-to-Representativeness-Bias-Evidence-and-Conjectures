To calculate the posterior probability P(H|E), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this case, we don't have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) or the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\). Instead, we will make qualitative estimates based on the information given in the personality sketch (E) and the nature of the graduate fields in question.

Using the personality sketch of Adam and considering his interests, skills, and empathy:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and a "deep love for animals."
    - These traits are directly aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Although Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, traits that could be valuable in business administration, the rest of his personality sketch does not suggest a focus on this field.
    - There is no mention of an interest in business, management, finance, or other areas typically associated with business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, we estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

These values reflect a high likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. While business administration is not impossible, it is much less likely based on the provided personality sketch.
