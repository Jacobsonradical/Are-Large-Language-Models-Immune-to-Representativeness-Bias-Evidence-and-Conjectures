To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each given field using Bayes' rule, we need to have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods. Because such exact priors and likelihoods are not provided in the problem, I will have to make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the details from the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the breakdown needed for the computation:  

1. **P(E|H, agricultural and veterinary science)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Based on the provided characteristics like a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, this probability is likely to be high.
  
2. **P(E|H, business administration)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given Adam is in business administration. While this field can develop empathy and appreciation for dedication, overall, the fit between Adam's personality and business administration is somewhat weaker compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **P(H, agricultural and veterinary science)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This depends on the general distribution of graduate students in those fields, but let's assume for simplicity that the probability of being in any field is relatively equal unless other information is given.

4. **P(H, business administration)**: Similarly, the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.

5. **P(E)**: The evidence, which in this case is the commonality of such personality traits across all fields, for which we do not have exact information, but it's a normalizing constant.

Given these assumptions, let's denote:
- \(P(H_{AV})\) as the prior for agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(H_{BA})\) as the prior for business administration.

For simplicity, we can assume these priors are equal if no other information is given, therefore \(P(H_{AV}) \approx P(H_{BA})\).

Using this, the qualitative assumptions translate to:
- \(P(E|H_{AV})\) is high (let's say around 0.9)
- \(P(E|H_{BA})\) is lower (let's say around 0.2)

This qualitative analysis suggests:
- \(P(H_{AV}) \approx 0.5\) (for equal distribution assumption)
- \(P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.5\)
- \(P(E) \) is a normalizing factor (which we do not have to specify since we are comparing two hypotheses)

Based on qualitative reasoning and proportionate comparison:

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Comparing the relative strengths:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) \approx \frac{0.45}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx \frac{0.10}{P(E)} \]

Since we are comparing, we normalize by \(P(E)\):

Thus, if we normalize:

\[
P(H_{AV}|E) \approx 0.45
\]
\[
P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.10
\]

Formatted based on the question requirements:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

The higher perceived fit with agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's profile.
