To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we first need to understand the general setup:

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., the probability of being enrolled in a given field before considering the evidence \( E \)).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \) across all hypotheses.

Since we don't have concrete prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or exact likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)), we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch \( E \) for Adam.

### Assumptions about Likelihoods:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \)
     - Adam’s characteristics (warm heart, empathy, curiosity about nature, and love for animals) are less strongly associated with business administration.
     - Abstract thinking and problem-solving could support a business administration profile, but fewer attributes align perfectly.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)
     - Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.
     - His intelligence and appreciation for hard work are also valued traits in this field.

### Assumptions about Priors:
- Business Administration could be a more common enrollment field, with a higher prior probability.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science, while more specialized, aligns better with Adam’s personality sketch.

Now, using qualitative reasoning:

### Posterior Probabilities:
Given that the evidence \( E \) aligns much more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \gg P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \)
- Even if \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is higher, the much higher likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science would outweigh it.

  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Note: These values are illustrative based on the qualitative nature of the personality sketch. Exact numerical computation would require detailed priors and likelihoods, which are not provided here.
