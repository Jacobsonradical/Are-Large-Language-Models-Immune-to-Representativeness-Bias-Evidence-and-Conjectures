To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the given fields based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the described traits if he is in the respective field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of anyone having the traits described in \( E \).

Given we lack explicit prior probabilities for the different fields (which are typically domain-specific statistics), we can reason qualitatively based on the personality traits and the fit with each field.

### Likelihoods (Qualitative Assessment)
Based on the sketch \( E \), Adam is a person who:
- Has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, has strong empathy, and loves animals.
- Is highly intelligent and understands abstract concepts.
- Appreciates hard work and dedication.

#### Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
- Curiosity about nature and plants: high fit.
- Love for animals: very high fit.
- Dedication and hard work: necessary and appreciated in this field.

So, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}) \) could be considered high.

#### Business Administration:
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence: useful but not specific to business.
- Empathy: can be a useful trait, particularly in leadership or HR roles but not essential.
- Curiosity about nature and plants and love for animals: not particularly relevant to business administration.

So, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) could be considered lower compared to agriculture and veterinary science.

### Priors:
- Without specific prior data, we might assume a uniform prior for simplicity, but this would equally weight both fields, which might not be realistic. For this example, let's assume while agribusiness might be less common among all graduate students, its match with Adam's personality is stronger.

### Posterior Probabilities:
We assign qualitative levels since exact numbers are not calculable here. 

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}) = 0.2 \) (less common among all fields)
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \) (more common)

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}})P(H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}})P(H_{\text{business}}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.2 + 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.16 + 0.09 = 0.25 \]

Finally, applying Bayesâ€™ rule:
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture\&vet}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.25} = 0.64 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.25} = 0.36 \]

Result:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64,
  "business administration": 0.36
}
```

These values are not exact due to qualitative assumptions but reflect the higher fit of Adam's personality traits with agricultural and veterinary science.
