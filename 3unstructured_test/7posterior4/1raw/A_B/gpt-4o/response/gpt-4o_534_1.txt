To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis (the graduate field) and \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam, we use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The overall formula needs us to know or estimate the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

Since we don't have specific numerical values or data for these probabilities, we will make reasoned estimations based on the given information.

### For "business administration":
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Business administration students are generally characterized by interest in business, leadership, and management rather than a deep curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration could be assumed to be moderate to high due to the popularity of the field.

### For "agricultural and veterinary science":
- **\( P(E|H) \)**: Students in this field are likely to have a strong interest in nature and animals, aligning well with the personality sketch. Hence, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
- **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science might be lower than business administration but reasonable.

Given these qualitative assessments:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \): Low
- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}) \): Moderate to high
- \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \): High
- \( P(H_{\text{avs}}) \): Moderate

Despite the lack of exact numerical prior probabilities, we deduce that \( P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \) is higher than \( P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \), given the strong alignment in personality sketch with agricultural and veterinary science.

So, based on these estimations, we can provide qualitative values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

Note: These values represent relative likelihoods based on qualitative reasoning and not exact computations from raw data.
