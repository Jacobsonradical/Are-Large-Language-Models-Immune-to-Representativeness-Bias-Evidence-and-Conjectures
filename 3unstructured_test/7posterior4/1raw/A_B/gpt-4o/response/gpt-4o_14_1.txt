To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following components:

1. \( P(E|H) \) - The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. \( P(E) \) - The probability of the evidence across all hypotheses.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify the calculation, we'll assess the relative likelihoods qualitatively due to the lack of specific numerical data. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

We can make educated assumptions based on the personality sketch:
1. Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy suggest a stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. Adam's traits don't strongly align with business administration, which typically doesn't prioritize an interest in nature, animals, or empathy to the same degree.

### Likelihood Estimations:
- \( P(E|H_1) \): High because his traits are strongly consistent with what we might expect of someone in this field.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): Low because his traits are less consistent with typical characteristics of a business administration student.

### Prior Probabilities:
Assuming equal initial probabilities due to a lack of specific data:

\[ P(H_1) = P(H_2) \]

### Posterior Probabilities:
Since \( P(H_1) \approx P(H_2) \) and \( P(E) \) is a normalization constant for all hypotheses, the ratio of posterior probabilities depends primarily on \( P(E|H_1) \) and \( P(E|H_2) \).

Given \( P(E|H_1) \gg P(E|H_2) \), we can infer:
\[ P(H_1|E) \gg P(H_2|E) \]

Without specific figures, qualitative assessments indicate a significant difference. Assuming \( P(E|H_1) \) is much higher than \( P(E|H_2) \), let's estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,  // High likelihood due to strong alignment with personality traits
  "business administration": 0.1  // Low likelihood due to weak alignment with personality traits
}

Note: These values are educated estimates and should be validated with more specific data if available.
