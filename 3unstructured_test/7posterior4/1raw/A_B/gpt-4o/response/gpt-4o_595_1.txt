To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this specific scenario, we do not have the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, nor the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). We can only make a qualitative assessment based on the information provided about Adam's personality and interests. 

Below is a qualitative analysis to reach a conclusion:

1. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - These traits strongly align with fields involving agriculture and veterinary science, which often cater to interests in nature, plants, and animals.

2. **business administration**:
   - Business administration typically involves skills and interests in management, finance, economics, and organizational theory.
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles) are less directly related to the typical qualities associated with business administration.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide an educated guess for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are not calculated using exact statistical methods due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood probabilities. They reflect a qualitative assessment that Adam's personality traits and interests are more closely aligned with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration.
