To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch occurring.

Since exact probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Let's start with the two fields:

1. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and deep love for animals, it seems less likely he would pursue a field like business administration, which generally doesn't align closely with these interests and traits.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \): Low, say 0.1, because his personality does not strongly match this field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \): Moderate, say 0.3, given the high enrolment in business programs.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely aligns with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, making it a strong fit.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): High, say 0.9, because his personality strongly matches this field.
   - \( P(H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \): Low to moderate, say 0.2, given the specific focus of this field.

Given these estimates:
\[ P(E) \] can be considered as a constant normalizing factor and does not need to be specifically calculated to compare the relative probabilities.

### Calculation:
For **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Business Administration}} \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \]

For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E)_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}} \approx 0.9 \cdot 0.2 = 0.18 \]

Thus, the probabilities should be normalized if they are being compared directly. However, as requested, we provide the values directly:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.18
}
```

These values are rough estimates and should be interpreted as such, based on assumptions about the alignment of Adam's personality with the respective fields.
