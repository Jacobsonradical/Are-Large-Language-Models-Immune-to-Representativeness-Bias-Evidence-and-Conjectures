To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some initial probability values and our observations. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence for E.

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will make educated estimates based on the personality sketch E.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Based on the provided personality sketch, Adam's interests in nature, plants, puzzles, empathy, animals, and intelligence seem less aligned with typical characteristics of a business administration student.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) might be relatively low.
   - If we assume a low prior probability for a quiet and nature-loving person to be in Business Administration, \( P(H_{business}) \) is low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's personality sketch aligns well with this field due to his love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and intelligence.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agri-vet}) \) could be relatively high.
   - If we assume a higher prior probability for someone with Adam's characteristics to be in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \( P(H_{agri-vet}) \) is high.

We must also consider that the evidence \( P(E) \) is typically the same for all hypotheses under our comparison context.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment of the personality sketch with each field of study.
