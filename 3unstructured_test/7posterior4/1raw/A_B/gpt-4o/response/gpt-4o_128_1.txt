Bayes' rule can be used to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) given the prior probability \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Let's denote:

- \( P(H_a) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_b) \) as the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E|H_a) \) as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_b) \) as the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he was in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H_a) \) and \( P(H_b) \) and exact likelihoods \( P(E|H_a) \) and \( P(E|H_b) \), we cannot calculate exact numerical values. However, we can make an educated guess based on the likelihood of each personality sketch matching each field.

Given Adam's characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work

It is more likely that Adam's profile fits agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration.

If we assume the following (hypothetical) likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_a) \approx 0.7 \) (personality traits are a strong match for agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(E|H_b) \approx 0.2 \) (some traits might align, but overall a weaker match for business administration)

And assume equal priors \( P(H_a) = P(H_b) \) for illustration purposes:

\[ P(H_a|E) \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_b|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both, the ratio of posterior probabilities will reflect the relative likelihoods.

Thus, we might present:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these values are hypothetical and based on qualitative assessment. Accurate calculation would require specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.
