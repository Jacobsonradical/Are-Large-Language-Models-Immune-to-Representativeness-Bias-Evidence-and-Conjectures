In order to calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to account for several elements, including the prior probability of being enrolled in each field \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of displaying Adam's described characteristics given that he is in that field, and the overall probability of displaying those characteristics \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific values for these prior probabilities and likelihoods, we make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality traits and the fields in question.

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, his empathy, and high intelligence, it seems intuitive that agricultural and veterinary science would be a good fit for him. Business administration seems less likely based on this personality sketch, given that it typically requires different emphases, such as economic and managerial focus, which are not highlighted in the description.

Here, I'll assume hypothetical prior probabilities and likelihoods to provide a reasoned estimate:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - Prior probability for being in agricultural and veterinary science
   - Prior probability for being in business administration

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Likelihood of showing Adam's characteristics if he is in agricultural and veterinary science
   - Likelihood of showing Adam's characteristics if he is in business administration

Assuming the following rough estimates:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}) = 0.2 \) (assuming more students in general fields)
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood based on traits)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood based on traits)

We use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and vet}})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})}{P(E)}
\]

We normalize by assuming the total evidence \( P(E) \) is consistent:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}})
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.4) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and vet}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{0.22} \approx 0.818
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.4}{0.22} \approx 0.182
\]

The posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.818, 
  "business administration": 0.182
}
