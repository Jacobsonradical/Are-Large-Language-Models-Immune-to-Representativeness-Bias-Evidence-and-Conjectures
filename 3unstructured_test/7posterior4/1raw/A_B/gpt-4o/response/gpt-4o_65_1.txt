To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider four main components: the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), the evidence \( P(E) \), and ultimately the posterior \( P(H|E) \). While it's challenging to precisely determine the values without specific data, we can reason through the qualitative aspects of the problem to estimate relative probabilities. 

### Bayes' Rule
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here is the reasoning for each field:

1. **Business Administration**: 
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a commonly pursued graduate field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Business students typically focus on finance, marketing, and strategy, while being good with abstract concepts, puzzles, and having high intelligence can benefit, it does not directly align with the love for nature, empathy, and animals.
   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Based on the personality sketch, it seems less likely that Adam, who has a deep appreciation for nature, empathy, and animals, would pursue business. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This is a less common graduate field compared to business administration.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. High intelligence, empathy, and understanding hard work are favorable traits in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Posterior \( P(H|E) \)**: Given that Adam's interests and traits align very closely with what one might expect from someone in this field, it is highly probable.

Given these qualitative analyses, we assign the following estimated probabilities (since exact numeric data is not available, these are reasoned approximations):

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```
Note: The actual values should ideally be determined by more precise statistical methods with appropriate data. The provided values reflect the qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch.
