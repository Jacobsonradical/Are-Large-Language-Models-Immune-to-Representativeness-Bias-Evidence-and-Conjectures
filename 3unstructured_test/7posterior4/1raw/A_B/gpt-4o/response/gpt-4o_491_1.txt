To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start by recalling the rule itself:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we might estimate these probabilities for each field, though a precise answer generally requires more detailed data:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality matches E given he's in business administration.
      - Adam has a strong empathy, warm heart, and love for nature and animals, which might be less typical for business administration students.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a student being in business administration.
      - Business administration is a highly popular field.
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch E.

   Given Adam's attributes, it's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low for business administration, and \( P(H) \) is moderate to high because of the popularity of the field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): The probability that Adam's personality matches E given he's in agricultural and veterinary science.
      - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a student being in agricultural and veterinary science.
      - This field is less common compared to business administration but suits Adam's personality.
   - \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch E.

   Given Adam's traits, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high for agricultural and veterinary science, and \( P(H) \) is moderate.

Based on these insights, we can assign relative scales to the posterior probabilities, keeping in mind that precise numbers would require detailed statistical data.

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

This means that, given Adam's personality sketch, there is a relatively low probability he was enrolled in business administration and a relatively high probability he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. These values are hypothetical estimates meant to reflect the reasoning process rather than precise calculations.
