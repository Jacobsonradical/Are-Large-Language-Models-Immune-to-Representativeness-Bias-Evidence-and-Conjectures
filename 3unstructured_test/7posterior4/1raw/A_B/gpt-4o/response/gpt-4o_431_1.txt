To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the personality sketch, which is the same for all fields we consider.

Since we don't have empirical priors and exact data for these probabilities, we can only make educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided. Here are the estimates:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **business administration**, the personality traits described (curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy) seem less likely to match the stereotypical traits associated with this field. Therefore, we estimate a lower \( P(E|H_{business\ administration}) \).
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the personality traits align well (interest in nature, plants, animals). Hence, we estimate a higher \( P(E|H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Given that **agricultural and veterinary science** is a more specialized field compared to **business administration**, we might assume that more students overall are enrolled in business administration. However, since the prior isn't given, we can assume equal priors for simplicity.

Assuming priors \( P(H_{business\ administration}) = P(H_{agricultural\ and\ veterinary\ science}) \approx 0.5 \) for simplicity, the dominant factor becomes \( P(E|H) \).

Given these considerations, the posterior probabilities are qualitatively described as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
