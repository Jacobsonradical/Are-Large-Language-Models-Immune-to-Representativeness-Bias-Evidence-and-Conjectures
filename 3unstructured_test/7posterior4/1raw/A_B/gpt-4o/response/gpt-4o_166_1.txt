To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some prior probabilities for \( P(H) \) and likelihoods for \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have actual data for these values, I'll make some reasonable assumptions for illustration purposes.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) \) and \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \) represent the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in agricultural/veterinary science and business administration, respectively.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \) and \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) represent the likelihood of Adam having the described personality sketch given he is enrolled in agricultural/veterinary science and business administration, respectively.

**Assumptions:**
- Given Adam's traits such as love for nature, animals, and empathy, it seems more likely he would fit into agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.
- Let's assume the following priors and likelihoods (values chosen for illustrative purposes):

  \( P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.2 \)
  
  \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.3 \)

  Given \( E \):
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) = 0.8 \)  (Highly likely given the personality sketch)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.1 \)  (Less likely given the personality sketch)

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agriculture}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agriculture}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) \]

Substituting our values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.2) + (0.1 \cdot 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.16 + 0.03 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.19 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probabilities:

For agricultural and veterinary science (\( H_{\text{agriculture}} \)):
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.2}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture}}|E) \approx 0.842 \]

For business administration (\( H_{\text{business}} \)):
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.19} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \approx 0.158 \]

So, the final posterior probabilities in the requested format are:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.842",
  "business administration": "0.158"
}
```
