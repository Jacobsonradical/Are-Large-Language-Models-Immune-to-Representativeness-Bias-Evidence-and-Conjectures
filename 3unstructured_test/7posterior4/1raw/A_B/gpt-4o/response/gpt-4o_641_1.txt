To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field (\( P(E|H) \)). Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's characteristics—his genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, love for animals, and high intelligence—he seems to be a better fit for agricultural and veterinary science than business administration.

Let's denote:

- \( A \) as agricultural and veterinary science
- \( B \) as business administration

Personality sketch \( E \):
- Curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- Love for animals
- High intelligence
- Understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Given these traits, we can make qualitative estimates:

- \( P(E|A) \) (likelihood of personality traits \( E \) given Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science): high, around 0.9
- \( P(E|B) \) (likelihood of personality traits \( E \) given Adam is in business administration): lower, around 0.3

We need specific prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) of Adam enrolling in these fields. In the absence of specific data, we'll assume these priors are equal:

- \( P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We calculate the posterior probabilities for each field.

For agricultural and veterinary science \( (A) \):
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

For business administration \( (B) \):
\[ P(B|E) = \frac{P(E|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have \( P(E) \) (the total probability of observing \( E \)), we proceed by comparing the proportions:

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{0.45} = 1
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{0.15} = 1
\]

Normalizing these, the relative probabilities show that:

\[
P(A|E) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.5}{(0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5)}
\]
\[
P(B|E) \approx \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.5}{(0.9 \cdot 0.5 + 0.3 \cdot 0.5)}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
P(A|E) = \frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.15} = \frac{0.45}{0.60} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(B|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.45 + 0.15} = \frac{0.15}{0.60} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75",
  "business administration": "0.25"
}
