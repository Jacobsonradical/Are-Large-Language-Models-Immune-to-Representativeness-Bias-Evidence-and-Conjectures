To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) holds.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood or the probability of evidence \( E \).

Assumptions to make:
- Without specific prior probabilities, let's assume equal prior probabilities such that \( P(H_{agricultural}) = P(H_{business}) \).
- To simplify, we'll assume the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) is the same for both hypotheses.

### For agricultural and veterinary science

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \):**
   - Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his strong empathy, it is highly likely he is in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.9 \).

### For business administration

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{business}) \):**
   - While business administration could involve dedication, high intelligence, and problem-solving, it does not directly align with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - Let's assume \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \).

Given these values and assuming equal priors:
\[
P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) and \( P(H_{business}) \) are equal, and \( P(E) \) is a constant, we can just compare the likelihoods.

Final values based on likelihoods:
\[
P(H_{agricultural}|E) \approx 0.9
\]
\[
P(H_{business}|E) \approx 0.1
\]
