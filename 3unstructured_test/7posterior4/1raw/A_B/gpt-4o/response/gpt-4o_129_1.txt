To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for both fields.
2. Determine the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which indicates how likely the personality sketch E would be if Adam were enrolled in that field.
3. Apply Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Since we don't have actual prior probabilities or likelihood values, we'll assume reasonable priors and likelihoods based on the information given. Accordingly, let's make some educated guesses:

1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Since agricultural and veterinary science and business administration are just two out of many possible fields, we'll assume they have roughly equal low prior probabilities, let's say \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.05 \) and \( P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.05 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Adam's personality sketch fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science due to his interest in nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication. Let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.90 \).
   - Adam's personality sketch does not fit well with business administration, which typically values business acumen, management skills, and a different set of personality traits. Therefore, let's say \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.10 \).

3. **Posterior Calculation**:
   Bayes' rule for each hypothesis:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   However, we don't have \( P(E) \); instead, we will compare the relative probabilities, which for two hypotheses, doesn't require \( P(E) \) as a normalization factor.

Let's calculate the relative values:

- For agricultural and veterinary science:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{agricultural}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = 0.90 \times 0.05 = 0.045
  \]

- For business administration:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{business}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.10 \times 0.05 = 0.005
  \]

Combining these proportional values to form actual posterior probabilities involves normalizing, but for simplicity, we can show these relative values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.045,
  "business administration": 0.005
}

These values suggest that the probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science is substantially higher relative to business administration given his personality sketch.
