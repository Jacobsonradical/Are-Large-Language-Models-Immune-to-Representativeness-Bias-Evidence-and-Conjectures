To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) and the likelihood \(P(E|H)\). Often, we lack these precise values, but we can provide educated estimates based on the given personality sketch.

### Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values, we can compare the relative likelihoods based on the descriptive information.

#### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Let's denote:
- \(H_{\text{agv}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \(H_{\text{bus}}\) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration.

From the given personality sketch \(E\), Adam shows strong interests and skills that align with agricultural and veterinary science:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- Deep love for animals.

The likelihood \(P(E|H_{\text{agv}})\) would be quite high given this field resonates strongly with Adam's interests and characteristics.

#### 2. Business Administration
The characteristics in the sketch are less directly aligned with what we typically think of for business administration. Attributes like a strong empathy and love for animals do not strongly suggest a focus on business. Hence, it seems less likely that \(P(E|H_{\text{bus}})\) will be high.

Given that we lack precise prior probabilities \(P(H_{\text{agv}})\) and \(P(H_{\text{bus}})\), we'll make educated estimates. Typically, fields like Business Administration have more graduates than Agricultural and Veterinary Science, so we might assume \(P(H_{\text{bus}})\) is generally higher in the population. However, given the specific sketch information \(E\), the likelihood term \(P(E|H_{\text{agv}})\) will dominate for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Estimated Calculations
To make comparative estimates:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_{\text{agv}}\))**: Given the close alignment of Adam's interests, we can estimate \(P(H_{\text{agv}}|E)\) to be high.
  - Let's posit \(P(H_{\text{agv}}|E) \approx 0.80\)

- **Business Administration (\(H_{\text{bus}}\))**: Given the lesser alignment, we estimate \(P(H_{\text{bus}}|E)\) to be relatively lower.
  - Let's posit \(P(H_{\text{bus}}|E) \approx 0.05\)

Both add up to less than 1, leaving room for the probabilities of other potential fields.

### Answer
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.80,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values represent educated estimates rather than exact calculations due to the lack of precise prior probability and likelihood details.
