To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of his personality sketch given that enrollment. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the limited information, we don't have exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the likelihood of being in each program) or \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of his personality sketch given each program). However, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided and general knowledge of these fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work: High likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Given his abstract thinking and high intelligence, there might be some fit, but less likely compared to a field more aligned with his passions: Moderate likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{bus}}) \)

Without exact priors, we'll assume a generic prior distribution, and adjust it based on how closely his personality fits each field.

Here's a reasoned approximation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

### Rationale:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for animals, nature, and respect for hard work strongly align with this field, thus a high probability.
- **Business Administration**: While business administration requires intelligence and abstract thinking, which Adam possesses, it is less aligned with his love for nature and animals, giving it a moderate, but lower probability.
