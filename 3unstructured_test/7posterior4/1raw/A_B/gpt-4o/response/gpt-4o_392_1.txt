Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \), we need to estimate:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of each field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Since the actual priors and likelihood values are not provided, an exact mathematical computation cannot be performed. However, based on the personality sketch given, we can qualitatively reason out plausible likelihoods.

### Reasoning:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - **Business Administration**: Adam's traits seem less aligned with business administration, which typically involves strong interpersonal communication, leadership, and a focus on business operations rather than nature and empathy for animals. Thus, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is likely low.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and understanding of hard work make him more suited for this field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{agri&vet}) \) is likely high.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - This would typically be based on the proportion of students enrolled in each field. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume equal priors \( P(H_{business}) = P(H_{agri&vet}) = 0.5 \).

3. **Probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is difficult to estimate without more information and is often approximated or cancelled out in relative comparison.

Based on qualitative reasoning:

- Adam's personality is less likely to fit business administration.
- Adam's personality is more likely to fit agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, we assign the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are qualitative assessments and should be interpreted as reflecting a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration given his personality sketch.
