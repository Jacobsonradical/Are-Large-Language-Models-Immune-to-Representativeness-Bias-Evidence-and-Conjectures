To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following base concept:

Bayes' rule formula: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E across all fields.

Considering typical scenarios and general information, we make some reasonable assumptions:
- People interested in agricultural and veterinary science often have a strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals.
- The percentage of graduate students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science programs is relatively moderate compared to all other fields.

However, without specific numerical data for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), any exact value for \( P(H|E) \) will be subjective and estimated qualitatively rather than quantitatively.

Given Adam's characteristics—a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, empathy, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts—an estimate for the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high but not absolute.

Therefore, given the qualitative analysis, an educated estimate for \( P(H|E) \) is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}

This value suggests a strong likelihood but leaves room for other possibilities given the lack of precise quantitative data.
