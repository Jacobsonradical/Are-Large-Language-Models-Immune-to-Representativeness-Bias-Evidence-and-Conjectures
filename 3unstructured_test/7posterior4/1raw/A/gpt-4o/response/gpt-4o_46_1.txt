To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we must apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without any specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the personality sketch), \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of observing the personality traits given enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science), and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of observing such a personality sketch in the general population of graduate students), we can only provide a qualitative assessment.

Given the personality sketch provided:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits strongly align with the characteristics you might expect in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, in the absence of exact numerical data, we will qualitatively assign a high probability to Adam being enrolled in that field.

Given the qualitative assessment, I'll approximate it with a high probability value:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
