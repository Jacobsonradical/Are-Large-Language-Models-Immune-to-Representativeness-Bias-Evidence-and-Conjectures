  "agricultural and veterinary science": "To compute the exact posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, detailed prior probabilities, likelihoods, and the normalization constant would be required. However, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, there is a high posterior probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. An estimated value might be around 0.8."
