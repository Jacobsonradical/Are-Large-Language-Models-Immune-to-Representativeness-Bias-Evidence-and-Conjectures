Sure, let's use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability. However, without prior probabilities and specific likelihoods, we can only make qualitative assessments instead of computing exact numerical values. Here's an analysis based on the information given:

Bayes' rule in this context is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of having that personality sketch across all possible fields.

Based on Adam's personality traits:
1. Curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Love for animals.
3. High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
4. Empathy and appreciation for hard work.

These traits are highly consistent with someone likely to enroll in agricultural and veterinary science. People in this field often need a deep understanding of nature, animals, and commitment to hard work. Hence, P(E|H) would be relatively high.

Without exact prior probabilities (P(H)) and an overall probability of such a personality sketch (P(E)), it's challenging to provide an exact numerical posterior probability. Qualitatively, based on the match between Adam's traits and the traits desirable in the agricultural and veterinary science field, the posterior probability would be relatively high.

Given the qualitative nature, let's assign a likely high probability:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
```

This estimate is based on the strong alignment between Adam's interests and the characteristics typically important in agricultural and veterinary science.
