Unfortunately, I can't compute the exact posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) without having specific prior probabilities and likelihood information for each field. However, I can qualitatively evaluate the likelihood based on the provided personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits: genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems very plausible that he might be enrolled in a field closely related to agricultural and veterinary science. 

Hereâ€™s a hypothetical assessment based on qualitative judgment:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This value represents a high likelihood but not certainty, indicating strong alignment with his personality traits as described. For a more precise calculation, detailed statistical data on the distribution of students with these characteristics across various fields would be necessary.
