To compute the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule, we need to have information about the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field (P(H)), the likelihood of observing the evidence given each field (P(E|H)), and the overall probability of the evidence (P(E)). Unfortunately, without specific information, we cannot calculate these exact probabilities. However, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it makes sense that the field of "agricultural and veterinary science" would align well with his interests and characteristics. 

Therefore, based on the qualitative description provided, we can hypothesize a reasonably high posterior probability.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This value is heuristic and based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise numerical calculation due to the lack of specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.
