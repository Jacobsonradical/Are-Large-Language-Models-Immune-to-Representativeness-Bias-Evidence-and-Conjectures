First, let's outline the components needed for Bayes' rule:

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Given that we do not have the precise numerical values for these probabilities, I'll base the estimation on a qualitative assessment:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and high intelligence, it's very likely that someone with this personality would be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume a high likelihood, say \( 0.8 \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science as a graduate student in the U.S. can be estimated based on how common this field is among graduate students. It is a specialized but notable field. Let's assign a moderate prior probability, say \( 0.1 \).

3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch considering all fields is tricky to determine without specific data. However, since his traits could fit well in several science-related fields (e.g., biology, environmental science), it might be relatively high. Let's assume a reasonable estimate, say \( 0.15 \).

Using the assumed values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.15} = \frac{0.08}{0.15} \approx 0.533 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately \( 0.533 \).
