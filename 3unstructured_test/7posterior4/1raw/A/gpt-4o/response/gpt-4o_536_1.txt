To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Calculating \( P(H|E) \) involves several steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without considering the personality sketch \( E \). This information is typically derived from general information about the distribution of graduate students across various fields. Since we do not have specific data, we'll use a reasonable guess.

   Let's assume \( P(H) \) is reasonably high due to the nature of his characteristics fitting well with this field. So, we might take \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for dedication, this is likely high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) in the general population of graduate students. Without specific data, we assume it based on how common these traits are among all graduate students. Letâ€™s take \( P(E) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is 0.4 or 40%.

Thus, the answer is:
