Unfortunately, it isn't possible to compute exact posterior conditional probabilities without having concrete numerical values for the prior probabilities and the likelihoods. However, I can provide a qualitative assessment of how likely the hypothesis might be, given the personality sketch E.

Given Adam's interests and personality traits, we can infer some qualitative likelihoods:

- **Interest in nature, plants, and animals**: Highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary sciences.
- **Empathy and love for animals**: Very relevant, particularly for veterinary science.
- **High intelligence and appreciation for dedication**: May be relevant across many fields, but also beneficial in agricultural and veterinary sciences.

With these considerations, while we can't give an exact numerical probability, we can denote a generally high likelihood qualitatively.

So, let's represent this understanding:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "high likelihood qualitatively, estimation between 0.7 and 0.9"
}

This qualitative assessment suggests a high chance that the hypothesis H (Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) given the personality sketch E is strongly plausible.
