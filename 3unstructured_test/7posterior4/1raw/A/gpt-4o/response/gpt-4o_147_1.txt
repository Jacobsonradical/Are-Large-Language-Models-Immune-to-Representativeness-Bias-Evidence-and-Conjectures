To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given his enrollment in that field, and the overall probability of Adam having that personality sketch irrespective of his field. Without numerical values for these probabilities, I can only provide a qualitative assessment.

However, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy and love for animals, and high intelligence, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is higher relative to some other fields.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to compute.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of personality traits given enrollment in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of enrollment in the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of personality traits observed.

Given the above qualitative assessment and understanding, I'll provide a hypothetical, yet plausible probability:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

This value suggests a high but not certain probability reflecting Adamâ€™s alignment with the personality traits typical of someone who might pursue agricultural and veterinary science.
