To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch (E) given that he is in that field, and the overall probability of the personality sketch (E) across all fields. However, since we do not have concrete numerical values for these probabilities, we can only provide a qualitative or heuristic estimate.

Given the information in E:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for animals
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- High intelligence and appreciation of hard work

These characteristics are quite indicative of someone who might be involved in agricultural and veterinary science. People in this field often have a deep appreciation for nature, strong empathy for animals, and the dedication required for such a profession. Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, we can provide a subjective probability estimate.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This estimate (0.8) reflects a high degree of belief that Adam might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, even though we lack specific numerical data to give a precise Bayesian computation.
