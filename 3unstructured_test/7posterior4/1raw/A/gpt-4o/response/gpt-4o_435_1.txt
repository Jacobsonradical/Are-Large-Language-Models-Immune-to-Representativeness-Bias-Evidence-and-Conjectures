To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we need to follow the steps for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** The base probability of someone being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is \( 0.1 \) (10%) based on general academic enrollment statistics.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s strong fit with attributes like love for nature, plants, animals, and a quiet personality focused on puzzles and hard work, let's assume a relatively high probability here. Let's say \( 0.8 \) (80%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):** The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields of study. This is more challenging but can be estimated by summing the products of the likelihoods and priors for all potential fields of study. For simplicity, let’s assume \( 0.2 \) (20%).

Now, we apply Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]
