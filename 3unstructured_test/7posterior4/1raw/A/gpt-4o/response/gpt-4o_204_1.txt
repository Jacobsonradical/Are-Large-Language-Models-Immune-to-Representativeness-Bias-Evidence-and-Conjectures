To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (P(H)), as well as the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch E if H is true (P(E|H)), and the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E (P(E)).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E), we can't compute an exact value. However, we can qualitatively reason about the probability.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work

These traits align closely with characteristics likely found in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the likelihood P(E|H) should be high.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- P(H) (the prior probability of being in the agricultural and veterinary science field) is not too low, as this field suits Adam's traits.
- P(E) (the overall probability of Adam's personality traits) is shared among several fields but not overwhelmingly common in all other fields.

Using this qualitative reasoning, we can make an educated approximation. Given that Adam's traits strongly align with the field, we can infer a high posterior probability.

Thus:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \]

So, we represent this in the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
