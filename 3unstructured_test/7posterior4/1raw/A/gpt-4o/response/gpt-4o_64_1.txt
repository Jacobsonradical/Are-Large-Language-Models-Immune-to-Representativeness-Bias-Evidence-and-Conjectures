To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we'd need to have specific prior probabilities, likelihoods, and evidences. However, since we're working with a theoretical problem without these specific values, we can consider qualitative reasoning to estimate the likelihood.

Given Adam's interests and attributes:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- Love for animals.
- High intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits align quite well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, making it plausible to assume that the posterior probability P(H|E) could be relatively high. However, without exact figures, I will provide a reasonable estimate within the allowed range.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}

This value is a qualitative estimation based on the strong alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the typical interests and dedication required in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
