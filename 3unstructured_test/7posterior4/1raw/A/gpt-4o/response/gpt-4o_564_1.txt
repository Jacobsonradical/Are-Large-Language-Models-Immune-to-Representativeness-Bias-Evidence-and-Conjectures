To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have all the specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) in this scenario. We can provide only a qualitative estimate or assume some reasonable prior probabilities and conditional probabilities based on the given description.

Given the information, let's estimate the relevance to the field "agricultural and veterinary science":

- High relevance of curiosity about nature and plants.
- Strong empathy and love for animals.
- Understanding and appreciation of hard work.
- Graduate student status in 2021 (so possibly already specialized or close to it).

These points suggest that Adam's interests and traits align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the reasoning above, we can reasonably hypothesize that the probability \( P(H|E) \) is quite high. Thus, here is a subjective estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
