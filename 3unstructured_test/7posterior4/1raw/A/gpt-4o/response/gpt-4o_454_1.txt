To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability of \( H \) (the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any other information) and the likelihood of \( E \) given \( H \) (the probability that Adam's personality sketch corresponds to someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science).

Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll have to reasonably estimate them based on the provided information. Given Adam's interests and characteristics, agricultural and veterinary science seem to align well with his love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work.

Let's assign some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Assuming:
- \( P(H) \approx 0.05 \): Let's say there's a 5% chance that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \): Since Adam's personality aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science, let's estimate a 90% chance his sketch matches this field.
- \( P(E) \): Without specific cross-field data, we can assume \( P(E) \) equals the sum over all hypotheses, but here we focus on estimation and not precise cross-field summation.

For the sake of simplicity and given the qualitative nature, let's assume \( P(E) \approx 0.2 \), indicating a reasonably common likelihood of encountering such a personality sketch among various fields.

Then:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} \approx 0.225 \]

Given the qualitative assessment, our reasonable estimate for \( P(H|E) \) is:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.225 \]

Therefore, the answer is provided as follows:
