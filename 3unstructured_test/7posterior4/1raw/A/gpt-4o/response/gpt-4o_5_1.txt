To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood that any random graduate student is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we don't have the exact numerical probabilities to compute these. However, based on qualitative reasoning, we can make an educated guess. 

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He has genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.
- He has strong empathy.

These traits strongly align with someone who might be in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, while we can't provide precise quantitative probabilities without more data, we could reasonably estimate the posterior probability to be relatively high.

Assuming all necessary qualitative reasoning is satisfied and given the context of being a graduate student in 2021 in the U.S., we can propose a likelihood:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8  // High degree of certainty based on personality alignment
}
