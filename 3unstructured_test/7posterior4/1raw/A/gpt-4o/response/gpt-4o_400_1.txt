To calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without actual numerical values for these probabilities, we can't compute the exact posterior probability. I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and his strong appreciation for hard work align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Given the alignment, we might qualitatively estimate that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high. Additionally, we might estimate \( P(H) \) to be reasonable, assuming a diversity of graduate programs.

\[ P(E) \] serves as a normalizing factor across all possibilities and is usually context-dependent across fields, which requires specific data.

Given the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}
```

The value of 0.75 is chosen to reflect a high but not absolute probability, given the strong alignment of the personality sketch with the characteristics valuable in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
