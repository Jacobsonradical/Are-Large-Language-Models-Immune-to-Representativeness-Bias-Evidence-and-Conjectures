To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand the elements involved in it. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
1. \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of Adam having his personality sketch given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability, the initial probability that Adam was in agricultural and veterinary science before knowing his personality traits.
4. \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood or evidence, the total probability of the observed evidence across all possible hypotheses.

To provide an answer, we need to make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities. Since precise numerical values aren’t provided, I will make educated guesses based on context.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science in the U.S. While we don’t have exact statistics, let's assume there are diverse fields and give it a moderate size probability of about 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood Adam’s personality sketch matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science. Since Adam’s traits align well with interests typical in agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature, empathy for animals), I'll assign it a high value, say 0.7 (70%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all fields. Estimating this roughly by averaging the likelihoods of similar personality profiles in various fields. Given his specific qualities, this personality might be more common in fields related to biology, ecology, veterinary, psychology etc. We can give this a value, say, around 0.3 (30%).

Using these values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.3} \approx 0.117 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.117 or 11.7%.

So, the answer formatted correctly:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.117
