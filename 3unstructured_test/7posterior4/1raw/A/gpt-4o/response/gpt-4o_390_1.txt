To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need some quantitative data to apply to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, the prompt does not provide us with specific probabilities or a prior distribution, so we must make some reasonable assumptions based on the qualitative information.

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality traits given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the personality sketch, this seems high because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, which aligns well with this field.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assuming no specific information about the distribution of fields among graduate students, this could be considered a somewhat common but not overwhelmingly dominant field.

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality traits across all fields. This is more challenging but can be roughly estimated by considering how common these traits might be in a typical graduate student population.

Let's assume some reasonable values for these probabilities, though they are hypothetical:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (High likelihood given the match with the field)
- P(H) = 0.1 (Approximately 10% of graduate students could be in this field)
- P(E) = 0.2 (The traits described might be common among 20% of all graduate students)

Now we can estimate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

So, the posterior probability is approximately 0.4 or 40%.

Thus, the formatted answer would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4
}
``` 

Please note these values are hypothetical and the actual posterior would depend on precise data.
