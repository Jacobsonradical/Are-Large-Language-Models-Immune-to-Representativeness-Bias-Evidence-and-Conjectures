To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch (E).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits (E) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\), we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the provided sketch.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it is likely that there is a reasonably high probability that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

This value is chosen to reflect a high likelihood while acknowledging that we do not have precise data to provide an exact probability.
