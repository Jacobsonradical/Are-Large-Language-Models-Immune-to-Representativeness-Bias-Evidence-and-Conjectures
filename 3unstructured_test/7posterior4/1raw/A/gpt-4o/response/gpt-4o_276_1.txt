  "agricultural and veterinary science": "To compute the exact value of P(H|E), we would need additional specific data such as the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in different fields and the likelihood of someone with Adam's characteristics being in agricultural and veterinary science. However, based on the given personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, understanding of hard work and dedication) and aligning with the traits suitable for agricultural and veterinary science, I would estimate a value of around 0.7. This is a subjective estimation without precise numerical data."
