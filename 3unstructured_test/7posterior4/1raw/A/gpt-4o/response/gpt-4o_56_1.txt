To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): The evidence, or the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values or data to plug into this formula, we'll make reasonable qualitative assessments for the purpose of this example.

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume a prior probability that a randomly chosen graduate student might be studying agricultural and veterinary science. We’ll arbitrarily set this prior probability at 0.1 (just for conceptual purposes).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns very well with agricultural and veterinary science. We’ll estimate this likelihood as quite high, say 0.8.

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: This is a bit more complex to estimate, as it involves considering the likelihoods of E across all possible graduate fields. Given Adam’s traits, many fields could fit, but agricultural and veterinary science aligns particularly well. Let’s assume a generic likelihood for the evidence across all fields is moderate, at about 0.3.

Using these assumptions:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is approximately 0.267.

So the answer is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.267"
}
```

Note: The values for prior probability, likelihood, and evidence are arbitrary and based on qualitative estimation for this illustrative purpose. Real data and assessments might differ and yield different results.
