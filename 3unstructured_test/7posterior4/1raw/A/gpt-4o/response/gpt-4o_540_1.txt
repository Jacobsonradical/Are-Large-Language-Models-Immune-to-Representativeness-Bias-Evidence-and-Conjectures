To provide a posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more precise probabilistic information about the prior probabilities and likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in different fields given his personality traits. However, in the absence of concrete statistical data, I'll give a qualitative assessment based on the given sketch.

Bayes' Rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence of his personality.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Given that Adam has a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and a curiosity about plants and nature, it seems plausible he could be in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science.

Without exact numbers but based on the description, I would estimate the probability qualitatively as follows:
\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
\]

This estimate reflects a high but not certain probability that Adam could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his interests and personality traits.
