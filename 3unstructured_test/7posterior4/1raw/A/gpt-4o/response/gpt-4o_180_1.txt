To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would generally need the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is formally stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to the lack of specific numerical values for these probabilities, we have to rely on a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch of Adam. 

Given Adam's characteristics (interest in nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication), "agricultural and veterinary science" seems a highly plausible field for him. Thus, we can infer that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) should be relatively high, justifying a value close to 1.
