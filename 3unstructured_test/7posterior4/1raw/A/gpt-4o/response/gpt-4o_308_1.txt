To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we will use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability that someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science has Adam's personality traits.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of Adam's personality traits.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a warm heart and strong empathy.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

From this information, we can infer the following:
- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of someone in agricultural and veterinary science having these traits is quite high since these fields often require a love for nature, animals, and an appreciation for hard work. We'll assume this probability is relatively high.
- \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary sciences are reasonably common graduate fields but not the most common. We'll assume a moderate prior probability.
- \( P(E) \): Adam's personality could fit various other fields (e.g., biology, environmental science, psychology). This makes the overall probability of meeting someone with these traits medium.

Given these assumptions, while exact numerical values require specific data from educational statistics and personality trait correlations, we conceptually expect a relatively higher \( P(H|E) \) due to the alignment of Adam's traits with the agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Thus, qualitatively assuming:
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.2}{0.3} \approx 0.533 \]

Here is the answer in the required format:
