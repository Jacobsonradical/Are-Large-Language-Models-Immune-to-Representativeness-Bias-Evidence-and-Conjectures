To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to make some assumptions and use them in our calculations:

1. **P(E)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits, regardless of their field of study.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E|H)**: The probability of having Adam's personality traits if one is in agricultural and veterinary science.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the sketch, we can make these qualitative estimates:

- **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it's likely that agricultural and veterinary science students may exhibit these traits. Let's assume this value could be relatively high, say 0.7.
- **P(H)**: The proportion of graduate students studying agricultural and veterinary science might be lower compared to other fields (e.g., engineering, business, etc.). Let's assume it's around 0.05 (or 5%).
- **P(E)**: This is the overall probability of any graduate student having these personality traits. Considering how Adam's qualities are desirable but not exceedingly rare, we can assume a moderate probability, say 0.2 (or 20%).

Now we apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.035}{0.2} = 0.175 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \) is:
