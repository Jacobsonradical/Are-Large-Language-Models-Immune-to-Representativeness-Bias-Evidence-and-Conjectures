To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch E given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch E.

However, since we lack the specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

### Assumptions:
1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. We can assign a high value here, say 0.8.
  
2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This depends on general enrollment statistics. Let's assume a moderate value of 0.1, considering agricultural and veterinary science is a somewhat specific field.

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of anyone having the personality sketch E regardless of their field of study. Given the traits, it might be reasonably common for graduate students. Assume a moderate value of 0.3.

### Calculation:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Given this calculation, the posterior probability is approximately 0.267.

Here is the answer in the required format:
