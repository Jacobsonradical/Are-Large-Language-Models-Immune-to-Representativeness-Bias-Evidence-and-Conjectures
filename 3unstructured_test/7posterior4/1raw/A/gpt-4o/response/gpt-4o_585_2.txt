To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, 
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Since we do not have exact values for these probabilities, we will assume some reasonable estimations to provide an answer.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - Let's assume a reasonable estimation for \( P(H) \) given that Adam is a graduate student in the U.S. and the variety of fields available. We might assume that the prior \( P(H) \) is 1/20 (0.05) assuming there are at least 20 major fields of study.

2. **Probability of Observing E Given H \( P(E|H) \):**
   - Based on the personality sketch, characteristics like love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and curiosity about nature align well with agricultural and veterinary science. We can reasonably estimate \( P(E|H) \) around 0.9.

3. **Total Probability \( P(E) \):**
   - This is harder to estimate without more information, but assuming the relevant fields have similar traits (agricultural sciences, biology, environmental science, etc.), we may assume it to incorporate multiple fields. Let's assume \( P(E) \) is roughly the sum of probabilities \( P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \) across 5 related fields and is 0.25.

Now, we can plug these values in:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{0.25} = \frac{0.045}{0.25} = 0.18 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.18.
