To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Bayes' Rule**: Bayes' rule states that:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
   - \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

2. **Estimate Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the evidence. If we don’t have specific data, we would need to make an informed estimate or assume a uniform distribution across potential fields.

3. **Estimate Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam’s deep love for nature, animals, and high intelligence, we might estimate this to be relatively high as these traits are well-aligned with this field.
   
4. **Estimate Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all fields of study.

Without specific data, we must make some educated assumptions based on the general alignment of Adam’s traits with the field in question.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's make reasonable estimations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume there are 10 equally likely fields of study Adam could be enrolled in.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's traits fit very well with agricultural and veterinary science, so we can assign a high value, say:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is more complex to estimate without comprehensive data, but let's assume it reflects the likelihood of a graduate student having such traits, say:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.2
   \]

Using these values in Bayes' rule:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4
\]

Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.4.

So the answer is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.4"
}
