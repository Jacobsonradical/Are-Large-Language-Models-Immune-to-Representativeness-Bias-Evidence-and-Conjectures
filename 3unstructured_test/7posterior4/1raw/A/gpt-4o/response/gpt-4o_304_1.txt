To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science and \( E \) denotes the personality sketch of Adam, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make qualitative assessments based on provided information. Given Adam's traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and capability in understanding abstract concepts—the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science seems quite high, as these fields align closely with Adam's interests and characteristics.

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, because Adam's personality is well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **\( P(H) \)**: Moderate, assuming equal prior probability across various fields of study.
3. **\( P(E) \)**: Moderate, representing the general likelihood of finding someone with Adam's personality across all fields.

By combining these qualitative assessments and assuming that \( P(E) \) does not greatly vary across fields, we can say that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) will be relatively high.

Thus, the approximate value for \( P(H|E) \) is likely in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 given the strong match between Adam's personality and the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
