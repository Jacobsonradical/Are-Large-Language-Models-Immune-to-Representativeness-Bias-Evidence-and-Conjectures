Unfortunately, the detailed numerical probabilities needed to compute the exact posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule are not provided in this scenario. To compute this probability accurately, we would need:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam would be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch regardless of the field of study.

Without these specific values, it is impossible to compute an exact numerical posterior probability using Bayes' rule. However, based on the provided personality sketch, we can make a qualitative assessment. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, we can infer that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) would likely be higher due to the strong alignment between Adam's personality traits and characteristics beneficial for a student in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here's an approximate and qualitative representation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8 to 0.9"
}
```

This is a subjective estimation based on the available information but should not be taken as an exact numerical output since we do not have all necessary data for precise computation.
