To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch \( E \), we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to compute this probability, we need specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \):

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's characteristics if he were indeed studying agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is studying agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's characteristics regardless of the field.

Without specific numerical values or data, we can only provide a qualitative estimation. Given the information provided about Adam:

- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- His personality traits align well with characteristics typical of someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these qualitative considerations, it seems quite likely that Adam might be studying in this field. 

Therefore, although an exact numerical value cannot be determined from the provided data, I will provide a probabilistic estimate reflecting the strong alignment between his personality sketch and the field.

This estimate accounts for the strong match between Adam's traits and the characteristics of someone likely to be studying in agricultural and veterinary science.
