To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence. However, since the question does not provide explicit numerical values for these, we must rely on an analysis based on the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that explicit values are not provided, we will make qualitative inferences instead. Let's consider the relevant features in the personality sketch (E) that align with the field of "agricultural and veterinary science" (H):

1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
2. Warm heart and strong empathy
3. Deep love for animals
4. High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These features align strongly with the qualities typically important in "agricultural and veterinary science." Therefore, we can infer that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and prior probability \( P(H) \) might be relatively high, given the field's suitability for someone with Adam's described traits.

Based on a reasonable qualitative assessment, we might assign a high posterior probability to \( P(H|E) \).

So, my qualitative assessment for the posterior probability in the field of "agricultural and veterinary science" can be stated as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

Note: This value is an estimation based on qualitative reasoning in the absence of explicit numerical data.
