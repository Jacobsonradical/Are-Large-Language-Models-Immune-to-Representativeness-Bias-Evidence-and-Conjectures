To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following elements:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \): The likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- Evidence \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For a precise answer, we would require specific empirical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, in their absence, we can make a reasonable qualitative estimate based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general probability that a student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume it's a reasonably small value because of the competitive and niche nature of the field. For instance, let's say \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, strong empathy, and high intelligence) align very well with agricultural and veterinary science. This makes the likelihood high. Let's assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This represents the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits, considering that students with such traits might also be found in other fields. Assuming that such traits are fairly common across several related fields, let's estimate \( P(E) = 0.3 \).

Applying Bayesâ€™ rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} \approx 0.267 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.267.

Hence, the answer is:
