To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \), we would typically need additional information, such as:

- The prior probability \( P(H) \) of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- The marginal probability \( P(E) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch in general.

However, as we don't have precise numerical values for these probabilities, I can provide a reasoned estimate based on the information given:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the base rate of students enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, let's assume it's a moderate probability, reflecting that not an overwhelming majority of graduate students are in this field.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's characteristics—his love for nature, animals, and plants, along with his empathy and understanding of hard work—he fits the archetypal mold of someone in agricultural and veterinary science reasonably well. Thus, the likelihood of observing these traits in someone from this field is high.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This represents how common Adam’s personality traits are across all graduate students. Traits like curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might be somewhat rare among the general graduate population but are still within the realm of plausibility for other fields such as biological sciences or environmental studies.

Considering the above, here is a reasoned estimate:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

This estimate assumes that given Adam's personality sketch, there is a relatively high probability that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, though not with absolute certainty.
