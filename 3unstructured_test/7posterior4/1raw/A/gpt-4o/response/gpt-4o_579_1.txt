To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information about the prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, as an approximation based on the given personality sketch, we can qualitatively assess how likely it is that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his traits and interests. The high probability would be attributed to the field that matches the subject's described characteristics the best. 

Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the field of agricultural and veterinary science appears to be a good match. These traits are highly relevant to this field.

Without exact quantitative data but based on qualitative assessment, we can approximate the posterior probability to be relatively high. For illustrative purposes, let's assume a high value close to 1 without claiming absolute certainty.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This value reflects a strong likelihood that Adam could be enrolled in that field, given the match between his characteristics and the demands of the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
