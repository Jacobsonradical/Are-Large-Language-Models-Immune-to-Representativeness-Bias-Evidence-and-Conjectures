To compute the posterior probability \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

### Estimations:

1. **\( P(E \mid H) \):** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathy, the personality sketch fits well with someone enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, we can assign a high probability for this, let's estimate it at 0.8.

2. **\( P(H):** The prior probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science can be specific to the distribution of graduate students across various fields. Without exact data, we can estimate a moderate probability since this field is not the most common but not exceedingly rare, let's say 0.1.

3. **\( P(E):** The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch would be a normalization factor considering all possible fields. For simplicity, this is often a constant that can be derived from the sum of \( P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \) across all hypotheses (fields). Assuming we normalize this, it will be a factor that ensures the calculations are correct.

Using these estimates, we can calculate:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{P(E)}
\]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) normalizes this calculation to produce a result between 0 and 1.

Hence,

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.08}{P(E)}
\]

Assuming the normalization factor \( P(E) \) is such that it makes \( \frac{P(E)}{P(E)} = 1 \):

\[
P(H \mid E) \approx 0.08
\]

Given the good match between Adam's characteristics and the field, we adjust this approximately to reflect a reasonably high probability.

Final refined estimate:

\[
P(H \mid E) \approx 0.7
\]

Thus, the specific probability adjusted for clarity and realism:
