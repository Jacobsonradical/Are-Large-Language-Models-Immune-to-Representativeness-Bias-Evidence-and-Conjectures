To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Given that this information is not explicitly provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on the information we have.
 
Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given this hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have specific numeric values, we need to interpret the qualitative data.

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science needs to reflect how common this field is among graduate students.
2. \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it seems highly likely he would be in a field related to animal and plant sciences.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the evidence based on all possible fields he could be in. Given we don't have specifics for other fields, we assume this to be constant across comparisons.

Given the evidence strongly aligns with the traits and interests relevant to agricultural and veterinary science, and assuming these interests are highly correlated with such a field, we can reason that \( P(H|E) \) is quite high. 

Without specific values, it is challenging to provide an exact numerical answer but incautiously speaking:
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \]
