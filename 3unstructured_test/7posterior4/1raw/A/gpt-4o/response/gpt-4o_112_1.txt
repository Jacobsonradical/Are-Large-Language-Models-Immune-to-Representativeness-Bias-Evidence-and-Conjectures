To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that this is a hypothetical problem and specific numerical values for these probabilities are not provided, I will make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on common interpretations and characteristics.

**Assumptions:**
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science can be assumed based on the general proportion of students in this field. Let's assume \( P(H) = 0.05 \) (i.e., 5% of the students are in this field).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's personality sketch, it is reasonable to assume that he has a high likelihood of fitting into this field. Let us assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the evidence across all fields. While this is more complex to compute exactly, it can be estimated based on the average across various fields. Given the specific personality traits, let's estimate \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

Now we can compute the posterior probability.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Hence, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is 0.2 or 20%.

The final result in the required format:
