To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, given only the provided information in the sketch without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we must make a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment.

Based on the personality sketch of Adam which includes his genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, understanding of hard work and dedication, and high intelligence, it seems reasonable to assume he might be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, here's the qualitative probability estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

This estimate suggests there is a 70% chance (posterior probability) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the provided personality traits and background information. Note that this is a qualitative assessment as precise computation would require specific numerical data for priors, likelihoods, and evidence.
