Computing the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule involves several steps. Given E as the personality sketch and H as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, we apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a precise numeric answer, we'd need data on the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). In a real-world scenario, these values typically come from statistical data or expert estimations.

Given that we don't have specific data here, we will qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on the given personality sketch:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that Adam, a graduate student in the U.S., is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch E across all fields.

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and intelligence, it seems fitting for someone in agricultural and veterinary science. We assume:

- A higher likelihood for \( P(E|H) \), as his traits align closely with those typically associated with this field.
- Moderate prior probability \( P(H) \), assuming some probability based on the variety of fields graduate students might choose.

With these qualitative assessments in mind, let's assign a plausible yet conservative value within the given constraints and acknowledge that the lack of precise data limits the accuracy of our estimate.

This value indicates a high but not certain probability, reflecting the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
