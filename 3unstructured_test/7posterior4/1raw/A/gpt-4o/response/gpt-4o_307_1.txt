To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow the formula below:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (before considering the evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Let's make some reasonable assumptions and estimates:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   This is the probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. For simplicity, let's assume this might be around 2%, or 0.02 (given that this is a relatively niche field).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   This is the probability that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be as observed if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and a high level of empathy and intelligence, it is quite likely that E aligns well with H. Therefore, let's estimate this at 0.7.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \):**
   This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) across all fields of graduate study. Given the diversity in graduate student interests, let's arbitrarily set this value to be relatively less precise, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' rule, we can compute:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.02}{0.1} = \frac{0.014}{0.1} = 0.14 
\]

Thus:
