To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science \( P(H) \), the likelihood of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of observing Adam's personality \( P(E) \). 

Using Bayes' rule, we have:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Due to the lack of specific statistical data in the problem, I'll have to resort to qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it is reasonable to presume that the traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science.

Let's assume the following qualitative reasoning with assumed probabilities for illustrative purposes:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of a graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively low but not negligible, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given the match, let's assume this is high, say 0.8.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all graduate students. This may vary more but let's assume it as 0.3 for the average graduate student populace.

By plugging these values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} = \frac{0.08}{0.3} = \approx 0.267 \]

Thus, the approximate conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.267.
