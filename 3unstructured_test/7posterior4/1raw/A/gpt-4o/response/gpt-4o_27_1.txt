To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'd need specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, which are not provided in the text. However, given the personality sketch (E) of Adam and his traits, we can make a qualitative estimation.

In Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the given personality traits if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of someone having Adam's personality traits.

Based on the qualitative aspects of the sketch:
- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
- His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with this field.

Given these alignments, we can reasonably estimate a high value for \( P(H|E) \).

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This estimation is based on the qualitative match of Adamâ€™s traits with the given field; a detailed numerical computation would require specific prior and likelihood values.
