To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know several things, including the prior probability P(H), the likelihood P(E|H), and the evidence P(E). In this particular problem, we lack specific numerical data required to compute these values exactly, but we can make a qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy, the field of agricultural and veterinary science seems quite aligned with his traits. Therefore, we can qualitatively estimate that the probability is reasonably high.

Given the qualitative assessment, let's provide a reasoned estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This estimate reflects a high probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, based on the provided personality sketch. Nevertheless, without precise data, this remains a reasoned qualitative estimate rather than a calculated numerical value.
