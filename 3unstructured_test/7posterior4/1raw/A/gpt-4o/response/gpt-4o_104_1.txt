To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we require several pieces of information:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \).
3. The evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only provide a qualitative argument for the likely value, based on the given personality sketch of Adam and his field of study.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and loves plants and animals.
- He has a strong empathy and a warm heart, which aligns well with fields that involve caring for living beings.
- He has a high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which supports the ability to succeed in a graduate-level program.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication, which is crucial in any rigorous science field.

Based on these attributes, agricultural and veterinary science seems highly plausible for Adam given the description provided.

Hence, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is likely to be high, though an exact numerical probability cannot be provided without more specific data.

(Note: The value of 0.8 is an estimate based on qualitative analysis and the given personality sketch. Actual calculation requires specific prior probabilities and likelihoods.)
