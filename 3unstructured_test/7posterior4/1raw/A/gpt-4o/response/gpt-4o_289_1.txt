To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some additional statistical data or insights like the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E | H) \), but since that data is not provided, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the personality sketch.

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it seems highly likely he would be interested in a field like agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on the personality sketch and the fit with the field characteristics, an estimated posterior conditional probability might be quite high, though we cannot compute an exact number without further data.

Here's an estimation:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
