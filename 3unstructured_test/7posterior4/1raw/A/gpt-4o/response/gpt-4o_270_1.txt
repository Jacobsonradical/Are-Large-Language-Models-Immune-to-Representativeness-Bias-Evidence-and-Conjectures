To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), it's challenging to provide an exact value. Based on the given personality sketch of Adam, we can qualitatively assess the likelihood that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems a plausible match, suggesting the posterior probability would be on the higher side.

Given these qualitative assessments, I can provide an estimated value within the range of 0 to 1.

This estimate reflects a relatively high probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality sketch.
