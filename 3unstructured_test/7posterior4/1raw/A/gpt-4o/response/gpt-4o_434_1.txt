To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information, we need to make some assumptions because specific numerical values for the priors, likelihoods, and evidence are not provided.

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): Let's assume that the probability of any student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is fairly low, but not negligible. We can reasonably estimate it to be \( 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is quite consistent with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. We can assign a relatively high probability for this likelihood, say \( 0.7 \).

3. **Evidence** \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of someone having the personality sketch \( E \). Since Adamâ€™s traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, etc.) are quite specific but not extremely rare, we might estimate this to be \( 0.2 \).

Using these assumptions:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35 \]

So the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is \( 0.35 \).
