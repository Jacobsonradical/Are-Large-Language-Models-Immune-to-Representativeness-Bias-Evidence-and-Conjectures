To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to have values for or reasonable estimates of several factors, such as:

1. The prior probability \(P(H)\) — the probability that any graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any specific additional information.
2. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) — the probability of observing the given evidence (personality sketch E) if Adam were indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. The marginal likelihood \(P(E)\) — the overall probability of observing the evidence, irrespective of the hypothesis.

Given that we don't have specific data available, we'll need to make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the given personality traits and general knowledge of graduate student enrollment distributions.

Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Let's assume a prior probability for a graduate student to be in agricultural and veterinary science. Suppose it's a relatively specialized field, so let's estimate \(P(H)\) at around 0.05 (5%).

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The traits outlined in the personality sketch strongly align with characteristics you might expect in someone studying agricultural and veterinary science (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals). Therefore, we can assign a high probability here, say \(P(E|H) = 0.8\) (80%).

3. **Marginal likelihood \(P(E)\)**: This is a weighted average of the likelihoods across all possible fields. Given no specific data, we can use a base rate heuristic where we might assume that traits like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are moderately common among graduate students in various fields. So, let’s estimate \(P(E) = 0.20\) (20%).

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.20} = \frac{0.04}{0.20} = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is 0.20.
