Sure, to calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science," we need the following inputs:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science."
3. Evidence \( P(E) \) of the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we're lacking specific numerical probabilities for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). Therefore, a precise numerical posterior probability cannot be calculated without these values.

However, we can qualitatively assess the probability based on given details. Given Adam's traits:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- A quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles.
- Warm heart and strong empathy.
- Deep love for animals.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits strongly align with someone who might enroll in a field like "agricultural and veterinary science." Thus, we would infer a relatively high posterior probability for \( H \).

Given this qualitative analysis, let's express it as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

This suggests a fairly high probability, representing our belief based on the alignment between Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics of students in that field. Quantitative analysis to get a precise value would require actual probabilistic inputs.
