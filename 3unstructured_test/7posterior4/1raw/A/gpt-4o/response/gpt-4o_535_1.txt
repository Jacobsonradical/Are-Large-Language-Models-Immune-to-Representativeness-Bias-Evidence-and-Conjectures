To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To apply this formula, we need the following values:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and the field in question.

1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, the probability that these characteristics match with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science is high. We can assign this a high value, say 0.8.

2. **\( P(H) \)**: This is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data, we can assume some general probability for any given field. Let's assume it's moderately common for graduate students. We can assign this value as 0.1.

3. **\( P(E) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence regardless of the field Adam is enrolled in. Since we need to normalize this probability to all possible fields and Adam's personality might fit a range of fields, we can give it a moderate likelihood. Let's say it is 0.6.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.6} = \frac{0.08}{0.6} \approx 0.13 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.13.
