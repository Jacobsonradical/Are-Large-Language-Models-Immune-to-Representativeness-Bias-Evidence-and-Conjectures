To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) if Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits \( E \).

To provide an exact numerical answer, we'd generally need specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), which are often obtained from empirical data or expert estimates. However, in the absence of exact figures, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given.

Given the personality sketch \( E \), Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, has empathy, a deep love for animals, and a high intelligence level. These traits align well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) would be relatively high.

The prior probability \( P(H) \) depends on the distribution of graduate students across different fields. Suppose we assume a relatively average distribution without any specific biases; we can estimate \( P(H) \) reasonably.

Since the traits mentioned are reasonably common in fields related to agricultural and veterinary science but not exclusive to them, \( P(E) \) would not be extremely high nor extremely low.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we can posit that:

\[ P(H|E) \text { is relatively high.} \]

However, without exact figures, I will provide a best-guess numerical estimate within the reasonable range.

This value is an informed estimate. The actual value might differ if specific empirical data were used.
