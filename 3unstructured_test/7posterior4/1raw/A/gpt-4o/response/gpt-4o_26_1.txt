To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since specific numerical priors and likelihoods are not given, providing an exact numerical answer will involve assumptions. 

Bayes' rule can be expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence or marginal likelihood.

Given Adam's personality sketch (his interests in nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work), it is likely that there is a strong correlation between E and the hypothesis H that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Here is the hypothetical computation:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:
   In the absence of other data, assume a uniform prior distribution over possible fields of study. Let’s assume there are 10 equally probable fields of study. So, \( P(H) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Adam's characteristics fit well with agricultural and veterinary science studies. Let’s assume a high probability for this fit, say \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**:
   This is the sum of the products of priors and likelihoods over all fields of study. Since we're assuming 10 fields, this could be estimated but is somewhat complex to calculate exactly without more data. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) accounts equally for the field, so \( P(E) = 1 \).

Plugging these into Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{1} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.08 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, given his personality sketch, is approximately 0.08. However, this is a hypothetical estimation and normally, more precise information should be used.
