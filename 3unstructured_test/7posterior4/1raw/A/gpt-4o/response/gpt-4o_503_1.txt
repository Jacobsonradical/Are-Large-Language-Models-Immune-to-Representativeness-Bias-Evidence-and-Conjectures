To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To simplify this explanation, let's assume the following:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in this field.
3. \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch, which can be considered the sum of probabilities of the sketch across all possible fields.

While exact numerical values for these probabilities are typically derived from detailed data or domain expertise, we can make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Considering there are many fields of study, and without specific data, we assume a moderate prior probability. Let's tentatively assign it a value of 0.1.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given that Adam has a deep curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy, these traits strongly align with the attributes desired in agricultural and veterinary sciences. Let's assign a high likelihood value, say 0.9.
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This takes into account the probability of this personality sketch across all fields. Given that the traits described are quite specific and not universally common across all fields, letâ€™s estimate it as 0.2.

With these assumptions:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.45
\]

So, using this hypothetical, qualitative valuation and our assumptions, the posterior conditional probability would be:

\[
\boxed{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.45"
}
\]
