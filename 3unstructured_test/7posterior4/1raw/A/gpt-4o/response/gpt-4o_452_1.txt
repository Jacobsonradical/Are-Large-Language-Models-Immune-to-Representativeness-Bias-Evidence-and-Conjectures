To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following information:
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\): The probability of the evidence \(E\).

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The exact values for these probabilities can be hard to quantify without specific data points, but we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate.

1. **\(P(E|H)\)**:  
   Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and high intelligence. This suggests a relatively high value, perhaps around 0.8.

2. **\(P(H)\)**:  
   As a graduate student in the U.S., the prior probability \(P(H)\) would be influenced by how many students are enrolled in fields related to agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume this is relatively specialized; thus, \(P(H)\) might be around 0.05.

3. **\(P(E)\)**:  
   The probability of the evidence \(E\) under all possible hypotheses \(H\), is harder to determine, but for simplicity, let's approximate it assuming students have diverse interests and fields. We will assume \(P(E)\) as 0.2, recognizing that his features align significantly with few fields.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the evidence \(E\) is:
