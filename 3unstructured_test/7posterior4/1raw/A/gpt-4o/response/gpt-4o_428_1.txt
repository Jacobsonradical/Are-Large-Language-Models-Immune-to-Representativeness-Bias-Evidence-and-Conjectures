Utilizing Bayes' theorem involves calculating the posterior probability, \( P(H|E) \), which states the probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \). However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods (which require detailed numerical data about the fields and the general population of graduate students in those fields), it's not possible to compute an exact numerical probability.

That said, we can reasonably argue that given Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work, the field of agricultural and veterinary science aligns quite well with his personality traits as described. Thus, the posterior probability should be relatively high compared to other fields.

While acknowledging that we are making an informed estimate rather than a calculated probability, we can nonetheless express a high confidence level:
