To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods of observing the evidence under each hypothesis. However, since we don't have explicit numerical values for prior probabilities or likelihood ratios, we can provide a qualitative assessment instead.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information we have:
- \(E\): Adam's personality sketch
- \(H\): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science

We know that Adam has a curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and strong empathy. These traits are highly aligned with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E | H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

Given this qualitative analysis, we can infer that the probability \( P(H | E) \) should be significantly higher than random chance. While we cannot compute an exact value without more data, we can provide a confident estimate.

This estimate suggests a strong likelihood that Adam, with his given personality traits, could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, though it is not an absolute certainty.
