To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \), which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before taking into account his personality traits.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. The evidence \( P(E) \), which is the overall probability of Adam's personality traits across all possible fields he might be enrolled in.

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical data for these probabilities, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided. 

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Assuming no specific prior information about the likelihood of Adam choosing any field, we could consider a uniform prior. Letâ€™s assign an arbitrary value, e.g., 0.1 (assuming 10 different fields he could possibly be enrolled in).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   The likelihood that someone with Adam's characteristics would be in agricultural and veterinary science might be considered high, given his love for animals, nature, and strong empathy. Let's assume a high probability, say 0.8.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: 
   The evidence would account for how common these personality traits are across all possible fields. If we assume these traits are relatively common and valuable in various fields (e.g., biology, psychology), let's consider a moderate value such as 0.2.

Applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.4 \]

Considering our assumptions and the limitations of not having concrete data, the posterior probability can be reasonably estimated as 0.4.
