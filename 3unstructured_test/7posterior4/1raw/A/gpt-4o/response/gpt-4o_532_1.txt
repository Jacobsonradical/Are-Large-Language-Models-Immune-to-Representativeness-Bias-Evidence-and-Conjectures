To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to consider and specify several components:

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) given the evidence (personality sketch).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Without specific probabilities for each of these components, one common approach is to consider qualitative probabilistic reasoning.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He has strong empathy.

These characteristics align well with someone who might be studying agricultural and veterinary science, which would generally require a strong interest in plants, animals, and an empathetic approach to the well-being of living organisms.

For simplicity, we'll assume some rough approximations:
- \( P(E | H) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood that the personality traits match someone in this field).
- \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (given the multitude of fields one could be enrolled in, assuming a small but reasonable prior for being in this specific field).
- \( P(E) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming a moderate likelihood the traits described apply broadly).

Using these values:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.09}{0.2} = 0.45 \]

So the posterior conditional probability \( P(H | E) \) is:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45
}

This value is an estimation and should be adjusted with exact probabilities if available.
