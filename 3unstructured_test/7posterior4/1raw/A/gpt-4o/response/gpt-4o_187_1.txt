To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have access to a few key probabilities:

1. \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidences in the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): Prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) which, in this case, is the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): Overall probability of observing the evidences in the personality sketch \( E \), regardless of the hypothesis.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, without specific data on these probabilities, I cannot provide an exact numerical value. I can offer a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits are highly consistent with those of someone likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given this qualitative analysis and assuming \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science) has a reasonable non-trivial value, we might infer that \( P(E|H) \) is also high, given the personality traits provided.

Let's denote \( P(E|H) \) as high, \( P(H) \) as non-trivial, and assume a general prior:

\[
P(H|E) \text{ for agricultural and veterinary science would be relatively high} 
\]

Therefore, providing a qualitative estimate for the sake of the format requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

This number represents a high but not certain probability based on the qualitative match of Adamâ€™s personality traits with the typical traits of someone in agricultural and veterinary science fields. Please remember this is an estimated value rather than one calculated from exact numeric probabilities.
