To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) which is the probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the personality sketch. 
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) which is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) which is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the provided information. Generally, we consider how well the personality traits align with the field in question.

Given Adam's attributes such as a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "strong empathy," "deep love for animals," etc., he seems to have characteristics that align well with a field involving nature, animals, and potentially veterinarian-related tasks.

Considering these qualitative assessments, let us assume:

- \( P(H) \) is moderately high because among all possible fields, agricultural and veterinary sciences would be one of the more likely choices for someone with Adam's personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is very high because a student in agricultural and veterinary science is highly likely to have Adam's personality traits.
- \( P(E) \) is a bit lower because many fields could fit some part of Adam's personality, but agricultural and veterinary science fits quite well.

Given these qualitative assessments, we hypothesize \( P(H|E) \) to be relatively high. For the sake of this exercise, let's approximate it as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"
}
```

This approximation reflects a high likelihood, but not with absolute certainty, given the overlap of personality traits with other fields possible.
