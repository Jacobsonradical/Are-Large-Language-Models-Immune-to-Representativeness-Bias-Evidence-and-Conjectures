To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on the provided personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the personality sketch.

However, without concrete data on the prior probabilities and specific likelihoods, we'll need to use reasonable subjective estimates based on the information provided:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: We assume a moderate base rate, say 0.05 (indicative, since it varies by university and disciplines available).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits (love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, intelligence, and understanding of hard work), it's quite compatible with interests in agricultural and veterinary science. Maybe around 0.85.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: Needed to normalize, but since we don't have exact data for this purpose and for simplicity, we assume this is balanced across different fields. Let's assume this as a rough estimate, say 0.10.

Applying Bayes' Rule with these assumptions:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.05}{0.10} = 0.425 \]

Thus, in the required format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.425"
