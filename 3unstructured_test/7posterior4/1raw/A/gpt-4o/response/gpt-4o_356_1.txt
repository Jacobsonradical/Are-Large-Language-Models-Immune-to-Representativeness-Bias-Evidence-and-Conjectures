To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Let's break down what we have:
1. **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing the personality traits and behavior of Adam (\( E \)) if he were enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science (\( H \)).

Given Adam's love for nature, plants, animals, and his high intelligence along with empathy and understanding, it seems quite likely that he would fit well in this field. So, \( P(E|H) \) could be considered high.

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Without specific data on how many students are enrolled in each field, we will assume it to be a general likelihood amongst various fields. Let's assume moderate prior probability.

3. **P(E)**: This is the marginal probability of observing the evidence \( E \) over all possible hypotheses. This can be complex to calculate but conceptually, it’s the sum over all such probabilities for different fields Adam might be in.

Given the assumptions required, let's provide a reasonable estimation, keeping it simple with conditional probabilities being considered quite high for this combination.

Here’s a plausible value strictly based on the information and interpretations we have:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}

This assigns a high posterior probability that Adam's personality traits and interests align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
