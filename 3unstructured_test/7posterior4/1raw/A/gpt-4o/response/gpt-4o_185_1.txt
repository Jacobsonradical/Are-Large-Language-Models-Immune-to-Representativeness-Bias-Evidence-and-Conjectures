To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to break this down into the following components:
1. \( P(E|H) \) - the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \) - the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Given the lack of numerical data, we have to make reasonable subjective assessments based on the provided information and common knowledge about the field. 

- \( P(E|H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science is a field that aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, and empathy. Therefore, we will assign a high likelihood to \( P(E|H) \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is in agricultural and veterinary science is relatively low compared to more common fields such as engineering, business, or social sciences.
- \( P(E) \): The overall likelihood of Adam's personality sketch across all fields including common ones.

Let's assign rough subjective values to these probabilities:
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) - Strong alignment with his personality traits.
- \( P(H) = 0.05 \) - Assuming a small fraction of graduate students are in this field.
- \( P(E) \) - This would be a weighted sum of the likelihoods of the sketch across all fields but to simplify let's normalize it.

Since \( P(E) \) is the denominator and considering we already normalized \( P(H) \), let's approximate it also to cover non-specific fields likelihood:

\[ P(E) \approx 0.2 \] - Weighted average considering common fields.

Applying Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch is approximately:
