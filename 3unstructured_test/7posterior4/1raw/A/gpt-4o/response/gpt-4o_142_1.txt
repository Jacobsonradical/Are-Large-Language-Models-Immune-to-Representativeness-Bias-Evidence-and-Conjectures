To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would generally need specific values for:

- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is formally given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make an informed estimate based on the given personality sketch and the nature of the field.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it is likely these characteristics are well-aligned with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, we can qualitatively infer that the probability is reasonably high.

However, without exact numerical data, we must provide a subjective estimate based on the alignment of the sketch with the field.
