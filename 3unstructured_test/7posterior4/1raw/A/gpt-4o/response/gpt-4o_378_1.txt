To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). The Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this scenario, we do not have specific values for these probabilities. However, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch E of Adam and the likelihood H that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the details in the sketch:
1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and plants** aligns well with agricultural sciences.
2. **Love for animals** aligns with veterinary science.
3. **High intelligence and abstract thinking** could be beneficial in various scientific fields.

Without exact numerical values, we will make an educated guess based on the qualitative compatibility between Adam's personality and the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75"

This is a subjective assessment, indicating a relatively high but not certain probability, based on the congruence between the personality sketch and the field in question. For a precise calculation, exact prior, likelihood, and evidence values would be necessary.
