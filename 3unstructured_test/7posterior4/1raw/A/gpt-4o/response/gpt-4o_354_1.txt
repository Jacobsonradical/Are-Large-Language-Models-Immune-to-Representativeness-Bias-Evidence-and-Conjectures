Sure, to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we will need the following elements:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' Rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll provide a qualitative assessment instead.

- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: We don't have specific data, but let's assume a moderate likelihood since agricultural and veterinary science is a relatively common field related to Adam's interests in nature and animals.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given his personality sketch (interest in nature, love for animals, understanding hard work, and intelligence), it is highly likely that this profile matches someone in agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The sketch might generally fit other fields too, but it strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these considerations, while we can't provide a precise number without more information, we can infer a reasonably high posterior probability due to the strong match between the personality sketch and the typical profile of someone in agricultural and veterinary science.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.75 to 0.9"
}
```

This range reflects a higher likelihood given the qualitative match while acknowledging that without exact priors it's not possible to give a precise number.
