  "agricultural and veterinary science": "The exact numerical posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for agricultural and veterinary science cannot be calculated with the given information. Generally, P(H|E) depends on specific prior probabilities and likelihoods which are not provided here. However, given Adam's personality sketch including genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, we can infer qualitatively that \( P(H|E) \) is relatively high, although a precise value cannot be determined."
