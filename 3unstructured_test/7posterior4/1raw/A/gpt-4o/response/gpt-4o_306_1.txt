To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) (the likelihood that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch E), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to give an exact numerical value, we need to know three things:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): The marginal probability of observing the personality sketch E.

Given that we don't have specific prior probabilities or exact likelihood functions, providing an exact numerical value is difficult. However, we can infer qualitative reasoning based on the traits described in E which closely align with agricultural and veterinary science.

Given the context:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits are very compatible with someone who might be studying agricultural and veterinary science.

Thus, based on qualitative reasoning, we might infer a high posterior probability. If we were to assign a subjective value for illustrative purposes, assuming other fields are equally probable a priori, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) might be estimated as high.

Here is the answer as requested:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}

Note: Keep in mind, this is a subjective estimate derived from qualitative analysis. For precise computation, empirical data and priors would be necessary.
