To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch \( E \), we would typically use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \)
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \)

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, it's challenging to provide an exact mathematical value. Instead, let's qualitatively assess the evidence based on the characteristics provided.

Given the personality sketch:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- A deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts
  
These traits are highly consistent with someone who might choose a career in agricultural and veterinary science. Given this qualitative assessment, one could reasonably assume that the probability \( P(H|E) \) is relatively high. 

For the sake of providing a numerical value within the required range, let's estimate:

\{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
\}

This value, \( 0.8 \), reflects a strong likelihood that given his interests and personality, Adam might be enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
