To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more specific information, such as prior probabilities for each field and the likelihood of having the given personality sketch within each field. Since this information is not provided, the question cannot be accurately answered with a specific numerical value. However, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, he seems like a good fit for the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, while a specific numerical probability cannot be calculated without additional data, qualitatively, the probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch seems reasonably high.

Based on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This value is a subjective and hypothetical assessment based on the given information. For a precise calculation, additional data on prior probabilities and likelihoods would be necessary.
