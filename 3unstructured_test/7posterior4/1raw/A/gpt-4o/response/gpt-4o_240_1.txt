To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, in this context, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities. 

Here is the Bayes' rule formula for reference:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information in the personality sketch of Adam, we can make some qualitative assessments. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and strong empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science. These fields require a passion for nature, plants, animals, and empathy, alongside the intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts that Adam possesses.

Therefore, on a qualitative basis, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science seems reasonably high.

Without specific numerical data, the best we can do is estimate. Given his strong alignment with the characteristics needed in agricultural and veterinary science, we may assign a high probability such as 0.7 or 0.8. For clarity, let's assign a probability of 0.75.
