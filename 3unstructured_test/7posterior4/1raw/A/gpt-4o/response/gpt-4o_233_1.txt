To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the provided personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the personality sketch E across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we must make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Love for animals.
- Strong empathy.
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation and understanding of hard work and dedication.

These traits align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

Let’s assume:
- \( P(H) \): Since he is a graduate student in the U.S., and considering the commonality of various graduate fields, let's assume a conservative prior probability for agricultural and veterinary science, say 0.1.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given that Adam's personality sketch strongly fits someone in agricultural and veterinary science, let’s assume a high likelihood, say 0.8.
- \( P(E) \): This is the normalization factor, and for simplicity, we can assume it is an aggregate of all likelihoods across all hypotheses, which we can assume to be 1 for normalization.

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{1} = 0.08 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

Note: These values are dependent on assumed probabilities. In an actual scenario, more precise data and domain-specific knowledge would be necessary for an accurate calculation.
