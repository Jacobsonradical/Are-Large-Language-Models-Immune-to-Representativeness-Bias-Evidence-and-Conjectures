To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   This is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science without any specific information about Adam. This value is generally based on statistical data about the distribution of students across various fields. Let's denote this as \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \).

2. **Identify the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. This would involve estimating how likely it is for a student in this field to have the characteristics described in \( E \). 

3. **Identify the Evidence \( P(E) \):**
   This is the probability of the personality sketch \( E \) occurring across all fields of study. 

4. **Compute the Posterior Probability \( P(H|E) \):**
   Using Bayes' rule, \( P(H|E) \) is given by:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Given the subjective nature of some of the probabilities required and hypothetical values, I will make some educated assumptions to provide an answer.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   Let's assume, based on statistical data, that 5% of graduate students are enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science:
   \[
   P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):**
   The characteristics described seem to align well with someone in agricultural and veterinary science (e.g., love for animals, interest in nature and plants, empathy, understanding of hard work). Suppose we estimate this likelihood to be quite high, around 0.8:
   \[
   P(E | H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):**
   This is more challenging to estimate directly; it involves the overall probability of a graduate student having the described personality traits. Let's assume that 20% of graduate students across all fields exhibit similar personality traits:
   \[
   P(E) = 0.2
   \]

Using Bayes' rule, we compute:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.2} = \frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2
\]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability is:
