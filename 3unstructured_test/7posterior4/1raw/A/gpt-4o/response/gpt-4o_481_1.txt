To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). The formula for Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without knowing the precise values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make some informed estimates based on the given data. 

For the field of agricultural and veterinary science:

1. Prior Probability \( P(H) \): This is the probability that a randomly chosen graduate student is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. This can be quite low, given the specificity of the field.

2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): This is the probability of Adam having the personality traits \( E \) if he is indeed enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his interest in nature and love for animals, this could be quite high.

3. Evidence \( P(E) \): This is the overall probability of a graduate student having traits \( E \). We don't have this value, but we know that this encompasses students from all fields.

Given Adam's strong affinity for nature, love for animals, and dedication, these traits align well with those required in agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, without precise numerical data, we can make a qualitative assessment that \( P(H|E) \) is relatively higher than other fields Adam could potentially be enrolled in.

Taking this qualitative assessment into account, while still maintaining the need for objectiveness but reflecting a more informed estimate, we can postulate:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \]

Therefore,
