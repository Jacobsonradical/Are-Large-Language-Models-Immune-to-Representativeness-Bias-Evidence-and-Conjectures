To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically require specific data on the probability of each hypothesis (field of study) given the evidence (personality sketch) as well as base rates of those fields among graduate students. However, since this specific data is not provided, I will make an educated estimate based on the provided characteristics and their alignment with the field in question.

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, it seems plausible that he could be well-suited for a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

Here's my estimated probability:
