To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide a value, we need specific probabilities:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing E given H (the personality traits given Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing E in general.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make a qualitative assessment. 

- A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a high appreciation for hard work are pertinent traits for someone likely in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- Solving puzzles and high intelligence could relate to various fields but can still align with agricultural studies due to research and problem-solving aspects in these fields.

Given these observations, we can reasonably infer that the posterior probability should be moderate to high. However, without specific prior and likelihood probabilities, we can provide a plausible estimate based on the qualitative match of the profile E with the field of H.

This value is an educated estimate given the available qualitative traits and their alignment with the typical characteristics one might expect in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Adjustments would be necessary with more specific data.
