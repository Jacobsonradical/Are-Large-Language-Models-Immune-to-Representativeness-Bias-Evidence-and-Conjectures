To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to calculate this, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods which are typically obtained from empirical data. Since we don't have those exact values, we'll use qualitative reasoning to assign plausible values based on Adam's described traits and how they align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability that a random graduate student is in the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Let's assume graduate fields are fairly diversified but the exact distribution isn't provided here. We'll consider \( P(H) \) to be moderate, around 0.1 (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is in the agricultural and veterinary science field. Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, his field fits well with his traits. We might assign \( P(E|H) \) a high value, say 0.7 (70%).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields. Since his traits are quite specific but not extremely rare, we'll assign this a reasonable value, say 0.3 (30%).

Using these values, we can apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{0.3} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.3} \]

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.233 \]

So, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is approximately 0.233 (23.3%).

Here's the answer in the requested format:
