To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood that the personality sketch E would be observed given that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch E regardless of the field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific data to inform these probabilities, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the context and the provided information.

Assumptions:
1. Given Adam's deep love for animals, nature, and plants, combined with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it's reasonable to assume \( P(E|H) \) is fairly high for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. The prior probability \( P(H) \) could be estimated based on the distribution of graduate students across various fields, but we'll assume a low to moderate prior because not all students are in that field.
3. \( P(E) \) would be normalizing over all possible fields, making it moderate as well.

Based on these assumptions, let's assign some notional probabilities for illustration:

1. Let \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \): It's quite likely that Adam's profile fits students in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. Let \( P(H) = 0.1 \): A small but significant portion of graduate students might be in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. Let \( P(E) = 0.2 \): A composite probability reflecting all possible fields given the personality sketch.

Now using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

So the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E is:
