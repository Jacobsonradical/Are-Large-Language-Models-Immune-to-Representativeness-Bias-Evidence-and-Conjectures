To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would normally need the following pieces of information:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The probability that a typical graduate student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, irrespective of any additional information.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability that we would observe the personality sketch E given that the student is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the personality sketch E across all possible fields that Adam could be enrolled in.

However, since specific data on these probabilities is not provided, a precise numerical value can't be accurately computed. Nonetheless, based on the provided personality sketch, we can qualitatively estimate the probability, as his interests and personality traits strongly align with a field related to nature, plants, and animals.

Considering these qualitative factors:

1. His genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. His love for animals.
3. His empathy and warm heart, which are valuable traits in veterinary science.
4. His intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which are beneficial in any scientific field.

All these factors increase the likelihood that Adam might be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, qualitatively, the posterior conditional probability should be high. 

Given this reasoning, we can suggest a high probability value, though not exact, without the specific data. 

Here's the answer in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
```

This representation reflects a high but not absolute certainty that Adam is studying in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
