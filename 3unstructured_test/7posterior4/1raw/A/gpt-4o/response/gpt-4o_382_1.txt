To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know more detailed information, such as the prior probabilities of Adam being in each field and the likelihood of his personality traits given his enrollment in those fields. However, since this information is not provided in the question, any computed value would be speculative.

Given the personality sketch provided, which highlights Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his warm, empathetic nature, we can use a qualitative assessment to estimate the posterior conditional probability for the field of "agricultural and veterinary science."

To structure the response according to your specified format and ensure it falls within the range of 0 to 1, I'll give an estimated probability based on the available information:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This value is chosen qualitatively based on the alignment between the field of agricultural and veterinary science and Adam's described interests and traits. However, please note that this is not a rigorous quantitative answer due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood data.
