To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need prior probabilities, the likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis, and the total probability of evidence.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), the exact computation cannot be performed. Given the qualitative nature of Adam's personality sketch and his alignment with characteristics that are generally strong indicators for a field related to agricultural and veterinary science, we can still make an educated guess based on the provided information.

Since Adam has a strong empathy, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication which align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, one could reasonably hypothesize that:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \]

This estimate assumes that Adam's profile strongly matches the qualities commonly associated with students in this field, but without exact prior knowledge, specific probabilities should be considered approximations.

So the answer in the required format is:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
