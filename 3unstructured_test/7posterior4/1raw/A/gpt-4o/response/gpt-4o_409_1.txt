To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would need information such as:

1. **\( P(E|H) \)** - The likelihood: the probability of obtaining the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
2. **\( P(H) \)** - The prior: the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
3. **\( P(E) \)** - The evidence: the total probability of the personality sketch \( E \) irrespective of the field.

Without specific data for the exact values, I'll provide an educated guess based on the information we have. Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, animals, and a deep understanding of hard work, agricultural and veterinary science seems like a highly plausible field. Here, we'll make some assumptions to give an estimated probability.

Assumptions:
1. **\( P(E|H) \)**: High, because Adam's traits (interest in plants and animals, empathy, intelligence) align well with typical characteristics of students in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
2. **\( P(H) \)**: Based on the popularity among graduates: Assume we have a general baseline probability for selecting this major. Letâ€™s assume moderate popularity.
3. **\( P(E) \)**: Average for graduate students.

Under these assumptions, \( P(H|E) \) might be considerably high because the personality traits match well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.

Putting into format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

This 0.8 value is a plausible posterior probability given the personality traits align well with the characteristics beneficial in agricultural and veterinary science.
