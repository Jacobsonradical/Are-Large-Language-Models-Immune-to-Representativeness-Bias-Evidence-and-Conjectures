To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). However, without specific numerical data for these probabilities, we cannot calculate an exact value. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Love for animals
- Strong empathy and warm heart
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits heavily align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, as it involves a deep understanding of nature, plants, animals, and the hard work associated with these areas.

So, a qualitative estimate would be relatively high, though we can't compute an exact value. As a rough qualitative guess, it could be around 0.8 to 0.9. 

Thus, the answer can be framed as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
