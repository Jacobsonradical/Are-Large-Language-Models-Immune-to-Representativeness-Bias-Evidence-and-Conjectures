Unfortunately, I cannot compute an exact numerical value for the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, I can provide a qualitative assessment:

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, as well as his high intelligence and appreciation for dedication, it is reasonable to believe that the hypothesis \( H \) (that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science) has a high posterior probability given the evidence \( E \).

Therefore, a qualitative estimate would suggest a high value between 0 and 1.
