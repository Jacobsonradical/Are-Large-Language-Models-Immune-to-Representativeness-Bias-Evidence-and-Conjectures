To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, considerable information is needed, such as the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Since these values are not specified in the prompt, an exact computation is not possible. However, a qualitative analysis can provide an insightful estimate.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):** This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science before considering the personality sketch.
   - Let’s assume it is a moderate probability because there is no specific information that indicates how many students choose this field.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** This is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field, suggesting a high likelihood.

3. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E)):** This is what we aim to estimate after considering the personality sketch E.

Using qualitative reasoning based on the alignment of Adam’s interests and empathy with agricultural and veterinary science, we can reasonably infer a high posterior probability.

Hence, the estimated posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is given below:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85"
}
```

This estimate reflects a high probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science based on his personality traits.
