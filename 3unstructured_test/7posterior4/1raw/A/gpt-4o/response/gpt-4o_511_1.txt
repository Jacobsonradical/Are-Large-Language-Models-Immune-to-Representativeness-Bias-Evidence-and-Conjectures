Given the lack of specific numerical data, I can't compute an exact value for the posterior probability. However, I can give a qualitative assessment based on the information provided.

Here is the qualitative assessment:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "It is likely that Adam could be enrolled in this field given his genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Thus, the probability would be reasonably high, let's say around 0.7 to reflect this moderate to strong likelihood."
