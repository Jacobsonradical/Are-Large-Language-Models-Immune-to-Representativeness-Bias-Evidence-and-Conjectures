To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's an outline of the terms:
- \( P(H|E) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of someone having the personality sketch \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors and the likelihoods, we can rely on qualitative analysis to provide a reasonable estimate. Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and intelligence, seem consistent with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. However, without concrete base rate data, we'll make an informed qualitative guess.

Given the information and assuming some logical estimates for the distribution of graduate students across fields, I'll provide an educated estimate.

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"

This value suggests that there is a fairly high probability that Adam could be studying in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch.
