To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the components of Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence E.

For this sketch, we can assume certain probabilities based on the provided information. However, without specific data, we'll have to make educated guesses based on reasonable assumptions about Adam's personality and interests.

### Assumptions:

1. **P(E|H)**: Adam’s personality seems well-suited for agricultural and veterinary science (empathy, love for nature and animals, appreciation for hard work). We'll assume a high probability, say 0.7 (70%).

2. **P(H)**: This is trickier without knowing the base rate of enrollment in agricultural and veterinary science among graduate students. Let's assume that this field is chosen by about 5% of graduate students, hence P(H) = 0.05 (5%).

3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of someone having Adam’s personality sketch, without conditioning on the specific field, is challenging to estimate. However, given that Adam’s qualities are relatively common among students specifically selected for these traits, we might assume a moderate probability, say 0.1 (10%).

### Calculation:

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.05}{0.1} = \frac{0.035}{0.1} = 0.35 
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the field of agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.35 or 35%.
