To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we would ideally need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Since these probabilities are not explicitly given in the problem, we'll make some informed assumptions based on the information available.

Given Adam's strong curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and his appreciation for hard work, it is plausible to assume that:

- There is a relatively high likelihood that someone with these traits might be in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
- The prior probability would need to reflect the general enrollment rates in the field relative to other graduate fields, which might be lower compared to more common fields like business or engineering.

For simplicity, let's make the following assumptions:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability of Adam being in agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.1
- \( P(E|H) \) (likelihood of Adam having these traits given he is in agricultural and veterinary science) = 0.8
- \( P(E) \) (overall probability of any student having these traits) = 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Substituting the assumed values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = \frac{0.08}{0.2} = 0.4 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch E is 0.4.
