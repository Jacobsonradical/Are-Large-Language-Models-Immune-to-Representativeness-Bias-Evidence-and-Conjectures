In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in various fields and the likelihood of his personality traits given those fields. 

Unfortunately, since we do not have the specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, it is not possible to calculate the exact posterior conditional probability. However, given the description of Adamâ€™s personality sketch, it is reasonable to infer that fields related to nature, animals, and plants would have a higher likelihood.

With the given information, my qualitative assessment (not a precise computation) suggests that Adam's characteristics align well with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. So, I will provide a qualitative likelihood score that would need more precise data for exact calculation.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75
}
```

This score is a heuristic choice based on the match between Adam's personality traits and the typical interests and skills required in agricultural and veterinary science. To complete a formal Bayesian analysis, detailed prior and likelihood values are necessary.
