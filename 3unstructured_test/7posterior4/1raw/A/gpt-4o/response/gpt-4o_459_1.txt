To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science" given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in "agricultural and veterinary science".
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing \( E \).

Given that we don't have explicit numerical values for these probabilities, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - We assume that the prior probability \( P(H) \) is reasonable considering the context of Adam being a graduate student in the U.S. and his interests.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, it is quite likely that such personality traits are highly compatible with someone studying "agricultural and veterinary science".

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) \)  should take into account that such a personality sketch could belong to students of various fields, not exclusively "agricultural and veterinary science". 

Since exact probabilities are not given, the final posterior probability will be more qualitative. Based on the alignment between Adam's personality and the attributes often associated with "agricultural and veterinary science", we can assign a high qualitative posterior probability.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \Rightarrow P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \]

Here's the answer in the specified format:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
