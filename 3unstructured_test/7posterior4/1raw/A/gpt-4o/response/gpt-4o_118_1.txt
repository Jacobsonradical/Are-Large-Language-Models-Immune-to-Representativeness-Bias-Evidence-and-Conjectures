To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided. Suppose we assume the following:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Assume a reasonable value such as 0.05 (5%).
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science. Since his interests and attributes strongly align, we assign a high value, say 0.8 (80%).
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch \( E \). For simplicity, sum probabilities across different fields and assume a reasonable approximation. Let's assume this is 0.1 (10%).

Now, let's calculate:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.1} = \frac{0.04}{0.1} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch is 0.4 (or 40%).
