To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:

1. **Prior Probability, P(H)**: The initial probability of the hypothesis before taking the evidence into account.
2. **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: The probability that the evidence would be observed if the hypothesis is true.
3. **Evidence, P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we have to rely on qualitative reasoning based on the information provided. Given Adam’s interests, qualities, and background, we can make an educated guess to estimate these probabilities.

- **Prior Probability, P(H)**: Given the diversity of fields in graduate studies, we can assume a base rate for selecting agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Likelihood, P(E|H)**: Adam's personality sketch aligns well with a field that involves nature, plants, animals, and a high degree of empathy and intelligence, which is a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
- **Evidence, P(E)**: The overall fit of Adam's personality to any field of study.

Based on qualitative reasoning:
- High Prior: Adam’s interests fit well into agricultural and veterinary science fields.
- High Likelihood: His qualities and interests are highly compatible with this field.

Considering these points, we would assign a higher probability to P(H|E).

  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"

This value reflects the high compatibility of Adam’s personality with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, although it is important to note that more precise computation would require specific data.
