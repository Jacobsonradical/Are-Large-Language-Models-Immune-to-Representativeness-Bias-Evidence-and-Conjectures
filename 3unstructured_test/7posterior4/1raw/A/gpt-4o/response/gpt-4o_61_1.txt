In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we typically need a number of probabilities, including the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since this specific problem does not provide numerical values for these probabilities, it is not possible to calculate an exact numerical posterior probability. However, considering Adam's personality sketch and background, we can still qualitatively reason about the likelihood.

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work suggest a high relevance to the field of agricultural and veterinary science. Consequently, we can infer a relatively high posterior probability for him being enrolled in that field.

Given the qualitative analysis:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
```

This value reflects a strong alignment between Adam's characteristics and the typical requirements and interests of students in agricultural and veterinary science, though it remains an estimation without exact numerical inputs.
