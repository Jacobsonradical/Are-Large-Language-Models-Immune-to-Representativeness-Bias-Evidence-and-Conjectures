To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to first understand Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this scenario, we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Yet, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch of Adam and our general understanding of the fields of study.

It's important to recognize that someone with Adam's characteristics—curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles, strong empathy and love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work—might naturally incline more towards fields like biology, environmental science, or perhaps psychology.

Based on typical stereotypes and the alignment of Adam's qualities with common traits of students in business administration, it seems less likely that business administration aligns well with his detailed interests and personality traits. Business administration often involves a focus on economics, management, and strategic decision-making, which might not directly cater to Adam's strong love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving.

Therefore, without specific data but through qualitative reasoning, we can estimate a relatively low posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in business administration.

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This qualitative estimate reflects a lower likelihood compared to other possible fields more aligned with Adam's character traits.
