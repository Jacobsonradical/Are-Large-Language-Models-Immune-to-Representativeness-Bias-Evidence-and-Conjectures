To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):** The total probability of observing the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, the problem here is that we don't have concrete numerical values for the priors, likelihoods, or the marginal probabilities. For the purpose of this exercise, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Let's assume the prior probability of Adam being in business administration is a generic value because we lack specific data. 
   
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This is where we use the information from the personality sketch to judge how likely it is for someone with Adam's characteristics to be in business administration. Given Adam's interests and traits (e.g., love for nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and high intelligence in abstract concepts), he seems less likely to be in a business administration program than someone with a more analytical, nature-focused background.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \):** This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given any field of study. Given Adam's specific interests and traits, we can assume this probability might be higher for fields related to biology, environmental science, or a similar area rather than business administration.

Taking these rough qualitative assessments into account, we might estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) to be relatively low for business administration. For the sake of providing a numerical value between 0 and 1 without concrete data:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.1 \]

So the response in the requested format would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
