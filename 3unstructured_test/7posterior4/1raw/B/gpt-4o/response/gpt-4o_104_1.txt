To calculate the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\), we need to use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch, E.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all possible fields.

However, without specific numerical data for the priors and likelihoods, I can provide a qualitative estimation based on the sketch. Adam's strong interest in nature, empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts do not strongly align with typical traits of a business administration student, who might be more focused on management, economics, strategy, and market analysis.

Therefore, intuitively and qualitatively, the posterior probability can be considered low even if exact numerical calculation isn't possible.
