To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) (that Adam was enrolled in business administration) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch), we need to apply Bayes' rule as follows:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, we do not have specific values or prior probabilities directly given in the question. Therefore, we can reason qualitatively based on the personality sketch:

- Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, understanding of abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work seem to make him more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or possibly psychology. 
- Business administration typically emphasizes skills and interests such as strategic thinking, management, finance, and economics, which do not strongly align with the curiosity about nature and plants or love for animals inferred from Adam's sketch.

Given the qualitative mismatch between his personality sketch and the typical interests and skills suited for business administration, the posterior conditional probability will be relatively low.

Thus, a reasonable value can be assumed within the lower range:

  "business administration": 0.1
