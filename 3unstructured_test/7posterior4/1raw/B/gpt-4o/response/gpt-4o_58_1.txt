Unfortunately, I don't have enough specific statistical data to calculate a precise posterior probability in this context. Bayes' rule relies on numerical prior probabilities, likelihoods, and evidence, which I do not have for specific fields such as business administration.

However, based on the sketch provided, Adam's deep curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and intelligence in abstract concepts, I would hypothesize that fields closely related to natural sciences or areas involving complex problem-solving (like biology, environmental science, or mathematics) would be more probable than business administration.

So, while I can't give you an exact numerical probability, the qualitative analysis suggests that the probability for the specific field of business administration might be lower.
