To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given only the personality sketch \( E \) without numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only provide a qualitative assessment. With the descriptions provided in the personality sketch \( E \) that Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, enjoys solving puzzles, and a strong empathy, it is unlikely that Adam's traits strongly align with the typical profile of a business administration student, which may often include more commercial and strategic interests.

Thus, while we cannot compute an exact value without numerical probabilities, we can reasonably infer that the probability \( P(H|E) \) is likely to be low. Acknowledging the need for precise values, we make an educated estimate based on the qualitative alignment.

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This estimated value reflects a low likelihood, given that Adam's described interests and traits do not typically correlate with the characteristics of a business administration student.
