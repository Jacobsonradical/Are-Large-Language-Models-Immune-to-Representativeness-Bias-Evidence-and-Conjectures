To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the prior probability of the hypothesis \( P(H) \), which is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without considering the personality sketch.
2. Identify the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
3. Compute the evidence \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the personality sketch across all potential fields.
4. Apply Bayes' rule to compute \( P(H|E) \).

However, to assign specific numerical values to these probabilities, we would typically need detailed knowledge about the distribution of students' personality traits across different fields of study, which is not provided here.

Given the information provided:

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits seem less aligned with the typical traits of a business administration student, who might typically be more interested in commerce, management, finance, and related activities rather than nature, animals, and puzzles.

Using qualitative reasoning based on the fit between the personality sketch and the field in question, we might guess that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is relatively low. This reasoning assumes that Adam's traits are more common in fields more directly related to nature, animals, and logical problem-solving (e.g., biology, environmental science, or computer science).

Since exact numerical values cannot be confidently derived from the given information, I will attempt to provide a qualitative estimation for the posterior probability. Assuming a low prior and likelihood:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

This value of 0.1 reflects a relatively low probability, based on the qualitative misalignment between the personality traits and the typical student profile in the field of business administration.
