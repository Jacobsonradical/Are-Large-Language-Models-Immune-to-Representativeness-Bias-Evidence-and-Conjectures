To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to accurately compute this value, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for the field of business administration, as well as the probability of E, \( P(E) \). Without specific values, we can only provide a qualitative answer.

Given Adam's personality sketch (E) with traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems less likely he would be particularly drawn to business administration. These traits are more commonly aligned with fields like environmental science, biology, or perhaps psychology rather than business administration. 

Thus, we might infer that the likelihood \( P(E| H) \) for H being business administration is relatively low. Similarly, the prior \( P(H) \), representing the overall probability of a graduate student being in business administration, would be higher in a business school context but lower in a general context involving nature and animals. Finally, the denominator \( P(E) \), representing all probabilities that match E's description across all fields, would be dominated by more aligned fields.

Without precise numerical data, a well-informed estimate can be made assuming the prior for business administration is lower and the likelihood of E given H is also low.
