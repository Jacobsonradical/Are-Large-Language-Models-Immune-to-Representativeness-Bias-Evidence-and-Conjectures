We cannot provide an exact numerical posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods for Adam being enrolled in various fields given his personality sketch \( E \).

However, we can reason about the likelihood qualitatively given the information provided:

1. **Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants** - This suggests an inclination towards fields like biology, environmental science, or botany rather than business administration.
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles, has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals** - These traits are more aligned with fields that involve problem-solving, as well as care and empathy, such as psychology, medicine, or veterinary sciences.
3. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts** - This broad trait could fit well in many fields including business administration but paired with other traits, it might be more indicative of academic or research-oriented fields.
4. **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** - This is a trait that can be valuable in any field, including business administration.

Given these observations, Adam's characteristics seem to point more towards a scientific or academic field rather than business administration. Thus, while it is not impossible that Adam could be in business administration, it would not be the most likely field given his described personality sketch.

Let's provide a qualitative assessment in the requested format:

{
  "business administration": "Given the described personality traits, it's less likely that Adam is enrolled in business administration. A plausible estimate might place the probability on the lower side, say around 0.1 to 0.3."
