To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \). However, since we do not have concrete values for these probabilities, we can attempt a qualitative estimation based on the provided personality sketch and general knowledge.

Given the description of Adam, we have:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem to align more closely with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration. While it's not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, it appears less probable given the focus on nature, animals, and solving puzzles.

Since we don't have actual data, we will make a qualitative assessment and provide an estimated posterior probability.

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
} 

This value indicates that while it's not absolutely impossible for Adam to be enrolled in business administration, based on his personality sketch, it seems unlikely.
