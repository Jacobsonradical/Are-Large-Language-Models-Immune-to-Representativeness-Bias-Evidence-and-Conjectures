To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand and establish a few factors:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the general probability that a randomly selected graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability that a student in business administration would exhibit the traits described in Adam's personality sketch.
3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the traits described in Adam's personality sketch among all graduate students.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we do not have the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, we can logically evaluate them:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The field of business administration is one of the popular fields for graduate studies, but it is one among many. Let's assume \( P(H) \) is moderately low, perhaps around 0.1.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Given the personality traits Adam has—curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, strong empathy, love for animals, understanding abstract concepts—these traits are less stereotypical for a business administration student. Such a student might generally be expected to show keen interest in human behavior, leadership, economics, and management, but not necessarily in nature, plants, and animals.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is likely to be quite low, say around 0.01.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**:
   - This is the probability of finding a graduate student with Adam's exact personality traits across all fields. These traits might be more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, etc. Given the diversity of student populations, let's assume \( P(E) \) is moderate, say around 0.05.

Using these approximations:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = 0.02 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is approximately 0.02.
