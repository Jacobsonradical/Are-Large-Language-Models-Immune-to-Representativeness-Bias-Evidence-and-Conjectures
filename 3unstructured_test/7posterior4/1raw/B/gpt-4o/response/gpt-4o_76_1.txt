To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To provide an exact numeric value, we would require specific data about the probabilities \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\). Given that these values are not explicitly provided, a definitive computation isn't possible. However, we can discuss the characteristics provided in the personality sketch (E) and make a qualitative assessment to infer how likely it is that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- **Curiosity about nature and plants** might not directly correlate with business administration.
- **Enjoys solving puzzles** might correlate with analytical skills often valued in business.
- **Warm heart, strong empathy, and love for animals** don't have a direct connection to business administration, but could indicate interest in non-profit or corporate social responsibility roles.
- **High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts** could be useful in business studies.
- **Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication** is valuable in any field, including business.

Given these qualitative assessments and the general understanding of the field requirements, we can make an educated guess regarding the probability. However, without explicit numerical values, we can only estimate.

From the qualitative analysis, it seems Adamâ€™s interests and skills align with some aspects of business administration but also point strongly towards fields related to nature, puzzles, and empathy-related disciplines.

Given these considerations, a reasonable qualitative estimate for \(P(H|E)\) could be somewhere in the lower to mid-range.

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
``` 

This estimation reflects a lower probability, considering Adam's specific interests and personality traits, which don't predominantly align with what one might expect from a typical business administration student.
