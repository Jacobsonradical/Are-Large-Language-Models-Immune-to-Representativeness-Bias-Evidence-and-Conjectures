To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need an understanding of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the marginal probability \( P(E) \) for each hypothesis, it's not possible to provide a precise numerical value as it would require detailed statistical data.

Given the description of Adam's personality and interests, we can qualitatively evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that someone with Adam's characteristics would be enrolled in business administration. Since there is a strong emphasis on nature, empathy, animals, and intelligence related to abstract concepts, it's less aligned with the typical characteristics of someone studying business administration, which often involves more people management, economics, and organizational skills rather than a focus on nature or empathy for animals.

Based on these qualitative insights, we might infer a lower probability, but any exact numerical value would be speculative without hard statistical data. As such, a rough estimate between 0 and 1 would reflect this lesser alignment.
