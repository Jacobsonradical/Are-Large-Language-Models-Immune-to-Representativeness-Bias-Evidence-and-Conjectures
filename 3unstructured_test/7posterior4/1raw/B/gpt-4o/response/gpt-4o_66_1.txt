  "business administration": "Given the personality sketch E, the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) is difficult to quantify precisely without specific prior statistical data. However, based on Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems unlikely that business administration aligns closely with his interests and personality traits. Therefore, if I had to estimate, I might assign a low probability around 0.2."
