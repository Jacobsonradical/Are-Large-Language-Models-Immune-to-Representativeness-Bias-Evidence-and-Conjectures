To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following elements:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration without any other information.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- The evidence \( P(E) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) in general.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given data:
- \(E\): Adam's personality sketch
- \(H\): Hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration

We don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), so we need to make educated guesses based on typical characteristics of the field and the information about Adam.

1. **Prior \( P(H) \):** The probability of any given graduate student being enrolled in business administration. This can be relatively high because many students pursue business administration.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The probability of having Adam's personality traits if he were a business administration student. These traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy) might be less common for business administration students but not impossible.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \):** The overall likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch among all graduate students.

Given the specificity of Adam's traits contrasting with the typical personality traits fostered in a business administration context, it suggests a lower \( P(E|H) \). Therefore, the posterior \( P(H|E) \) is likely to be low, but not zero, as people can have wide-ranging interests.

Based on this reasoning, I will estimate the posterior probability qualitatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This estimation reflects that while it is possible for someone with Adam's personality to study business administration, it is relatively less likely given the mismatch between his interests and typical business administration characteristics.
