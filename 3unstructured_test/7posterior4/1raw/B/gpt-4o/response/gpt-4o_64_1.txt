To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is represented as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to insufficient data regarding prior probabilities \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \), it is challenging to compute an exact numerical value. Based on the description provided in E, Adam's personality traits and interests do not strongly align with the typical characteristics and inclinations of a business administration student. 

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being in business administration is likely to be quite low. While I cannot provide an exact numerical value without more data, given the personality sketch, I would estimate a low probability.
