To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in the business administration field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having his personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

However, without specific numerical values for the likelihoods and prior probabilities, we can only provide a qualitative assessment to approximate the posterior probability.

Given Adamâ€™s personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Quiet demeanor
- Enjoyment of solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem less typical for someone majoring in business administration, a field often associated with leadership, management, and commerce-related activities. Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, the posterior probability would be relatively low.

Here is the answer:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
