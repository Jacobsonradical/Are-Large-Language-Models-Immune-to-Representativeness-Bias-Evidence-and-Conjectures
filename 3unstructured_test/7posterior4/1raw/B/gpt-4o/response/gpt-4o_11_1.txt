To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in "business administration" given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to utilize Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule is formalized as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam would be enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

To solve this, we need to make some assumptions about these probabilities since specific prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided.

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Given the number of graduate fields available, let's assume the prior probability \( P(H) \) is uniform across fields. If there are \( N \) potential fields, then \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \))**: This is the tricky part. We need to assess how likely Adam's personality fits the field of business administration. Given the descriptive focus on nature, puzzles, empathy, animals, and abstract concepts, Adam's personality seems less typical for business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low compared to other fields that might align more directly with his interests.

3. **Evidence Probability (\( P(E) \))**: This is the total probability of observing Adam's personality traits, which would sum over all possible fields. 

Given these assumptions and without exact values, we still need a reasonable estimate. Here’s a possible computation considering the assumptions:

- \( P(E|H) \): Low likelihood for business administration, say 0.05.
- \( P(H) \): Assuming like any other field among approximately 20 fields, so \( \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \).
- \( P(E) \): This normalizing constant would need to sum over all fields. Let’s denote it as \( C \).

Since  \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant to ensure probabilities sum to 1, for the purpose of estimation \( P(H|E) \approx P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.05 \cdot 0.05 = 0.0025
\]

Thus, we can approximate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.0025"
}
