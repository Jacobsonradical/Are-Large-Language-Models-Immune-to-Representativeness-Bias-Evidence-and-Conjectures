To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration before any additional evidence is considered.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

While exact numerical values for these probabilities are typically required for precise computation, in this case, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Based on Adam's personality sketch (E):

- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
- He is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these attributes, a field like business administration does not seem to strongly match Adam's interests and personality traits, which are more aligned with scientific exploration, empathy towards living beings, and abstract reasoning (commonly found in fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.).

Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is relatively low.

Since we don't have specific numerical values but want to provide a probability between 0 and 1, we'll consider a qualitative assessment and estimate the posterior probability to be low (close to 0 but not 0 because Adam could still hypothetically have chosen this field).

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

This estimate, 0.1, reflects that based on his personality sketch, Adam is less likely to have enrolled in business administration compared to fields more aligned with his described traits.
