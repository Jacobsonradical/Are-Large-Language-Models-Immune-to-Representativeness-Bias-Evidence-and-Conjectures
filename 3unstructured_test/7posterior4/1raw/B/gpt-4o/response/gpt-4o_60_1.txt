To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the appropriate prior probabilities and likelihoods. Since we don't have empirical data or a defined prior distribution, I can only provide a speculative answer based on the personality sketch (E) provided.

**Bayesian Framework:**

- **P(H):** Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in Business Administration.
- **P(E|H):** Likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam is in Business Administration.
- **P(E):** Overall probability of the personality sketch E, can be found through marginalization over all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch (genuine curiosity about nature, enjoys solving puzzles, warm heart, empathy, love for animals, intelligence, appreciation for hard work), the direct inclination towards nature and abstract understanding might be more congruent with fields related to natural sciences or humanities than Business Administration.

Now, for estimation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):** Business Administration typically has a variety of students, so let's estimate a moderate prior. We could tentatively set \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** The characteristics presented for Adam do not strongly align with the common stereotypes of a Business Administration student (e.g., focus on nature and puzzles). However, they don't preclude it entirely. Let us assume a moderate likelihood for someone in Business Administration, say \( P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **Overall Probability \( P(E) \):** This is the normalization factor. To avoid complex calculations, we can consider the sum of likelihoods across all fields proportionally distributing characteristics fitting to multiple fields. Let's set it at \( P(E) \approx 1 \) for simplicity, implying no background information biases across fields.

Plugging the numbers into Bayes' Rule gives:
\[ P(H|E) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.1}{1} = 0.02 = 2\% \]

Thus, the approximate posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in Business Administration, given the personality sketch, is:
