To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities \( P(H) \) as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, these values are not provided explicitly.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and without explicit values for \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration), \( P(E|H) \) (the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in business administration), and \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the personality sketch), we can only make an educated guess to fill these in based on general knowledge.

Adamâ€™s personality sketch indicates a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, high intelligence, a quiet demeanor, an interest in solving puzzles, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. This personality profile seems to align more closely with fields like environmental science, biology, or other natural sciences rather than business administration. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the probability \( P(H|E) \) is low for Adam being enrolled in business administration. 

Based on this educated estimation:

{
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

This value (0.05) represents a low likelihood (or posterior probability) that Adam, given his personality sketch, was enrolled in business administration as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.
