To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) where \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \), we need to employ Bayes' rule, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch. 

Given Adam’s characteristics:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits align more closely with fields related to nature, science, or disciplines that require analytical and empathetic skills, rather than business administration.

For example:
- Fields like biology, environmental science, or veterinary science
- Maybe psychology or education due to his empathy and warmth
- Possibly a fit for research-oriented areas due to his high intelligence and love for solving puzzles

Given these considerations, the probability \( P(H|E) \) for business administration may be relatively low since this field typically emphasizes leadership, management, finance, and organizational skills, which don’t directly align with Adam's described interests and traits.

Here is the estimated probability in the requested format:

This is a subjective assessment and may vary with additional or different pieces of evidence.
