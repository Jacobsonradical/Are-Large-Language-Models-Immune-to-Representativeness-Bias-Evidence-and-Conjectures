To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Apple's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits, irrespective of his field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we cannot compute an exact numerical answer. 

Given Adam's personality traits, such as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for solving puzzles, high intelligence, empathy, and a deep love for animals, we can infer that these traits may not be strongly indicative of someone studying business administration. Fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might match more closely with these traits, compared to business administration.

Thus, while we cannot provide an exact number, we can infer that the probability is likely lower.

So, we might qualitatively estimate it as a low value such as:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05"
}
```

This value represents our informed guess based on the alignment (or lack thereof) between Adam's described personality and traits, and the typical qualities of a business administration student.
