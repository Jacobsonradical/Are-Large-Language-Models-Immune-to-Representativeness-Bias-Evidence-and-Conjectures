Using Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) requires both a prior probability \( P(H) \) for the hypothesis \( H \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.

However, based on the information provided, we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities. Generally, in real scenarios, domain-specific prior probabilities along with likelihoods for different fields of study would be necessary to provide an exact posterior probability. But, based on Adam's personality sketch, we can make a qualitative assessment.

Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, solving puzzles, empathy, and high intelligence especially in abstract concepts, it seems less likely that Adam would be enrolled in a field like business administration, which typically emphasizes skills and interests that are more aligned with management, finance, and economics rather than nature and abstract scientific concepts.

Thus, qualitatively, we might assess \( P(H|E) \) for business administration to be relatively low.

Here is the response in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This is a rough estimate reflecting the lower likelihood based on the given personality sketch and without actual numerical data.
