Unfortunately, I can't compute an exact numerical posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) without additional data, specifically the prior probabilities and likelihoods related to Adam enrolling in business administration. However, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch provided. 

Given Adam's deep love and curiosity for nature, plants, animals, puzzles, empathy, and understanding of hard work and dedication, it is less likely that his interests align with a field like business administration. These traits seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, or psychology.

So, qualitatively speaking, the probability \( P(H|E) \) for business administration is likely to be low.

Here is the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This value is a rough estimate based on the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality sketch and the typical attributes that might drive someone towards a career in business administration.
