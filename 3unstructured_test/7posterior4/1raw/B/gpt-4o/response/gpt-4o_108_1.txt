To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

However, since we do not have actual numerical values for these probabilities, we can't compute an exact value. Instead, I'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the likelihoods inferred from Adam's characteristics.

Adam's characteristics—such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy—seem less aligned with the typical profile for a student in business administration, which often focuses more on aspects like economics, finance, management, and organizational behavior. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) might be relatively low.

Without specific numerical values, it's not possible to compute an exact posterior probability, but it would likely be a low value. I'll provide a hypothetical estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This is an educated guess since precise computation isn't feasible without concrete prior and likelihood information.
