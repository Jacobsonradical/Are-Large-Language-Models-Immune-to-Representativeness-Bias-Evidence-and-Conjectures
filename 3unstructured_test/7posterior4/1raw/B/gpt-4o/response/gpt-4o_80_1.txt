To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field of business administration, the likelihood of his personality traits given that he is in business administration, and the overall probability of having those personality traits regardless of the field.

Here is Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits if he is indeed enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits.

Given the personality sketch (his curiosity about nature and plants, quiet disposition, love for solving puzzles, empathy, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), there is little direct alignment with typical traits expected of a business administration student. Instead, these traits seem more aligned with fields such as biology, environmental science, psychology, or other scientific fields where empathy and understanding of nature are more relevant.

Without specific numerical values, we need to use a qualitative approach. If the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is low (i.e., his personality traits are uncommon for business administration students), and the prior probability \( P(H) \) is moderate (a reasonable portion of students in the U.S. study business administration), but \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of someone having these traits) is relatively higher (i.e., these traits are more prevalent in fields related to natural sciences), the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) will be low.

Thus, considering the traits and the field mismatch, \( P(H|E) \) would fall on the lower side of the spectrum. A reasonable estimate might be:
