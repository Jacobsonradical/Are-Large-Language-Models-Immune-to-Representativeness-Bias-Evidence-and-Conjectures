To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need additional information such as the prior probability of Adam being in business administration, the likelihood of observing his personality traits given he is in that field, and the overall probability of observing such personality traits. In the absence of concrete statistical data on these parameters, we're in a speculative domain.

Let:
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Adam is studying business administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) be the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is studying business administration.
- \( P(E) \) be the marginal likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete priors and likelihoods, I can only provide a qualitative assessment. Adam's personality traits such as curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, and interest in solving puzzles do not strongly correlate with typical traits required or observed in business administration students. Given this mismatch, we can infer that the posterior probability is low.

Assuming we arbitrarily quantify "low" as 0.1 for the sake of providing an answer:

{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
