To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration given the personality sketch \( E \), we can employ Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the personality sketch.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch.

Evaluating Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciates hard work and dedication.

These traits do not strongly align with the typical profile for a graduate student enrolled in business administration, which often emphasizes skills like leadership, management, strategic decision-making, and quantitative analysis.

Based on the given personality sketch, we hypothesize that Adam's likelihood of being enrolled in business administration is relatively low. We can express this likelihood qualitatively in probabilistic terms.

Therefore, the posterior probability might be reasonably low:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This is a qualitative estimate, and precise computation would require more specific prior and likelihood data.
