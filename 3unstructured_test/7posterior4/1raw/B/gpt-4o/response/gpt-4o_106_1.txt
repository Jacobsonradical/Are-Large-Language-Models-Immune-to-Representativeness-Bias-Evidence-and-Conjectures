To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Identify the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in business administration.
3. **Identify the evidence \( P(E) \)**: This represents the total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch, considering all possible fields of study.
4. **Apply Bayes' rule**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]

Unfortunately, we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, so we will have to make educated guesses based on the information provided.

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The general interest in different fields among graduate students varies. Assuming an evenly distributed interest, let’s assign a baseline value.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam’s personality traits and interests, the likelihood of him being in business administration might be low because business administration traditionally might not align perfectly with interests in nature, puzzles, and animals.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is common for all hypotheses \( H \) and can be considered as a normalizing factor.

Given these considerations, we can estimate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for business administration to be relatively low.

Here’s a rough estimate under these considerations:
