To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several components such as the prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration (P(H)), the likelihood of E given H which is P(E|H), and the evidence P(E). 

Bayes' rule can be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, determining exact values for these probabilities typically requires detailed statistical data or expert-informed priors, neither of which are provided in this scenario. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the information given in the personality sketch (E).

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment in solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, etc., are characteristics that do not strongly correlate with typical interests or skill sets associated with business administration. So, intuitively, P(E|H) would likely be lower for business administration compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

Given the qualitative assessment, the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration might be relatively low.

Considering these points, here is a qualitative estimate:

\[ 
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
\]
