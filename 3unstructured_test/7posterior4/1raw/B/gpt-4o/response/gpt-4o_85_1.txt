Certainly! To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need more than just the information given. Specifically, we need:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. **Evidence (P(E))**: The overall probability of the personality sketch, regardless of field.

Given these elements, Bayes' rule is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, with the limited information provided, it's challenging to compute a definitive numerical value. We need specific data or assumptions about the prior probability and likelihood. Nevertheless, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis based on general assumptions regarding the fit between Adam's described personality and characteristics typical of business administration students.

Assuming:
- **P(H)** (prior probability) is relatively low, because Adam's traits (e.g., deep love for nature and animals, solving puzzles) don't strongly align with business administration.
- **P(E|H)** (likelihood) is also relatively low, since business administration programs might not typically attract individuals with Adamâ€™s specific interests.
- **P(E)** (evidence) is a normalizing constant that ensures the posterior probabilities across all fields sum to 1.

Given this qualitative assessment, we might infer a relatively low posterior probability for Adam being in business administration. 

A rough estimate without exact numbers:

{
  "business administration": 0.05
}

This estimate assumes that :
- Adam's traits are moderately weakly aligned with a typical business administration profile.
- A generic pool of graduate fields resulting in a low prior and likelihood.

For a precise value, actual statistical data would be required.
