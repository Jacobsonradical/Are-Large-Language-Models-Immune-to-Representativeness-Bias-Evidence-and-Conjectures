To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we begin with Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he was enrolled in business administration. 
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) across all fields.

Given the data provided, it is not possible to supply exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) without additional statistics. However, given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, a field like business administration seems less likely compared to fields more related to nature, animals, or abstract thinking such as biology, environmental science, or even engineering.

Therefore, we assign a very low yet non-zero probability, accounting for the unlikely but possible nature of such an enrollment:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

This represents our qualitative assessment that Adam is unlikely to be enrolled in business administration based on his personality sketch \( E \).
