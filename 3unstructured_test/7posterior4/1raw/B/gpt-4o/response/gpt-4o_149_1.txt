To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

To apply this, we will need estimates for these probabilities. Since we lack specific datasets and exact numeric values for these parameters, we'll rely on qualitative estimations.

1. **\( P(H) \) (Prior Probability)**:
   - The probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration without knowing anything else about him.
   - Let's assume that the distribution of graduate students across various fields is somewhat even. For simplicity, let’s set \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **\( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood)**:
   - The probability of observing Adam’s personality traits if he was studying business administration.
   - Business administration students may not typically exhibit a deep curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and a love for abstract concepts. Therefore, we will assign a lower value.
   - Let's estimate \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **\( P(E) \) (Evidence)**:
   - The overall probability of observing such a personality sketch in the population of graduate students.
   - Let’s assume that the personality traits described in \( E \) are relatively common among graduate students in fields like biology or the natural sciences, but less common in business.
   - For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(E) = 0.2 \).

Now apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.05 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.05 \) (or 5%).
