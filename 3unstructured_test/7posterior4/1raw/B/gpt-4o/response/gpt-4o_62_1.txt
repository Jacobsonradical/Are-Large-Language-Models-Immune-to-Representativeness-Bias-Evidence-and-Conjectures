To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. \( P(H) \) = prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \) = likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. \( P(E) \) = the total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), considering all possible fields of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To solve for this, we need specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \). These values are typically derived from data or expert knowledge, which is not provided in this question. In the absence of this data, one can only hypothesize based on the given personality sketch.

However, given Adam's strong fit with fields related to nature, puzzles, empathy, and animals, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihood.

Given these characteristics:
- High likelihood for fields related to biology, environmental science, psychology, etc.
- Lower likelihood for fields unrelated to these traits, such as business administration.

Hence, assuming a very low \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) given his personality:

\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.01 \]

So the result is:

{
  "business administration": "0.01"
