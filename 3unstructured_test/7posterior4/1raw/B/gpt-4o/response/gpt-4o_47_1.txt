To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). 

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, the question does not provide specific values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), which are necessary to perform a numerical calculation. However, we can discuss the likelihood qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch and the field in question.

Given Adam's personality traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Quiet disposition
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

It seems less likely that Adam's personality and interests would align with a field like business administration, which typically does not heavily focus on nature, animals, or solving puzzles related to those areas. 

So while we can't provide an exact numerical answer without the specific prior, likelihood, and evidence probabilities, we can make an educated guess that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for "business administration" would be relatively low.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's approximate:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
