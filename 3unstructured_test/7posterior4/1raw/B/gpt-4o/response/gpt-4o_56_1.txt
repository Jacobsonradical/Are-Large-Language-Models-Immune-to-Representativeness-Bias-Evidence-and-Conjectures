In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). 

However, these values are not provided in the question. Thus, it's impossible to calculate an exact numerical posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) without them. Instead, one might reasonably estimate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in business administration based on the details given in his personality sketch.

Considering Adam's characteristics described in the sketch:

- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Love for solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

These traits seem to align more with fields related to science, environmental studies, or fields that involve analytical thinking like biology, ecology, or even engineering, rather than business administration. That being said, empathy and understanding hard work can be qualities relevant to business administration.

Given this reasoning, the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in business administration might be considered relatively low compared to other fields aligning more closely with his described traits.

Based on this qualitative assessment, we might estimate the posterior probability as something relatively low, such as:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

This reflects a general assumption that other fields are more probable given the personality sketch of Adam, without precise numeric data to provide an exact value.
