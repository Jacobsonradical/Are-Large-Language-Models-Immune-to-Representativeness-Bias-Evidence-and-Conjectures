To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start with Bayes' theorem which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without statistical information or base rates about the probability that Adam was enrolled in different fields (like \( P(H) \)), or the likelihood that someone with Adam's personality traits would be in those fields (like \( P(E|H) \)), we cannot quantitatively determine this probability. 

Given the information provided, we can qualitatively assess that Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation of hard work) do not particularly align with what is typically expected for a student of business administration compared to fields like environmental science, biology, or psychology.

Without precise data, one approach is to state it qualitatively assuming it is highly unlikely based on the provided traits. For demonstrative purposes, this is a subjective estimation:

{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

This qualitative estimate suggests it is relatively unlikely that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch.
