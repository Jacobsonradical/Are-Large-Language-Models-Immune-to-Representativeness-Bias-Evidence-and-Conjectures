To properly compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). Given that, we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge.

Considering Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Enjoys solving puzzles.
- Strong empathy and love for animals.
- High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

These traits do not strongly align with the typical characteristics of someone enrolled in business administration, which often involves interests and skills related to management, finance, economics, marketing, or entrepreneurship.

Thus, qualitatively, we can infer that the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is relatively low. 

So based on qualitative assessments:

{
  "business administration": 0.1  // This is a rough estimate
}
