To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given Adam's personality sketch, it seems less likely that he would be enrolled in a business administration program, as his attributes (curiosity about nature, enjoyment of puzzles, empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication) suggest he might be more inclined toward fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology.

However, without specific prior probabilities or likelihood data, a precise numerical value cannot be calculated. Nevertheless, providing a qualitative estimate based on the given evidence, we would hypothesize a relatively low posterior probability for the field of business administration.

Hereâ€™s the qualitative estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This value suggests that, based on the characteristics provided, there is a low probability that Adam is pursuing a business administration degree.
