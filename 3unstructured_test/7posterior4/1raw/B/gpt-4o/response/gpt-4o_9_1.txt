Without additional specific data regarding the base rate or prior probability of Adam being enrolled in various fields, it is challenging to compute an exact posterior probability. However, I can provide a qualitative estimate based on the provided personality sketch. 

Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, puzzles, empathy, and abstract concepts suggests a field that aligns more closely with science, environmental studies, or a related discipline rather than business administration. Consequently, his likelihood of being enrolled in business administration would be relatively low.

Given these considerations, I can provide an approximate probabilistic value:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This is an estimate and would ideally be refined with additional data on the distribution of graduate students across different fields and the likelihood of someone with Adam's profile choosing business administration.
