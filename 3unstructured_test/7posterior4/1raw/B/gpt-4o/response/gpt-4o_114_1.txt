To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) for the given field of study which is Business Administration, and the total probability \( P(E) \). However, these values are not provided in the question.

Given the information, we can only qualitatively assess how well the personality sketch of Adam, \( E \), fits with the hypothesis \( H \) that he was enrolled in Business Administration. 

Adam's personality sketch suggests a strong alignment with fields involving nature, abstract thinking, animals, and empathy. These interests and traits may not strongly align with traditional Business Administration programs, which often involve fields such as management, finance, marketing, etc.

Since we don't have the actual numerical probabilities, we will provide a qualitative (subjective) low estimate for \( P(H|E) \) based on the given personality sketch which may not fit well with Business Administration.
