To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need a few components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) **: This is the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration before considering his personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) **: This is the probability of having Adam's personality sketch E given that he was indeed enrolled in business administration.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) **: This is the overall probability of Adam having such personality traits, irrespective of the field of study.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's interpret each component in light of the given data:

- **Prior \( P(H) **: Without specific data, we might assume that the probability Adam is in any given field, including business administration, is uniformly distributed among typical fields for graduate students.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) **: We would consider how likely it is for a business administration student to have Adam’s personality traits. Given that business administration often attracts individuals interested in corporate environments, teamwork, leadership, and less frequently those whose primary interests lie in nature, animals, and abstract concepts, we'd assign a relatively lower likelihood here.

- **Evidence \( P(E) **: This would be a normalizing factor that represents the overall probability of encountering Adam's personality traits irrespective of the field. Since Adam’s traits might more commonly match fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology, this could moderate the overall probability.

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis and the absence of precise numerical data, it is common to approximate these probabilities.

Let's assume:
- \( P(H) = 0.1 \) (assuming there are around 10 common graduate fields without further data)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \) (low because Adam's traits are less typical for business administration)
- \( P(E) = 0.2 \) (modest because Adam's traits are somewhat common among a variety of fields)

Using these values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.1}{0.2} = 0.025 \]
