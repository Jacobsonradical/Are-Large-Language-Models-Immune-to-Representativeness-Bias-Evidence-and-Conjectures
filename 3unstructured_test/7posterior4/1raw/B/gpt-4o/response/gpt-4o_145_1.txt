To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the prior probabilities and the likelihoods of the different fields given Adam's personality sketch. However, since the problem doesn't provide specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can’t compute an exact numerical value. Typically, the calculation involves specific data.

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Considering Adam’s personality sketch ("E") and the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration ("H"), we would need:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a student is enrolled in business administration.
2. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in business administration.
3. \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing Adam's personality sketch across all possible fields.

Because we lack numerical values for these, we can only assess qualitatively. Adam's interests in nature, puzzles, animals, and empathy suggest a profile that is more aligned with fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology rather than business administration, which typically focuses on areas such as management, finance, and strategy.

Given the qualitative mismatch, we would expect \( P(H|E) \) to be relatively low for business administration. A rough estimate without specific data might be closer to the lower end of the probability scale (i.e., significantly less than 0.5).

So, expressing this in the desired format (and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty due to the lack of specific probabilities):

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"  // This is a qualitative estimate.
}
```
