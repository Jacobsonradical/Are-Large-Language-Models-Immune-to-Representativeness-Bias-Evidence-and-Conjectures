To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we generally need the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration (\(P(H)\)), the likelihood of the evidence given this hypothesis (\(P(E|H)\)), and the overall probability of the evidence (\(P(E)\)). However, since we lack specific numerical values for these components in the problem statement, we'll provide a qualitative assessment based on the given information.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), he seems to have interests and qualities that align more with natural sciences, biology, environmental science, or related fields rather than business administration. His love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles suggests he might be more inclined towards a field involving empirical research and the natural world.

Although a precise numerical computation is not possible without data on the priors and likelihoods, we can qualitatively infer that the probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration is likely low.

Thus, we estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1"  // This is a qualitative estimate reflecting low likelihood.
}
