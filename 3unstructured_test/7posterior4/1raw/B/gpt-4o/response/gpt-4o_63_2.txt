To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
3. The prior probability \( P(E) \) of observing Adam's personality traits irrespective of the field.

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numeric values for these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative assessment.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assessing this would involve considering how likely someone in general would be enrolled in business administration. Let's assume at a graduate level, the fields are somewhat evenly distributed, but business administration might have a slightly higher enrollment due to its popularity. 

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's traits—curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence in abstract concepts, and appreciation for hard work—the personality sketch does not strongly align with the typical characteristics we might associate with business administration students, who might be more inclined towards management, economics, and less towards natural curiosity and empathy per se.

3. **Prior Probability \( P(E) \)**: This would be the general probability of someone having Adam's personality, without regard to their field of study. Since this does not directly relate to Bayes' rule calculations here but balances the probabilities, we assume it to be proportional across different fields.

Considering these qualitative assessments, we would place a lower probability on Adam being in business administration based on his personality traits.

Therefore, the probability \( P(H|E) \) that Adam was enrolled in business administration is low.
