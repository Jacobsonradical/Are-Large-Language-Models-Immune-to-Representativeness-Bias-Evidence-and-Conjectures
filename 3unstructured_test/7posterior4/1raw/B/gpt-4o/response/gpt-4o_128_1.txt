To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \), and the prior probabilities of \( H \) and \( \neg H \). However, as we lack specific prior probabilities and likelihood values in this context, an exact numeric answer is not possible with the given information. Nevertheless, we can discuss the reasoning qualitatively.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): Probability of observing personality sketch \( E \).

Without specific data, we rely on qualitative reasoning:
- Business administration students may not typically have a strong focus on nature, empathy for animals, or a love for solving puzzles, which makes \( P(E|H) \) relatively low.
- Given Adam's personality sketch, fields like biology, environmental science, or psychology might be more likely, decreasing the likelihood \( P(H) \) if the hypothesis is business administration.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is expected to be low.

An estimated, qualitative value:
\[ 
{
  "business administration": "0.1 to 0.2"
}
\]
