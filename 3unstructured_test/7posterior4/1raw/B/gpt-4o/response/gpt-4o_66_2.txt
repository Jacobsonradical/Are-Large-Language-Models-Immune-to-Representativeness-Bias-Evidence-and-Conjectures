To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need the following information:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in business administration.
3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:
- Since the exact probabilities are not provided, we will make some assumptions based on typical scenarios.
- **P(H for business administration)**: Let's assume the probability of any graduate student being enrolled in business administration is 0.15 (This is an assumption that the field of business administration is moderately common among graduate students).
- **P(E|H for business administration)**: Given the interest in business administration, let's assume the probability of having the characteristics observed in the personality sketch (interests that don't seem to strongly align with business administration) is relatively low, say 0.1.
- **P(E)**: Since it sums up the likelihood of observing E across all possible fields, letâ€™s assume it's 0.2 based on a broad range of fields.

### Calculation:
Using these assumed values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.2} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.075 \]

So, the posterior conditional probability, given our assumptions, is 0.075.
