To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch \(E\), we need to use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific information about the following probabilities, we can only make a qualitative estimate rather than a quantitative one:

1. \(P(E|H)\): The likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in business administration.
2. \(P(H)\): The prior probability of someone being enrolled in business administration.
3. \(P(E)\): The overall probability of Adam's personality traits.

Given Adam's personality sketch, he appears to have a strong inclination towards nature, empathy, and intellectual pursuits rather than towards business-oriented activities. Business administration typically requires interests and skills in management, economics, and organizational behavior, which are not particularly aligned with Adam's described traits.

Thus, I would estimate \(P(E|H)\) to be relatively low. Without exact numbers for these probabilities, I'll provide a qualitative estimate based on the provided personality sketch.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{"business administration": "0.2"}
}
