To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in business administration.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability that we would observe the given personality sketch \( E \) if the student were enrolled in business administration.
3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) regardless of the field of study.

Bayes' rule can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To provide a concrete value, we'd ideally need real data for these probabilities. However, I'll make some logical assumptions to provide a hypothetical value within the range of \( 0 \) to \( 1 \).

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**:
   Let's assume that the probability of a random graduate student being in business administration is \( 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Given Adam's detailed interest in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles, it seems less likely that he would be in a business administration program compared to fields like biology, environmental science, or similar fields. Let's assume the likelihood \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch among all graduate students. This is harder to estimate but let's assume it is reasonably common among fields like sciences and humanities. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume \( P(E) = 0.3 \).

### Calculation:
Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration given his personality sketch is approximately \( 0.067 \).
