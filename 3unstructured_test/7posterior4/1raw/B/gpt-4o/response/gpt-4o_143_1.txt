To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true before observing the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the evidence.

In this context:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( E \) represents the personality sketch of Adam.

To accurately perform this computation, we would need actual values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). In the absence of specific numerical data, we must reason qualitatively based on the provided personality sketch and typical profiles in various fields.

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The profile mentions qualities such as curiosity about nature, interest in solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals, which are not strongly aligned with traditional business administration characteristics. We might consider a low value for \( P(E|H) \).

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The prior probability \( P(H) \) could be based on general enrollment statistics for graduate students in business administration in the U.S.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of observing the evidence regardless of the field, summing over all possible hypotheses. Given the strong interest in nature and animals, it may be skewed towards fields like biology, environmental science, or similar.

Given these qualitative reasonings, we can estimate:

- \( P(E|H) \): Low, given his interests do not align well with business administration.
- \( P(H) \): Moderate to low, considering typical graduate studies distribution.
- \( P(E) \): More aligned with fields related to natural sciences.

Given the above factors, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is quite low.

Hence, the answer is:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05"
}
```
This value is a reasoned approximation based on the mismatch between Adam's personality sketch and the typical business administration profile.
