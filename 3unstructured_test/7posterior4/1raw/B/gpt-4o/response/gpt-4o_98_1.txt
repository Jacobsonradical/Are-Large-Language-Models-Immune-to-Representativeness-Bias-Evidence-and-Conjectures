To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability of Adam enrolling in business administration, the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in business administration, and the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

However, since we do not have access to the specific numerical values for these probabilities, it's challenging to compute an exact value. Instead, I will make a reasonable qualitative assessment based on Adam's personality sketch and the general characteristics of business administration students.

Adam's interests, empathy, intelligence, and love for animals seem to align less with the typical profile of a business administration student and more with fields such as environmental science, biology, or psychology. Thus, without specific numbers, I would estimate the posterior probability to be relatively low.

For the sake of providing a response within the requested format, I will assign a low value between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Please note that this is a subjective estimation rather than a precise calculation.
