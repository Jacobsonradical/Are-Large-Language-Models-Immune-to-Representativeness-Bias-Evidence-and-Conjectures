To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify \( P(E|H) \)** - The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. **Identify \( P(H) \)** - The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
3. **Identify \( P(E) \)** - The overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' Rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we're missing specific numerical values for these probabilities. In the absence of definite probabilities, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

Given Adam's personality traits and interests in nature, plants, puzzles, animals, and abstract concepts, it seems less likely that his field would be business administration, compared to fields more aligned with his interests, such as environmental sciences, biology, or perhaps mathematics or computer science due to his enjoyment of puzzles and abstract thinking.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H) \): Let's assume the prior probability that a random graduate student in the U.S. is in business administration is 0.2.
- \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's personality traits, the likelihood of those traits in someone enrolled in business administration might be lower, perhaps 0.1.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of this personality sketch among all fields might be higher due to his broad interests, let's assume 0.3.

Using these assumptions, compute \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.3} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.067 \]

Hence:
