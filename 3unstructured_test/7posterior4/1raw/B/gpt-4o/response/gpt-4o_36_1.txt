To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Given that we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we need to rely on reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   This is the probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration before considering his personality.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   This is the probability that Adam has the personality traits described in \( E \) given that he is enrolled in business administration.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**:
   This is the probability of observing the traits described in \( E \) across all possible fields of study.

For a personality sketch emphasizing a genuine curiosity about nature, strong love for animals, high intelligence, and empathy, it is less likely to align with characteristics typically associated with business administration. Business administration programs often attract individuals with interests in leadership, management, economics, and finance.

### Reasonable Assumptions:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Suppose we assume that the prior probability of being enrolled in business administration for a typical graduate student is somewhat moderate, let's say 0.2.
  
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Given the traits in \( E \), it is relatively less likely for Adam to fit perfectly into business administration. Let's assume this likelihood to be 0.05.

- **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**: This represents how common these personality traits are in the overall population of graduate students. Given the nature-oriented traits, we could consider this around 0.1.

### Bayesian Formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Calculation:

- \( P(H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.05 \)
- \( P(E) = 0.1 \)

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.1} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.1} \]

\[ P(H|E) = 0.1 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in business administration is 0.1.

Here is the formatted answer:
