To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of each hypothesis given the evidence, the prior probability of each hypothesis, and the marginal probability of the evidence. However, since we are not given specific prior probabilities or detailed likelihood functions, we will need to make reasonable estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

Given Adam's traits:

1. A genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. A warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciates hard work and dedication.

We can informally estimate the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Given Adam's strong appreciation for nature, plants, and animals, this field aligns very well with his interests and empathy towards living creatures.

### Business Administration
While Adamâ€™s intelligence would be beneficial in business administration, his strong inclination towards nature and animals does not align as well with this field. His empathy and preference for puzzles may be less relevant in this context.

### Computer Science
Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence coupled with an understanding of abstract concepts. These traits are beneficial for a field like computer science. However, his love for nature and animals does not align as directly with computer science.

Based on these considerations, we will assign relative values based on the match between Adam's personality and the field requirements.

### Assigning Relative Values:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** High match due to his curiosity about nature and empathy for animals.
- **Business Administration:** Low match due to lack of alignment with Adam's traits.
- **Computer Science:** Moderate match due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_i | E) \) as the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in field \( i \) given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E | H_i) \) as the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H_i \).

We can tentatively assign the following qualitative assessments as numerical values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the strong, moderate, and weak alignments of Adam's personality with each field respectively, based on the sketch provided. 

Given the uncertainties and lack of precise probabilities, these estimates should be treated as approximations representing the relative likelihoods.
