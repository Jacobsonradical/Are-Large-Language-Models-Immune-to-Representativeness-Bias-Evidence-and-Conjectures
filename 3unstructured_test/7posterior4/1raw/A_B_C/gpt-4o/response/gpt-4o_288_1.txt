To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, calculating the exact probabilities \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) requires specific data that isn't provided in your question. Therefore, I'll provide an estimated analysis based on logical reasoning and the personality sketch you provided.

### Prior Probabilities
Let \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Adam is in each field before considering the evidence E. Without specific data, we can assume a uniform prior or use typical enrollment data if preferred. For simplicity, we'll assume uniform priors:

\[ P(\text{business administration}) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

### Likelihoods
Next, we need to estimate \( P(E|H) \)â€”the probability of observing E given H.

- **Business Administration**: A field not generally associated with deep curiosity about nature, empathy towards animals, or puzzles.
  \[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A field closely related to Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals.
  \[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \]

- **Computer Science**: A field that aligns well with Adam's intelligence, abstract thinking, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but less directly with his love for animals and nature.
  \[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \]

### Posterior Probabilities
Now we can apply Bayes' rule to get the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for each calculation, we can compare the numerators directly:

Let's list these numerators:
- Business Administration: \( 0.1 \times \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.033 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.267 \)
- Computer Science: \( 0.5 \times \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.167 \)

Now normalize them:
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.033}{0.033 + 0.267 + 0.167} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.467} \approx 0.071 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.267}{0.467} \approx 0.572 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.167}{0.467} \approx 0.357 \]

Finally, presenting these in the desired format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.572,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
```

These probabilities reflect how well each field aligns with Adam's personality sketch.
