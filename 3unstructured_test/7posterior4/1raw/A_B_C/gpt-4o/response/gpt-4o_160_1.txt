To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need some prior information about the distribution of graduate students across these fields, as well as the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given each field. Since this data is not provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with each graduate field.

### Definitions:
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- **P(H)**: Prior probability of the hypothesis.
- **P(E)**: Marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume typical characteristics and prior probabilities for each field:

#### Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     - Likelihood (P(E|H)) of Adam's characteristics: Very high because of his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
     - Prior probability (P(H)): Let's assume this is relatively low because fewer graduate students might typically be in this field compared to the others.
2. **Business Administration**:
     - Likelihood (P(E|H)) of Adam's characteristics: Low because the personality sketch does not align well with typical business profiles.
     - Prior probability (P(H)): Moderate to high because many graduate students pursue Business Administration.
3. **Computer Science**:
     - Likelihood (P(E|H)) of Adam's characteristics: Moderate because of his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, but not a perfect fit.
     - Prior probability (P(H)): High because a significant number of graduate students are in Computer Science.

### Calculations (assumptions are illustrative and qualitative):
Based on these qualitative assumptions:
- \( P(H = \text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) \approx 0.10 \)
- \( P(H = \text{Bus. Admin.}) \approx 0.30 \)
- \( P(H = \text{Comp. Sci.}) \approx 0.30 \)

For the likelihood:
- \( P(E|\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{Bus. Admin.}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|\text{Comp. Sci.}) \approx 0.5 \)

We won't compute the exact posterior because we lack the denominator's full breakdown (\( P(E) \)), but we can provide proportional estimates of the numerator:

For illustrative purposes:
- \( P(\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) \cdot P(\text{Ag. and Vet. Sci.}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08 \)
- \( P(\text{Bus. Admin.}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Bus. Admin.}) \cdot P(\text{Bus. Admin.}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.30 = 0.06 \)
- \( P(\text{Comp. Sci.}|E) \propto P(E|\text{Comp. Sci.}) \cdot P(\text{Comp. Sci.}) = 0.5 \cdot 0.30 = 0.15 \)

Here, we can see that Computer Science in this estimation is most likely, followed by Agricultural and Veterinary Science, then Business Administration.
