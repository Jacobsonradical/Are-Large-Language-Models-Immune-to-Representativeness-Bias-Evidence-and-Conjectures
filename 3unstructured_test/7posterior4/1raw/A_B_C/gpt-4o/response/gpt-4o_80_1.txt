To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch happening, which normalizes the posterior probabilities.

However, without exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will need to rely on qualitative reasoning to generate reasonable estimates for these probabilities.

Let's reason through each field based on Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam is described as highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns well with traits commonly found in computer science students.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer Science is a popular and widely-enrolled field, especially at the graduate level.
   - Overall, there is a moderate to high chance that Adam could have been enrolled in Computer Science given his attributes.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This is a less common field compared to Computer Science and Business Administration, but Adam's specific interests and traits make this field highly relevant.
   - Overall, there is a high probability that Adam could have been enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's personality traits, such as empathy and understanding of dedication, could be beneficial in Business Administration, but other core traits like interest in nature and animals are less directly aligned.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business Administration is a very common field for graduate students, which would increase the prior probability.
   - Overall, there is a moderate probability that Adam could have been enrolled in Business Administration.

Given these considerations, here are the qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

Note that these values are qualitative estimates based on the reasoning above and would benefit from more specific data to refine the Bayesian calculations.
