To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). However, without explicit values for these probabilities, we can qualitatively assess how well Adam's characteristics align with each field and estimate the likelihoods relative to each other.

### Bayes' Rule Formula
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given Adam's personality sketch (E), we can make educated guesses about the likelihoods. Here's a qualitative assessment:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1):**
  - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, love for animals, and strong empathy, which align well with this field.
  - High likelihood \( P(E|H1) \) because his traits fit the field well.

- **Business Administration (H2):**
  - Adam's quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals don't specifically align with the typical traits associated with Business Administration.
  - Lower likelihood \( P(E|H2) \) because his traits don't fit this field as closely.

- **Computer Science (H3):**
  - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, aligning well with Computer Science.
  - High likelihood \( P(E|H3) \), but not as strong a match as Agricultural and Veterinary Science because it lacks alignment with his empathy and love for nature.

Let's assign qualitative estimates based on these considerations, noting they aren't precise probabilities but educated estimates:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
