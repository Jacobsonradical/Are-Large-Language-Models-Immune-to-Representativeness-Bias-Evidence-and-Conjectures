To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of specialization using Bayes' rule, let's briefly outline the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: The likelihood of Adam being in a particular field before considering his personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: The likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch if he were in a given field.
3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: The overall likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch across all fields.

Given the lack of specific numerical data, I will make reasonable qualitative assumptions to estimate these probabilities.

### Bayesian Formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are based on typical graduate enrollments.
   - For simplicity, let's assume a general uninformative prior; each field has an equal starting probability.
2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is estimated from how well Adam’s personality matches the typical profiles.

### Roles:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): High, given Adam’s love for nature and animals.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \): Moderate, as this field is less common compared to others like business or computer science.
2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Low, as Adam’s personality does not correlate strongly with typical business traits.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): High, as business programs are commonly enrolled.
3. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate to high, due to his intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving tendencies.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): High, as computer science programs are very popular.

### Estimations:
Assume:
\[ P(E) \approx \sum P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

I will provide estimated probabilities based on these assumptions:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}

Where:
- For **AVS**:
  - High likelihood (e.g., 0.8) \(\times\) moderate prior (e.g., 0.1) / average evidence.
- For **BA**:
  - Low likelihood (e.g., 0.2) \(\times\) high prior (e.g., 0.4) / average evidence.
- For **CS**:
  - Moderate to high likelihood (e.g., 0.6) \(\times\) high prior (e.g., 0.4) / average evidence.

These estimations assume average evidence normalizing factors and general grad program trends. Adjustments can be made with more specific prior or likelihood data.
