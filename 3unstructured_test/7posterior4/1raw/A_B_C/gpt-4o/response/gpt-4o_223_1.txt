To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have the actual numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we'll make qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are supportive.
   - Interest in puzzles is a plus.
   - However, no specific mention of interest in technology or computer-specific activities.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong match due to genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - High empathy aligns with caring for animals.
   - Appreciation for hard work, common in agricultural practices.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - High intelligence could fit.
   - Empathy can be an asset in leadership and team management.
   - However, no specific mention of an interest in business, finance, or organizational behavior.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

\[ \text{Let P(H)} \sim 0.1 \text{ (approx prior probability for each field)} \]

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is moderate based on intelligence and puzzle-solving.
     : \( P(E|H) \sim 0.4 \)
   - Posterior:
     : \( P(H|E) \approx 0.4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.04 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high based on multiple matching traits.
     : \( P(E|H) \sim 0.7 \)
   - Posterior:
     : \( P(H|E) \approx 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is low to moderate based on empathy but less direct match than other fields.
     : \( P(E|H) \sim 0.3 \)
   - Posterior:
     : \( P(H|E) \approx 0.3 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 \)

Thus, the approximated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "business administration": 0.03
}
