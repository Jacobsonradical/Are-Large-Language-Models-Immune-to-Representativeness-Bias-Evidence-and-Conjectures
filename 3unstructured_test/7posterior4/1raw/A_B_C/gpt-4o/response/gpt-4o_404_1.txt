To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being in each field and how well the personality sketch \( E \) aligns with the hypothesis \( H \) that Adam is enrolled in that field.

However, without specific values for the priors and the likelihood (how likely Adam's traits are given each field), we can't compute exact values. Instead, we can reason qualitatively to provide estimates based on how well his personality traits align with each field. 

Let's denote:

* \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
* \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of the hypothesis.
* \( P(E) \) as the marginal likelihood (which we don't need for relative comparison).

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assess each field based on the given personality traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for dedication and hard work, which align very well with this field.
    - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
    - Assume \( P(H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is moderate among graduate students due to specialized nature.
    
2. **Computer Science**
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with computer science. However, his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature are less directly aligned with this field.
    - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.
    - Assume \( P(H) \) is high, considering computer science's popularity among graduate students.

3. **Business Administration**
    - Adam's personality sketch mentions empathy and warmth, which can be beneficial. However, the sketch does not highlight traits that are explicitly aligned with business administration fields (e.g., organizational skills, interest in economics).
    - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is low to moderate.
    - Assume \( P(H) \) is moderate to high due to its commonality among graduate students.

Putting these together with qualitative reasoning (not exact values), we get the posterior relative probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.50,
  "business administration": 0.30
}

These values reflect how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field based on qualitative reasoning.
