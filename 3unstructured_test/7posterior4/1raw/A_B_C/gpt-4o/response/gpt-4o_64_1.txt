To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we should use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is mathematically expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given that we do not have specific numeric values for these probabilities, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch of Adam and typical attributes related to those fields.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Computer Science often involves high intelligence and abstract thinking, but it typically does not relate strongly to empathy, a deep love for animals, or a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Computer Science is a popular field, so the prior might be moderately high.

   Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) for Computer Science might not be significantly high due to the lack of alignment with all aspects of Adam's personality.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** This field aligns closely with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** This field might generally have fewer students compared to fields like Computer Science, affecting the prior probability.

   Thus, \( P(H|E) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science is likely to be high.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Business Administration requires intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, but it typically isn't strongly related to empathy, a love for animals, or curiosity about nature.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Business Administration is also a popular field, which might give it a moderate prior probability.

   Consequently, \( P(H|E) \) for Business Administration might be lower than Agricultural and Veterinary Science but could be higher than Computer Science due to the alignment with some aspects of Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking skills.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative fit of Adam's personality with each field, favoring Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to its strong alignment with his described traits.
