To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have exact data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can make educated estimations based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge of the field's characteristics. Let's consider each field individually:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and deep love for animals, it's highly likely he might be interested in this field. The abstract understanding and high intelligence could also align well with research in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration:**

The profile describes Adam as a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles, which somewhat aligns with the analytical skills needed for business administration. However, the emphasis on nature, animals, and a warm heart makes this field less likely compared to the others.

3. **Computer Science:**

Adam's high intelligence and comfort with abstract concepts suggest a potential aptitude for computer science. However, the profile's focus on nature, plants, and animals makes it seem less likely that his primary interest lies in computer science compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

Given these insights, here are the estimated conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These are subjective estimations based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of each field.
