To compute the posterior probabilities, we need Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence.

To simplify the process, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors, as we do not have exact numerical values. Here's a qualitative assessment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: The probability of Adam having the personality traits given that he is in business administration might be lower, as business administration doesn't typically emphasize nature, empathy, or animals.
   - **P(H)**: Prior probability might be moderate but possibly lower than the other fields due to Adam's interest in nature and animals.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Very high, as this field aligns well with Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and animals.
   - **P(H)**: Prior probability might be moderate to high due to Adam's strong interest in nature and animals.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Given his quiet and puzzle-solving nature, this could be fairly high. However, the love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - **P(H)**: Prior probability might be moderate, given his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.

Given this qualitative assessment, and without exact numerical data, we can estimate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These are rough estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the characteristics typically associated with these fields.
