To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is Adam's personality sketch.

To determine \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we require:
1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given he is enrolled in that field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in that field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's personality sketch.

While \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \) can be estimated from available data on the frequency of graduate fields and the general occurrence of such a personality sketch, here we focus more intuitively due to lack of specific numbers.

Given Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, intelligence, understanding of hard work) and considering the fields in question, we'll make qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - High likelihood since it aligns with natural curiosity and love for animals.
2. **Business Administration:**
   - Lower likelihood as Adam's traits donâ€™t strongly correlate with typical business administration traits.
3. **Computer Science:**
   - Moderate likelihood since puzzle-solving and intelligence align with computer science, but love for nature/animals is less relevant.

Using these qualitative assessments:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{P(E|H, Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} \approx 0.7 \\
&\text{P(E|H, Business Administration)} \approx 0.2 \\
&\text{P(E|H, Computer Science)} \approx 0.5 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

If we assume an equal distribution of graduate students across these fields, \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{N} \) for simplicity. For three fields:

\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \]

We can ignore normalizing \( P(E) \) for relative comparisons:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H|E, \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) &\propto 0.7 \cdot 0.33 = 0.231 \\
P(H|E, \text{Business Administration}) &\propto 0.2 \cdot 0.33 = 0.066 \\
P(H|E, \text{Computer Science}) &\propto 0.5 \cdot 0.33 = 0.165 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, using relative values:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{0.231}{(0.231 + 0.066 + 0.165)} \approx 0.511 \\
&\frac{0.066}{(0.231 + 0.066 + 0.165)} \approx 0.146 \\
&\frac{0.165}{(0.231 + 0.066 + 0.165)} \approx 0.364 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

However, acknowledging qualitative inputs:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{P(H|E, Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} \approx 0.55 \\
&\text{P(H|E, Business Administration)} \approx 0.10 \\
&\text{P(H|E, Computer Science)} \approx 0.35 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

This refined approximation:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
