To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing his personality sketch given that he is in each field. However, given that the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are not provided, we will make some reasonable assumptions for \( P(H) \) based on general knowledge of graduate field enrollments and adjust them according to his personality traits detailed in \( E \).

Here are the assumptions and estimates for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's traits such as a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, a warm heart, and strong empathy align strongly with this field.
    - Assumed Prior \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): 0.10 (10%)
    - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \): 0.8

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts may align with computer science, but other traits such as curiosity about nature and empathy may be less relevant.
    - Assumed Prior \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \): 0.20 (20%)
    - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \): 0.3

3. **Business Administration**: Adam's traits of empathy and understanding appreciation for hard work can be relevant, but his strong connection with nature, animals, and puzzles makes this field less likely.
    - Assumed Prior \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \): 0.15 (15%)
    - Likelihood \( P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \): 0.2

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant across comparisons, we can ignore it and use the numerator for relative comparison:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, calculate the unnormalized posteriors:
\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.10 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) \propto 0.3 \cdot 0.20 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Normalize the probabilities by dividing by the sum of these values:
\[ \sum = 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.17 \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.17} \approx 0.47 \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.17} \approx 0.35 \]
\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.17} \approx 0.18 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
