To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, due to the lack of specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Based on Adam's personality sketch, certain traits are more aligned with particular fields of study:

- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: This trait is broadly applicable but can be particularly valuable in computer science.
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication: These traits align closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Strong empathy and warm heart: These traits might not strongly point towards business administration, which is more commercially and economically focused.

Given this qualitative assessment, here are the posterior probabilities represented as subjective probabilities between 0 and 1:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood that Adam's interests and traits point toward agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and lastly business administration.
