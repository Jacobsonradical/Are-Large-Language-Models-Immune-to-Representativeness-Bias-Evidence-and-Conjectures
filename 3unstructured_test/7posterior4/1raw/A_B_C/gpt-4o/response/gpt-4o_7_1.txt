To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \)** for each hypothesis \( H \) based on general enrollment data.
2. **Determine the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**, which is the probability of observing E given H.
3. **Compute the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)**, which is the overall probability of observing E.
4. **Apply Bayes' rule**: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \).

Given that we don't have specific statistics for these probabilities, we'll make reasoned guesses based on general knowledge and the information given in E.

### Assumptions
1. **Priori (general guesses):**
   - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.05 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.20 \)
   - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.15 \)
   
2. **Likelihood based on personality sketch E:**
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is likely high given his interest in nature, plants, and animals. Let's assign it 0.8.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is likely low since E shows no particular inclination toward business interests. Let's assign it 0.1.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate as he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence. Let's assign it 0.6.

3. **Marginal Likelihood**: \( P(E) \) can be estimated as the sum of the weighted likelihoods considering priors.
   
\[ 
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})
\]

\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.05) + (0.1 \cdot 0.20) + (0.6 \cdot 0.15) 
\]

\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.04 + 0.02 + 0.09 = 0.15 
\]

### Bayes' Rule Application:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.15} \approx 0.267 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{0.15} \approx 0.133 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.15}{0.15} \approx 0.600
\]

Given these calculations, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "business administration": 0.133,
  "computer science": 0.600
}
```

These values represent our calculated posterior probabilities based on the information given in E and our assumptions about the priors and likelihoods.
