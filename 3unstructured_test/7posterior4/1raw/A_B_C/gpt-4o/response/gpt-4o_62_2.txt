To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence E.

To simplify this calculation, we'll make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the total probability \( P(E) \).

Assumptions:
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability that Adam's characteristics fit those of a computer science student. Let's estimate this to be moderate (0.3), given his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Prior probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in computer science. We'll estimate this to be moderate (0.2).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Probability that Adam's characteristics fit those of a student in agricultural and veterinary science. Given his love for animals and nature, we'll estimate this to be high (0.7).
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Prior probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in agricultural and veterinary science. We'll estimate this to be low to moderate (0.1).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Probability that Adam's characteristics fit those of a business administration student. Given Adam's characteristics, this seems less likely (0.1).
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Prior probability of a randomly selected graduate student being in business administration. We'll estimate this to be moderate (0.2).

4. \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence E.

Since we are interested in relative probabilities, the exact value of \( P(E) \) is not necessary. Instead, we focus on the product \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field and normalize them to get a sense of the relative likelihoods.

Computations (scaled for relative comparison):

- **Computer Science**:
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \]
  
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.07 \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.02 \]

Normalized probabilities (for relative comparison):
- The sum of the products is \( 0.06 + 0.07 + 0.02 = 0.15 \).
- Relative probabilities:
  \[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.4 \]
  \[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.15} = 0.47 \]
  \[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.15} = 0.13 \]

Based on the relative calculations, we get the following posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.40,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.13
