To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compare how well each field explains Adam's personality sketch versus the base rate probability of each field among all graduate students.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given the qualitative nature of the information, we will make some assumptions and estimations based on how well the description fits each field.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam shows high intelligence and an interest in solving puzzles, which could correlate with skills required in computer science.
   - However, there's no strong evidence pointing directly to computer science-specific interests.

   Therefore, let's assume:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \] (somewhat fitting)
   \[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \]
   \[ P(E) \] (common across all fields, arbitrary normalization)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a warm heart, strong empathy, and a love for animals. These traits highly correlate with interests in agricultural and veterinary science.

   Therefore, let's assume:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \] (highly fitting)
   \[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \]
   \[ P(E) \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam's personality sketch lacks traits typically associated with business administration (like interest in management, finance, etc.).
   - While Adamâ€™s intelligence and understanding of dedication could be applicable, the tie is relatively weak.

   Therefore, let's assume:
   \[ P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \] (weakly fitting)
   \[ P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.25 \]
   \[ P(E) \]

However, \( P(E) \) cancels out when comparing probabilities since it is a common term. We then normalize the results to make the sum of the probabilities add up to 1.

So, using \( P(E) \) to normalize,
\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.2 = 0.08 \\
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \\
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these values gives the normalization factor:
\[ 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.21 \]

Now, let's normalize these probabilities:
\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) & = \frac{0.08}{0.21} \approx 0.38 \\
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) & = \frac{0.08}{0.21} \approx 0.38 \\
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) & = \frac{0.05}{0.21} \approx 0.24
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the posterior probabilities are approximately:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.38,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.38,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```
