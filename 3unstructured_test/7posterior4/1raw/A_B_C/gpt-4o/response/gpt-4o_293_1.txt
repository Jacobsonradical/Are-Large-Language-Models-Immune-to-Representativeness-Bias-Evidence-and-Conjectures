To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know or estimate several pieces of information:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the observed personality sketch given the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in each specific field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the observed personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical data for these terms, we'll make qualitative assessments to provide rough estimates based on the provided personality sketch.

### Assessments for Each Field
1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The description of Adam doesn't strongly align with typical traits specific to business administration students (e.g., leadership, networking focus). Hence, \( P(E|H) \) may be low.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: The general enrollment rate for business administration could be considered moderate.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam's interest in nature, plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals align well with this field. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Enrollment in this field may be lower compared to more common fields like business administration or computer science.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills align well with computer science, the empathy and nature interests are less relevant. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Enrollment in computer science is typically high.

Given these assessments, probabilities are estimated as follows (note these are rough qualitative assessments):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

### Reasoning
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits don't align strongly with the typical skills or interests in business administration, resulting in a low probability.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's traits are highly consistent with this field, given his love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy.
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align moderately with computer science, balanced by his less relevant nature interests.
