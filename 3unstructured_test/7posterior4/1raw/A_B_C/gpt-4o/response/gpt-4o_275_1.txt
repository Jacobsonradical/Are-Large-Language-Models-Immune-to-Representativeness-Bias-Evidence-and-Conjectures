To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we would use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in that field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Adam's personality sketch, which is the same for all hypotheses and can be normalized out when comparing the probabilities.

Because we don't have specific prior probabilities or exact likelihoods and we're doing this based on qualitative reasoning, we will make educated guesses based on the consistency between Adam's traits and what is typically valued in each field.

### Key considerations from the personality sketch:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals.
- Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Likelihoods and assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Highly consistent with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy.
2. **Business Administration**: Less consistent with Adam's emotional traits and nature interests, though his intelligence and appreciation for hard work may align.
3. **Computer Science**: Consistent with Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, although less aligned with his empathy and nature interests.

Given this, we can now make rough estimations for the posterior probabilities based on these qualitative assessments.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** receives the highest probability because it directly aligns with multiple key aspects of Adam's personality.
- **Business Administration** receives the lowest probability because it least aligns with the given traits.
- **Computer Science** has a moderate fit based on his intellectual and problem-solving abilities, though it lacks direct relevance to his nature and empathy traits.

These values are subjective estimates and should ideally be refined with more specific data.
