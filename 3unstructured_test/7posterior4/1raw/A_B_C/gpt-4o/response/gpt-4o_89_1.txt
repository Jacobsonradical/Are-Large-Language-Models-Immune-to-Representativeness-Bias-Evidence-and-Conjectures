To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, given the context of this problem, we don't have these exact numerical values. Instead, I will provide qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch E described and the relevance of each field of study.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high (Popular field of study).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low (The personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration interest).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate (Niche field of study).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High (Adam's love for nature, animals, and empathy aligns strongly with this field).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: High (Popular field of study).
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to high (Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and understanding of abstract concepts aligns with this field).

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are illustrative and qualitative estimates, prioritizing alignment with the personality sketch over exact numerical computations.
