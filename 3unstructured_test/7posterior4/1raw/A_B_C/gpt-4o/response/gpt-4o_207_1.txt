To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or the exact likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) for each field, I will provide some reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with each field.

Let's assume the prior probabilities for simplicity:
- \( P(agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science) \approx 0.2 \) 
- \( P(computer \ science) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(business \ administration) \approx 0.3 \)

Now we estimate \( P(E|H) \) for each field based on Adam's characteristics:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are highly relevant.
   - High likelihood: Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{ag}) \approx 0.8 \).

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts fit well.
   - Moderate likelihood: Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.6 \).

3. **Business Administration**: 
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are relevant, but other attributes are less directly related.
   - Lower likelihood: Let's estimate \( P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.4 \).

Since we don't have the exact \( P(E) \) (i.e., the total probability of the personality sketch across all fields), we can compute relative probabilities instead of absolute ones. Essentially, we won't be able to normalize to sum to 1 but can compare the relative likelihoods.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We calculate:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{ag}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{ba}|E) \propto 0.4 \times 0.3 = 0.12 \]

While these values can be normalized to sum to 1, our objective is to show relative likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) = \{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.12
\} \]

Hence, the relative probabilities based on the personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.16,
  "computer science": 0.18,
  "business administration": 0.12
}
```

This suggests that computer science is slightly more likely given Adam's personality traits, followed by agricultural and veterinary science, and then business administration.
