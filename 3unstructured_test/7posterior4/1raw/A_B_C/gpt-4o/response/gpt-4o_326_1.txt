In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field and the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of the personality sketch given the field. Without specific data, I'll make educated estimations based on the given personality sketch and the nature of the fields. 

First, recall Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assume \(P(E)\) is the same for all fields, and focus on estimating \(P(E|H)\) and \(P(H)\):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are less common, so let's estimate a moderate prior.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy, it's very likely he'd be in this field.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - \(P(H)\): Business administration is a very common graduate field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Adam's characteristics don't strongly align with typical business administration traits, where empathy and love for nature aren't primary aspects.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \(P(H)\): Computer science is a very common graduate field.
   - \(P(E|H)\): Given his high intelligence, puzzle-solving, and understanding abstract concepts, Adam could fit well in computer science, though his empathy and nature interests are less directly relevant.

Let's apply this reasoning to estimate probabilities while keeping in mind that we're working with educated guesses:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}

These values are reflective of Adam's personality sketch fitting best with agricultural and veterinary science, somewhat less so with computer science, and least with business administration.
