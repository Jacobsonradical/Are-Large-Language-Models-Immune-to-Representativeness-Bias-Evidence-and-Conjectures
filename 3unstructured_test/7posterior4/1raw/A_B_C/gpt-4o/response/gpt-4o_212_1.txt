To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, I need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \) to perform the actual calculations. Given that the values for these probabilities are not provided, we can only estimate them qualitatively based on the given description of Adam's interests and personality.

Given Adam's traits, like curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and empathy, it's more likely for him to be in a field that aligns with these characteristics. Here are the estimations ranked primarily by compatibility with the provided traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field is highly compatible with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high. Assuming he opts for a field aligned with his interests naturally increases \( P(H) \).
2. **Computer Science**: Though not directly tied to his love for plants and animals, Adam's intelligence, affinity for solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with this field, giving a moderately high \( P(E|H) \).
3. **Business Administration**: This field appears less aligned with Adam's described interests and empathy. Although he possesses the strong understanding and appreciation of hard work and dedication needed in business, factors like his empathy and nature curiosity make this less likely, resulting in a relatively lower \( P(E|H) \).

Based on this qualitative analysis, we can estimate the conditional probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Please note that these values are heuristic and would need specific data to carry out exact calculations.
