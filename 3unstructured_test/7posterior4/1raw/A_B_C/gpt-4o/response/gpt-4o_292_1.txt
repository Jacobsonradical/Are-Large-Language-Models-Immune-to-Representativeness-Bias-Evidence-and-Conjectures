To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the likelihood of each field given Adam's personality sketch (E) and the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field. Unfortunately, we do not have specific data to calculate these values numerically. Nonetheless, we can make a reasonable qualitative assessment based on Adam’s characteristics.

### Using Bayes' Rule
Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence or marginal likelihood.

Since actual prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) aren't provided, the values I'll provide will be based on logical inference from the description.

### Qualitative Assessment

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **Properties:**
        - Strong alignment with Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants.
        - Good match with his love for animals and empathy.
    - **Qualitative probability:** High likelihood since this field closely aligns with his interests and personality.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - **Properties:**
        - Moderate alignment with his interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
    - **Qualitative probability:** Moderate likelihood as it aligns somewhat with his analytical skills but less so with his interests in nature, animals, and empathy.

3. **Business Administration:**
    - **Properties:**
        - Low alignment with described personality traits.
        - This field typically requires a strong focus on economics, management, and analytical skills rather than the interests indicated.
    - **Qualitative probability:** Low likelihood since it doesn't directly align with his described characteristics.

### Quantitative Approximation
Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Please note these values are estimations based on logical inference rather than precise calculations.
