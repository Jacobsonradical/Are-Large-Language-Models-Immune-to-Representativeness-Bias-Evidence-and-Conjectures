To compute the posterior probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we'll need to consider both the likelihood of observing the evidence given each hypothesis and the prior probabilities of each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we will use qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align with a field like computer science, which often involves abstract thinking and problem-solving.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is a relatively common field of study.
   - **P(H|E)**: Moderate to high probability due to alignment in skills but a lesser focus on nature.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: While business administration might involve understanding abstract concepts, it typically does not involve a deep connection with nature or animals.
   - **P(H)**: Quite common among graduate students.
   - **P(H|E)**: Lower probability given the mismatch in core interests and subject matter with Adam's personality sketch.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Strong alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **P(H)**: Less common than computer science and business administration, but not rare.
   - **P(H|E)**: High probability due to the strong alignment with Adam's interests and traits.

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, the estimated probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

This superficially rationalizes that Adam is most likely enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science given his personality sketch, with moderate chances for computer science, and a lower likelihood for business administration.
