To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

However, in the context of this problem, we do not have specific values for the priors \( P(H) \) (the probability that Adam would be in each field before knowing his personality traits), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of Adam having these personality traits given that he is in each field), and the evidence \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of Adam having these traits irrespective of his field). 

Given this, I will make qualitative evaluations based on the provided personality sketch and typical educational field characteristics.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business students are generally expected to have skills in leadership, management, and often enjoy working directly with people, numbers, or businesses.
   - Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work) do not align strongly with business administration.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field would match Adam's traits well, given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and potential interest in plants.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer science requires strong problem-solving skills, intelligence, and the capability to understand abstract concepts. Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence fit this field.
   - However, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature seem less directly related.

Given these considerations, I will provide qualitative estimates rather than precise probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.4"
}
```

These values are based on the relative alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics and interests associated with each field.
