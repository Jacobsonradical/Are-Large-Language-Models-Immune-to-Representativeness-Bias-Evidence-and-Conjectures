To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), I can only provide qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch and the characteristics of different fields of graduate study.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy, this field seems highly aligned with his interests and strengths.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam has high intelligence and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, the personality sketch does not mention specific traits or interests typically associated with business administration, such as a focus on leadership, management, or finance.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests he might be inclined towards computer science, although there is no specific mention of an interest in technology or computing in the sketch.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are my estimated posterior probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
