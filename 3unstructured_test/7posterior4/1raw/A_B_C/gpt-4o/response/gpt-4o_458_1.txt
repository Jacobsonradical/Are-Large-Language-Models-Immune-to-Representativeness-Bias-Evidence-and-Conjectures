To calculate the posterior probabilities, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given the field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, without specific prior probabilities or likelihoods from a larger dataset, we'll make educated guesses based on the personality sketch provided. These educated guesses are qualitative rather than precise, but they'll give us insight into the relative likelihoods.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Less likely because Adam's inherent traits (e.g., love for animals, curiosity about nature) do not align strongly with typical business administration traits.
   - \( P(H_{business}) \): We'll assume a moderate prior, as business administration is a common graduate program.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Somewhat likely given his intelligence, quiet nature, and enjoyment of puzzles. Abstract thinking is also a key aspect of computer science.
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Moderate prior, as computer science is a popular field.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{ag_vet}) \): Very likely, as it aligns closely with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H_{ag_vet}) \): Possibly lower prior than business administration and computer science due to fewer students in this field, but still reasonable.

Given these considerations and assuming vague priors, let's provide qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are rough qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch provided. Accurate computation would require more detailed statistical data.
