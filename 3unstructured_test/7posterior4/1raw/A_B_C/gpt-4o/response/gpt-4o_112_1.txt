To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each of the given fields, we will utilize Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), or \(P(E)\), I'll base the approximate values on the information given in the personality sketch and general knowledge. 

1. **Probability of Adam being in Agricultural and Veterinary Science (\(H_A\)):**
   - **Prior probability, \(P(H_A)\):** This field is not exceedingly common among all possible graduate fields, so let's assume a moderate prior of 0.10.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_A)\):** Given his interest in nature, plants, and animals, there is a high likelihood of this fit, say 0.70.
   
2. **Probability of Adam being in Business Administration (\(H_B\)):**
   - **Prior probability, \(P(H_B)\):** Business administration is a common graduate field, so let's assume a higher prior of 0.20.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_B)\):** Given his personality sketch, there is less indication that business administration is a good fit, so let's use 0.10.
   
3. **Probability of Adam being in Computer Science (\(H_C\)):**
   - **Prior probability, \(P(H_C)\):** Computer science is also a popular field, so another high prior of 0.20.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_C)\):** His intelligence and knack for solving puzzles fit well with computer science, so we consider a higher likelihood of 0.60.

We assume that \(P(E)\), the total probability of the evidence, is a constant, which can be ignored for comparative purposes. We'll normalize the probabilities afterward.

Now, let's calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_A|E) \propto P(E|H_A) \cdot P(H_A) = 0.70 \cdot 0.10 = 0.07 \]
\[ P(H_B|E) \propto P(E|H_B) \cdot P(H_B) = 0.10 \cdot 0.20 = 0.02 \]
\[ P(H_C|E) \propto P(E|H_C) \cdot P(H_C) = 0.60 \cdot 0.20 = 0.12 \]

To find the normalized probabilities:

\[ Total = 0.07 + 0.02 + 0.12 = 0.21 \]

\[ P(H_A|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.21} ≈ 0.33 \]
\[ P(H_B|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.21} ≈ 0.10 \]
\[ P(H_C|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.21} ≈ 0.57 \]

Here are the values in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.57
}
