To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break this down into the steps required to estimate the probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of each hypothesis (field) before considering the personality sketch.

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Graduate students in agricultural and veterinary science might be a small subset of all graduate students. Let's assume \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.1 \).
   - **Business Administration**: Business administration is a very common graduate field. \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \).
   - **Computer Science**: Computer science is also quite popular among graduate students. \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.2 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the personality sketch given each field. 

   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, the likelihood is quite high. \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \approx 0.8 \).
   - **Business Administration**: The personality traits described don't align closely with typical traits associated with business administration. \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - **Computer Science**: Interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well, but the preference for nature and animals is less typical. \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.5 \).

3. **Evidence, \( P(E) \)**: This is the overall probability of the personality sketch irrespective of the field. To simplify our calculation, let's assume it's the sum over all fields, weighted by their priors and likelihoods.

\[ 
P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) 
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ 
P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.1) + (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.1 
\]
\[ 
P(E) \approx 0.24 
\]

Finally, we compute the posterior probabilities for each hypothesis:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.24} \approx 0.333
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.24} = 0.25
  \]

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.24} \approx 0.417
  \]

So, the approximated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.25,
  "computer science": 0.417
}
```
