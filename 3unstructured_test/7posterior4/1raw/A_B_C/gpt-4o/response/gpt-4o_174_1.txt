To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will consider the given personality sketch \( E \) of Adam and update our belief about the fields he might be enrolled in.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in field \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \), which can be computed as \( \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \) across all possible fields \( H_i \).

To estimate these probabilities without specific data for priors and likelihoods, we need to rely on assumptions based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, as a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and high empathy are strong indicators.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, as graduate programs in agricultural and veterinary science are common but not as widely enrolled as some other fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low, as the personality traits described (love for nature, animals, and puzzles) do not strongly align with typical characteristics or required traits for a business administration student.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: High, as business administration is one of the most common graduate programs.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to high, as high intelligence, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts are aligned with computer science. However, love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high, as computer science is a very popular and common field of graduate study.

Given these qualitative assessments, the likely posterior probabilities would look something like this, without actual numeric prior and likelihood data:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect high alignment with the personality sketch for agricultural and veterinary science, some alignment with computer science, and low alignment with business administration based on the provided information, thus leading to the calculated probabilities.
