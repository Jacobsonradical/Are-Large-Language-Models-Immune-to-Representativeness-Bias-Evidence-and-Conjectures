To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and then apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that specific values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, I'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on common knowledge:

1. Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for fields of study in graduate programs in the U.S. are as follows:
   - Business Administration: 0.20
   - Computer Science: 0.25
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.05

2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which means the probability of Adam's personality sketch given each field, can be estimated based on how well his traits align with each field. We'll assume:
   - Business Administration: 0.10 (less likely due to Adam's interests in nature and animals)
   - Computer Science: 0.30 (more likely given his love for puzzles and high intelligence)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.70 (most likely given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy)

3. \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant such that the sum of the posterior probabilities is 1:

\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]

Now, let's compute the values:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.10 \times 0.20}{P(E)} \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.25}{P(E)} \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AV}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.70 \times 0.05}{P(E)} \]

First, compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.10 \times 0.20) + (0.30 \times 0.25) + (0.70 \times 0.05) = 0.02 + 0.075 + 0.035 = 0.13 \]

Now, use \( P(E) \) to find the posterior probabilities:

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.13} \approx 0.154 \]

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.13} \approx 0.577 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{AV}}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.13} \approx 0.269 \]

These probabilities can be represented as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.154,
  "computer science": 0.577,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.269
}
```

These reflect the likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch.
