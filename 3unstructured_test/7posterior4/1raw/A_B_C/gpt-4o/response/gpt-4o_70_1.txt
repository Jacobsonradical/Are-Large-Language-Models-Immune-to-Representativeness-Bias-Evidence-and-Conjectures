To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to start by understanding Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant ensuring the probabilities sum to 1.

Since explicit numerical values for the priors and likelihoods aren't provided, we must make qualitative estimates informed by the sketch of Adam and typical characteristics of each field.

### Steps:
1. Estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis based on how well Adam's profile matches typical traits for students in each field.
2. Estimate priors \( P(H) \) based on general graduate enrollment distributions.
3. Normalize by considering all possible candidate fields to get a proportional posterior.

#### Estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s high intelligence and skill in abstract thinking are strong fits, but his deep interest in nature and animals might not align perfectly.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Given the number of CS students in graduate schools, this is relatively high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s love for plants, animals, and empathy align exceptionally well.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Lower than CS, given fewer students in these specific fields.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): While business administration might be less likely given Adam's profile focused on empathy for animals and abstract thinking rather than business or management, it can't be ruled out completely.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Similar to or slightly less than CS.

### Simplified Probability Values (qualitative estimates):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Adam’s intelligence and abstract thought processes align well. However, his other interests such as empathy for animals and nature are slightly less aligned.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5)**: Strong alignment with Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. He fits this field quite well.
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Least likely compared to the other two fields, as Adam’s key personality traits focus more on nature, animals, and puzzles rather than business and administration.
