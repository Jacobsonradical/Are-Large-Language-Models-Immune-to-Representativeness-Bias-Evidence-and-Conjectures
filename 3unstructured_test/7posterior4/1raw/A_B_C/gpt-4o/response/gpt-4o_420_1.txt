To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the probability of observing personality sketch E given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field. Because we don't have specific data about these probabilities, we will make some reasoned guesses based on the personality sketch E and the nature of each field. 

Let's assume the following prior probabilities based on general enrollment proportions in graduate programs:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.1 \)

These are just assumed to provide tangible numbers for the sake of illustration.

Next, we need estimates for the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low, as Adam's curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and strong empathy seem less aligned with typical traits sought in business administration. Let's say \( 0.05 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate, since his intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align with typical traits of computer science students. Let's say \( 0.3 \).
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High, as his curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field. Letâ€™s say \( 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' rule, 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = \sum_i P(E|H_i) P(H_i) \]

So,
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.3 \times 0.3) + (0.7 \times 0.1)  \]
\[ P(E) = 0.01 + 0.09 + 0.07 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.17 \]

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

1. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.17} \approx 0.0588 \]

2. Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.3}{0.17} \approx 0.5294 \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{0.17} \approx 0.4118 \]

Based on these calculations, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.0588,
  "computer science": 0.5294,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4118
}
