To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have specific prior probabilities, we will make reasonable assumptions based on common sense and use qualitative reasoning for the likelihoods. 

The formula for Bayes' rule is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \), \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \), and \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \) are the prior probabilities. Hypothetically, we will assume them to all be equal at \( \frac{1}{3} \) because we have no specific information favoring one over the other.
- \( P(E|H) \) is judged qualitatively based on the suitability of Adam's personality traits to each field.
- \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields since we normalize the results.

Given Adamâ€™s personality traits, we can estimate the likelihoods:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science suits Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) should be relatively high.
- Business Administration does not align well with Adam's interests and personality traits, so \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) should be low.
- Computer Science aligns well with Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles, but less so with his love for nature and animals. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) should be moderate.

Estimations:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)

Since \( P(H) \) is assumed to be equal for each field:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Bayes' rule applied:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all three fields and normalization ensures the sum of posteriors equals 1 when considering only these three fields, we skip its exact computation.

Now, normalize these results:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Normalization factor} &= 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.7 + 0.1 + 0.5}{3} = \frac{1.3}{3} \\
P(E) &= \frac{1.3}{3}
\end{align*}
\]

Normalized results:
\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) &= \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1.3}{3}} = \frac{0.7}{1.3} \approx 0.54 \\
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) &= \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1.3}{3}} = \frac{0.1}{1.3} \approx 0.08 \\
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) &= \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1.3}{3}} = \frac{0.5}{1.3} \approx 0.38
\end{align*}
\]

Final result:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.54,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.38
}
