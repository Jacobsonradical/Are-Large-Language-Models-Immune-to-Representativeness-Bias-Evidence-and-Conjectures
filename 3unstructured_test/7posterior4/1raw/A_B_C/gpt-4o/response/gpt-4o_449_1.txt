To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam (\( E \)), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, the probability of the personality sketch.

Given the qualitative nature of the data and absence of specific numerical priors \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided to estimate the likelihoods.

### Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, his deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly consistent with someone in this field. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should be high.

2. **Business Administration**: The personality traits such as a quiet demeanor, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly correlate with typical traits associated with business administration like leadership, extroversion, and strategic thinking. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) should be low.

3. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles, there is a moderate to high likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Given these qualitative considerations, here are the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H|E) \ for \ trying \ agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science \]
- \( P(E|H) \ for \ trying \  agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science \) is high
- Assuming prior \( P(H) \ is \ moderate \)

\[ P(H|E) \ for \ trying \ business \ administration \]
- \( P(E|H) \ for \ trying \ business \ administration \) is low
- Assuming prior \( P(H) \ is \ low \)

\[ P(H|E) \ for \ trying \ computer \ science \]
- \( P(E|H) \ for \ trying \ computer \ science is \ moderate \ to \ high \)
- Assuming prior \( P(H) \ is \ medium \ to \ high \)

Given these assumptions, the qualitative estimates are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

By incorporating both the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field and plausible prior distributions, we aim to provide a reasonable posterior probability for each field.
