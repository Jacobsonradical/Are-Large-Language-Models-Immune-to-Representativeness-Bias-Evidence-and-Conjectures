To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we lack exact numerical values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and the general association of characteristics to the fields.

### Notional Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \):
     - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are aligned with computer science.
     - Quiet and enjoys puzzles, indicative of problem-solving traits in this field.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{cs}) \):
     - A notable fraction of graduate students are in computer science due to its popularity and demand.
   
   Overall, the likelihood is moderately high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ag}) \):
     - Genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals directly align with agricultural and veterinary science.
     - Warm heart and appreciation for hard work align well with fieldwork typically involved in this area.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{ag}) \):
     - This field has a smaller proportion of graduate students compared to computer science.

   Overall, the likelihood is very high.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \):
     - Strong intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can align with analytical aspects of business administration.
     - However, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are not strongly indicative of typical business administration interests.
     - Preference for solving puzzles might not be a strong indicator.
   - Prior probability \( P(H_{ba}) \):
     - Business administration is a common graduate pursuit, but characteristics are a weak match.

   Overall, the likelihood is lower compared to the other two.

### Notional Posterior Probability

Given these qualitative insights, let's provide notional posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a relative assessment where agricultural and veterinary science are strongest, followed by computer science, and lastly business administration. Given more specific data, these estimations could be refined quantitatively.
