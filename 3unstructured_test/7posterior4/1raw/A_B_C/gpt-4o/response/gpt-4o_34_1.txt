To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field, and the likelihood of observing the given personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each field.

Bayes' rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in field \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence (total probability of personality sketch \( E \)).

Since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, we need to make educated estimations based on the description. Also, for \( P(E) \), since we are comparing between different fields, it is constant and can be ignored for relative comparison purposes.

Assuming the likelihoods based on the personality sketch and the nature of each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Fairly high, as computer science is a common field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as curiosity about nature and solving puzzles can align with computational thinking, but not specifically mentioned.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probably lower compared to computer science but fairly significant.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, as a love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with this field.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Common field, so the prior could be moderate.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Lower, as business administration does not strongly connect with love for nature, plants, or animals.

Here are the rough probability estimations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative alignment between Adam's personality traits and the likely academic fields, kept within a range between 0 and 1 for each. The total does not add up to 1 because they represent relative likelihoods independently without normalization.
