To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam enrolling in each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field \( H \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on these probabilities, precise numerical values can't be computed accurately. Instead, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and intuitive likelihoods:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are traits that can fit well with this field. However, computer science may not align perfectly with his curiosity about nature and love for animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns very well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

3. **Business Administration**: This field typically involves less focus on nature and animals, leaning more towards organizational skills, leadership, and economics, which are not particularly emphasized in Adam's personality sketch.

Given these considerations, the Bayesian probabilities are approximated as follows:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values reflect a higher likelihood that Adam would be enrolled in a field closely related to his interests and personality traits, particularly in agricultural and veterinary science.
