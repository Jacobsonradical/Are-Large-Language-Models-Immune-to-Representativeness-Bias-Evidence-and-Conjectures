To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being in a particular field before considering the given evidence \( E \). In the absence of specific statistics, we might treat the prior probabilities as roughly equal or based on general prevalence of fields among graduate students. However, since exact data is not provided, let's proceed with the assumption that the prior odds are equal.

2. **Identify the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in field \( H \).

3. **Compute \( P(H|E) \)**: Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) = \sum_{k} P(E|H_k) \cdot P(H_k) \) is the normalization factor, summing over all possible hypotheses \( H_k \).

Given the information about Adam, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on how well the personality sketch matches each field.

### Estimations:
- **Business Administration**: The personality sketch doesn't particularly fit the typical profile of a business administration student, who might be expected to have more interest in leadership, finance, or corporate strategy rather than nature and empathy. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) might be lower.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals. This would have a high likelihood \( P(E|H) \).
- **Computer Science**: While computer science often involves solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, the nature-oriented aspects of the personality sketch don't align as well. This might have a moderate likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Using a qualitative approach with arbitrary scaled values for illustration, we might assign:
- \( P(E|Business Administration) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|Computer Science) = 0.2 \)

### Computation:
Let's assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity:
\[ P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Normalization factor \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = \left(0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}(0.1 + 0.7 + 0.2) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, compute each posterior \( P(H|E) \):

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.1 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.7 \]

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.2 \]

Hence, the results are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
