To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). For this qualitative approach, we'll make reasonable assumptions.

Firstly, let's state Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields and we're only interested in comparing the probabilities across these fields, it suffices to compute the numerator \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for each field and then normalize these values.

Here's a qualitative assessment for each field:

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
1. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - High curiosity about nature and plants
   - Strong empathy and love for animals
   - Understanding of hard work and dedication
   
   These traits strongly align with the requirements and characteristics of students in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is high.

2. **Prior** \( P(H) \):
   - This field might have moderate enrollment among graduate fields. Let's assume a moderate prior.
     
Given these assumptions, \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) is fairly high.

### Computer Science
1. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
   - Enjoys solving puzzles
   
   These traits align with this field, although the love for nature and animals is less relevant. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to high.

2. **Prior** \( P(H) \):
   - Computer Science has high enrollment. Let's assume a high prior.
     
Given these assumptions, \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) is moderate to high.

### Business Administration
1. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \):
   - Understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant
   - Empathy is valuable

   However, the strong emphasis on nature, plants, and animals is less relevant here. Let's assume \( P(E|H) \) is low to moderate.

2. **Prior** \( P(H) \):
   - High enrollment in Business Administration. Let's assume a high prior.
     
Given these assumptions, \( P(E|H) \times P(H) \) is moderate.

### Normalizing Values
Let's assign qualitative values to the numerators, normalize them to sum to 1, and then express them as probabilities.

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Let's assume a value of 8.
2. Computer Science: Let's assume a value of 6.
3. Business Administration: Let's assume a value of 4.

Normalize:
\[ \text{Sum} = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 \]

Probabilities:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{8}{18} \approx 0.44 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{6}{18} \approx 0.33 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{4}{18} \approx 0.22 \)

Thus, we have:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.44",
  "computer science": "0.33",
  "business administration": "0.22"
}
```
