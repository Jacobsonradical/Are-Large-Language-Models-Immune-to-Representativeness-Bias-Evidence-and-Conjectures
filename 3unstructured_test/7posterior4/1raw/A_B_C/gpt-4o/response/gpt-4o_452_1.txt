Bayes' rule is formulated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to estimate each component of this formula:

1. **\(P(E|H)\)**: Likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given a specific field of study.
2. **\(P(H)\)**: Prior probability of the field of study.
3. **\(P(E)\)**: Marginal probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

Given only the personality sketch of Adam (E) and no additional data for exact calculation, we'll have to rely on reasonable assumptions based on Adam's traits and the characteristics commonly associated with the different fields.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate to low, as AVS is not among the most commonly pursued graduate fields.
   - Considering these factors, we assume \(P(H|E)\) is relatively high.

2. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as puzzle-solving and understanding abstract concepts align with CS, but not his love for nature and animals.
   - \( P(H) \): High, as CS is a very popular graduate field.
   - Considering these factors, we assume \(P(H|E)\) is moderately high.

3. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as Adam’s traits don't strongly correlate with typical business administration skills (e.g., management focus, corporate interest).
   - \( P(H) \): High, as BA is one of the most pursued graduate fields.
   - Considering these factors, we assume \(P(H|E)\) is relatively low.

Now, let’s formulate our estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.30,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values reflect the higher posterior probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science given Adam's personality sketch, a reasonable but lower probability for Computer Science, and a low probability for Business Administration.
