To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior \( P(H) \), and the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \). Given that we don't have actual data, we will have to make some subjective estimations based on the personality sketch of Adam and the typical characteristics of students in each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Unlikely that a typical business administration student has a deep love for nature, animals, or solving puzzles. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(H_{business}) \): Let's assume 15% of graduate students are in business administration. So, \( P(H_{business}) = 0.15 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): A computer science student is likely to enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts but may not necessarily have a strong interest in nature and animals. Let's assign \( P(E|H_{cs}) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(H_{cs}) \): Assume that 20% of graduate students are in computer science. So, \( P(H_{cs}) = 0.20 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H_{ag_vet}) \): Extremely likely given the strong interest in nature, animals, and empathy. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{ag_vet}) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(H_{ag_vet}) \): Assume 10% of graduate students are in agricultural and veterinary science. So, \( P(H_{ag_vet}) = 0.10 \).

The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) is tricky to calculate directly without more information, but since we are interested in the relative probabilities, we can consider it as a normalizing constant.

Putting this together:
\[
P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H_{ag_vet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{ag_vet}) \cdot P(H_{ag_vet})}{P(E)}
\]

Now, our relative likelihoods will be:

\[
P(H_{business}|E) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.15 = 0.015
\]

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.20 = 0.10
\]

\[
P(H_{ag_vet}|E) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.10 = 0.09
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same in each case, we only consider relative magnitudes:

\[
P(H_{business}|E) \approx \frac{0.015}{0.015 + 0.10 + 0.09} = \frac{0.015}{0.205} \approx 0.073
\]

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.10}{0.205} \approx 0.488
\]

\[
P(H_{ag_vet}|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.205} \approx 0.439
\]

So, our posterior probabilities, normalized, would be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.073,
  "computer science": 0.488,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.439
}
```

These values are relatively close to each other, reflecting some influence of the chosen priors and our estimates for likelihoods.
