To calculate the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have direct information on the priors (\(P(H)\)) or the likelihood (\(P(E|H)\)) values. Given the general trends and the provided personality sketch, we can make reasonable qualitative assessments to estimate these probabilities.

First, let's define the fields in terms of how well they align with Adam's personality and background:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - High relevance due to his love for nature, plants, animals, and his empathy.
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)) is moderately high.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Lower relevance to his described interests and background.
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)) is low.
   
3. **Computer Science**:
   - High relevance to his intelligence, abstract thinking, and puzzle-solving skills.
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)) is moderately high.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can roughly estimate the probabilities. Note that these are subjective evaluations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are just educated guesses based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with typical activities and requirements in each field. In a real-world scenario, more precise probabilities would require detailed statistical data.
