To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we should ideally know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood of the evidence \( P(E|H) \). However, given the general nature of the information, we can make educated assumptions to estimate these probabilities.

Bayes' rule is formally given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence E.

Given the personality sketch and assuming certain likeliness based on traits, we can approximate the relative likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, based on the subject's love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Less common field, lower prior compared to more popular fields like business or computer science.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the personality sketch doesn't align strongly with typical business traits.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, given the popularity of the field.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, based on the subject's intelligence, abstract thinking, and problem-solving nature.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, as it is a popular field.

Using these qualitative assessments, we can rank and assign rough probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values are estimates based on the given description and general assumptions of field popularity. To refine these estimates, one would need more precise data on the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field.
