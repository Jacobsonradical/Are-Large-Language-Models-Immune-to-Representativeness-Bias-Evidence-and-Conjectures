To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probability \( P(H) \). However, we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, so we'll have to make educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch \( E \) and common knowledge about graduate fields.

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence probability.

### Hypotheses
- \( H_1 \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_2 \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_3 \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

### Personality Sketch Analysis
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He has a deep love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and appreciates hard work and dedication.

### Estimations
1. **Business Administration (H1)**
   - \( P(E|H1) \): Likely to be low because the personality sketch doesn't particularly align with business administration.
   - \( P(H1) \): Moderate, as many students do enroll in business administration.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H2)**
   - \( P(E|H2) \): High because his curiosity about nature, plants, love of animals, and empathy align well with this field.
   - \( P(H2) \): Lower compared to business administration, but not negligible.
   
3. **Computer Science (H3)**
   - \( P(E|H3) \): Moderate since he enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are valuable skills in computer science.
   - \( P(H3) \): High, since computer science is a popular field of study.

Given this qualitative assessment, we will convert these intuitions into conditional probabilities.

### Posterior Probabilities

{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "computer science": "0.30"
}

These values reflect the qualitative assessment made based on the personality sketch provided. The exact numerical values could vary with additional information or specific datasets, but this should give a reasonable estimate based on the given data.
