To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have explicit numeric values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll need to rely on a qualitative assessment to provide relative probabilities. 

Given Adam's personality sketch, we can infer the likelihood of each field being consistent with his description. 

Let's break it down qualitatively:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's interest in nature, solving puzzles, empathy, and love for animals does not strongly align with a typical business administration student.
   - Skills like abstract concept understanding could be applicable, but the main interests do not align well.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and animals, which is a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This field highly appreciates dedication and hard work, fitting well with Adamâ€™s traits.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with computer science requirements.
   - However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and nature curiosity do not directly align with computer science.

Taking these qualitative assessments into account:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These values are estimates based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality with each field. They reflect the relative probabilities, with agricultural and veterinary science being the most likely field for Adam, followed by computer science, and business administration being the least likely.
