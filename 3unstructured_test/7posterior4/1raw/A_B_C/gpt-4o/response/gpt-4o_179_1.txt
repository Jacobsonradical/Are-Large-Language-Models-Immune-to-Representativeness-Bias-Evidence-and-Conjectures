To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \) and the prior probability of each hypothesis. For this example, let's assume that the prior probabilities are roughly uniform across all fields of study, meaning we will primarily be using the degree to which each field aligns with Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Abstract Concepts**: High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts do align well with computer science.
   - **Solving Puzzles**: Enjoyment of puzzles is also a trait that fits well with the mindset of many computer scientists.
   - **Nature, Empathy, Animals**: However, deep love for animals, nature, and strong empathy might be less directly correlated with computer science.

   Based on these considerations, it is plausible but not a perfect fit.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Abstract Concepts and Intelligence**: These traits can be useful in business, particularly in areas like strategic planning or data analysis.
   - **Empathy**: Can be important for leadership roles and understanding stakeholders.
   - **Nature, Animals**: These aspects are less relevant for business administration.

   The fit is moderate but not high.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Love for Animals and Nature**: A very strong alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - **Understanding of Hard Work**: Likely very relevant in these fields which require dedication and hands-on work.
   - **Intelligence and Abstract Thinking**: Also beneficial, particularly in more complex agricultural studies or veterinary research.

   This field aligns very well with the given character traits.

Given these considerations:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```
These probabilities are qualitative estimates, but they reflect the relative alignment between Adam's personality and the fields of study.
