To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the prior probability \( P(H) \)** for each field.
2. **Identify the likelihood \( P(E|H) \)** for each field, based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with the field.
3. **Compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)** using Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) remains constant across all hypotheses, it can be considered as a normalizing factor. Therefore, we can write:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming we don't have specific values for the priors \( P(H) \), we'll consider a high-level qualitative assessment to estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood: Adam’s traits like high intelligence, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoying solving puzzles can be associated with Computer Science.
   - Approximate \( P(E|H) \): High (0.6 to 0.8).

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood: Adam’s genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with this field.
   - Approximate \( P(E|H) \): Very high (0.7 to 0.9).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood: While Adam's traits like understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence are relevant, other traits like love for nature, empathy, and animals are less aligned.
   - Approximate \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to low (0.2 to 0.4).

Given these estimates, let's assign specific values within these ranges:

{
  "computer science": 0.7,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.3
}

Note that these are rough estimates based on the provided personality sketch, and the true probabilities would require more precise data and prior information.
