To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis using Bayes' rule, we would typically need information on the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each of these fields (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis (\( P(E|H) \)). However, we'll make educated guesses based on how well the personality sketch aligns with typical traits and interests of students in those fields.

Let's outline some reasonable assumptions for the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Given Adam's interest in nature and absence of any direct references to business or management, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) seems low.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals fits well with this field, suggesting \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.
   
3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence aligns moderately with this field, so \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) can be considered moderate.

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity (\( P(H) \) is the same for all fields) and focusing on the likelihood, we can use qualitative reasoning to approximate posterior probabilities.

{
  "business administration": 0.05,  // Low likelihood due to mismatch with Adam's interests.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // High likelihood due to strong alignment with Adam's interests.
  "computer science": 0.25  // Moderate likelihood due to partial alignment with Adam's interests.
}

These values are not exact probabilities but educated estimates reflecting the qualitative alignments with Adam's described traits and interests.
