In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider a few components: the prior probability for each field of study \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \), which can be computed by summing up \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for all possible hypotheses \( H \). Without specific data for each of these probabilities, I will provide an intuitive assessment based on the given information.

Bayes' Rule is stated as: 
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break down the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- **Computer Science:** Adam is described as having high intelligence, good understanding of abstract concepts, and a love for puzzles, which all align well with the skills often associated with computer science. While the interest in nature and animals is not directly related, it doesn't contradict the field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) could be somewhere moderate to high.

- **Business Administration:** Adam's personality traits like empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence could fit business administration, but his interests in nature, plants, and animals don't directly correlate with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \) is likely lower.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field closely aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, making it a natural fit. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \) is likely very high.

Assuming approximately equal priors for all fields (since we lack specific data), let's estimate the likelihoods based on fitting traits to fields:

\[ 
P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.6 \\
P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.2 \\
P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \approx 0.9 
\]

Given these likelihoods and assuming equal prior probabilities:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \times \text{prior}_{\text{cs}}}{P(E)} \\
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times \text{prior}_{\text{ba}}}{P(E)} \\
P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) = \frac{0.9 \times \text{prior}_{\text{avs}}}{P(E)} 
\]

Let's assume equal priors for simplicity (\( \text{prior} \approx 1/3 \)) and \( P(E) \) just serves as a normalizing constant:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \propto 0.6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.2 \\
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \propto 0.2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.066 \\
P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \propto 0.9 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 
\]

Summing these approximate values:

\[
0.2 + 0.066 + 0.3 = 0.566 \\
\]

Normalizing to get posterior probabilities:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.566} \approx 0.353 \\
P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{0.066}{0.566} \approx 0.117 \\
P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.566} \approx 0.53 
\]

Returning these values:
```json
{
  "computer science": "0.353",
  "business administration": "0.117",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.53"
}
```

Note: These values are estimates and may vary with different prior probabilities or more accurate data.
