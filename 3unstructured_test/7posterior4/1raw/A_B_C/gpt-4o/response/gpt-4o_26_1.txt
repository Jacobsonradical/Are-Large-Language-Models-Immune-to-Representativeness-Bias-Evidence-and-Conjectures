To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since specific numerical values for these probabilities are not provided, we will make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch of Adam and the typical characteristics of students in each field. This approach involves estimating \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch in each of the fields, and our perceptions of the prior probabilities \( P(H) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals and strong empathy.
   Based on these traits, \( P(E|H) \) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science would be high.
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Though Adam is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, his traits don't align strongly with business administration, which often involves a focus on management and economics rather than nature and animals.
   \( P(E|H) \) for this field would be lower.
   
3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits well with the problem-solving and abstract thinking required in computer science.
   \( P(E|H) \) for this field would be moderate.

Considering these qualitative assessments and recognizing the higher relevance of Adam's personality traits to Agricultural and Veterinary Science and Computer Science compared to Business Administration, we can estimate the posterior probabilities.

Let's normalize \( P(H|E) \) to have a clear comparison, even though the total doesn't sum up to 1.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

In this estimation, we've assessed the highest value (0.7) for Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on Adam's traits, a lower value (0.2) for Computer Science, which also aligns with his problem-solving skills, and the lowest value (0.1) for Business Administration, reflecting the least alignment with his personality sketch.
