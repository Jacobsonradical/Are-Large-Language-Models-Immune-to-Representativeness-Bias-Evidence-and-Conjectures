Bayesian inference requires information beyond the personality sketch provided â€” specifically, the base rates (prior probabilities) of each field and how strongly each personality trait correlates with enrollment in those specific fields (likelihoods). Without specific base rate and correlation data, the values provided will be qualitative estimates based on general associations.

Given Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work, we can infer that "agricultural and veterinary science" is the most likely field. His high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts also align well with "computer science."

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence (sum of probabilities across all hypotheses).

Quantitative estimates are provided based on qualitative judgments:

1. **Business administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and intelligence could play a role here, the direct connection to his love for nature and animals is less evident. Hence, this is less probable.

2. **Computer science**: Adam's intelligence and problem-solving affinity align well; however, his specific traits related to nature and animals lower this likelihood compared to agricultural and veterinary sciences.

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's traits strongly align with this field, given his love for animals, nature, and empathy. Thus, it appears most likely.

Qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These are rough estimates and should be refined with actual data for a precise calculation.
