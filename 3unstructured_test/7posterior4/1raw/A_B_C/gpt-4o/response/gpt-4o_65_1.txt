Determining the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in different fields given his personality sketch involves applying Bayes' rule. The rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

Since exact priors and likelihoods aren't provided, I'll make reasonable estimates based on typical distributions and relevant factors in the given context.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) for business administration
- \( H_2 \) for agricultural and veterinary science
- \( H_3 \) for computer science

First, we'll estimate the prior probabilities of each field \( P(H_1), P(H_2), \) and \( P(H_3) \) commonly inferred for graduate students.
For simplicity, I'll assume:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.3 \) (business administration)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.2 \) (agricultural and veterinary science)
- \( P(H_3) = 0.4 \) (computer science)

Now, considering the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
- For business administration, the personality traits of curiosity about nature, warm heart, and empathy are less directly aligned with typical profiles. Estimate: \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.1 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits align well with strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature. Estimate: \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.5 \)
- For computer science, the intelligence and appreciation for solving puzzles align well with the field. However, aspects like nature and love for animals don't align as well. Estimate: \( P(E|H_3) \approx 0.25 \)

To compute \( P(E) \), we consider:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) + P(E|H_3)P(H_3) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.2) + (0.25 \cdot 0.4) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.1 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.23 \]

Now, the posterior probabilities:

For business administration:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.23} \approx 0.13 \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.2}{0.23} \approx 0.43 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.4}{0.23} \approx 0.43 \]

Thus, our estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.13,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.43,
  "computer science": 0.43
}
```

While agricultural and veterinary science and computer science both hold higher probabilities, the specific strong alignment of empathy and love for animals gives a slight edge to agricultural and veterinary science.
