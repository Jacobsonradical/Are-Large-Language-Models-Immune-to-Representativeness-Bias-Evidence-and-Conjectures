To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of him being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor, the total probability of observing the personality sketch.

While exact numerical values for these probabilities are not specified, we can qualitatively estimate these based on the provided information in his personality sketch.

Let's break down each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts fit well with computer science. However, there is no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming in his profile.
   - Estimated moderate likelihood.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits do not directly relate to themes typically associated with business administration like leadership, strategic management, or financial acumen. His interest seems more aligned with nature and animals.
   - Estimated low likelihood.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a stated "genuine curiosity about nature," a "deep love for animals," and "strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication." These fit closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Estimated high likelihood.

Given these qualitative estimations, here are the relative probabilities:

\[
{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
\]

These values are subjective estimations based on the given personality sketch. The exact numeric probabilities may vary depending on additional context or data.
