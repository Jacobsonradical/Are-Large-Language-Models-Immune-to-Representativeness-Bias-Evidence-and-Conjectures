To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the information about Adam, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

However, we do not have precise numerical values for these probabilities, so we will make reasonable estimates based on the provided information.

### Assumptions for Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \)):
- We assume uniform prior probabilities for simplicity, as specific prior admission probabilities for each field are unknown. So, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{N} \) where \( N \) is the number of fields we are evaluating. Assuming there are many fields, \( P(H) \approx \frac{1}{3} \).

### Assumptions for Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):
- **Business Administration**: Likelihood may be low given that it's not typically associated with a deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles.
- **Computer Science**: Likelihood may be moderate to high given the interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence with abstract concepts.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Likelihood may be very high given the strong affinity for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work.

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) as the likelihood for Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as the likelihood for Computer Science.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) as the likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

### Assigning Likelihood Values:
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8 \)

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:
Using the proportional relationship (since the total does not need to sum to 1):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{BA}|E) & \propto 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \propto 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \\
P(H_{AVS}|E) & \propto 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \\
\end{align*}
\]

Normalize these proportions:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{BA}|E) & \propto 0.1 \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \propto 0.4 \\
P(H_{AVS}|E) & \propto 0.8 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Summing the proportions:

\[
0.1 + 0.4 + 0.8 = 1.3
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{BA}|E) & = \frac{0.1}{1.3} \approx 0.077 \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & = \frac{0.4}{1.3} \approx 0.308 \\
P(H_{AVS}|E) & = \frac{0.8}{1.3} \approx 0.615 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Final Posterior Probabilities Output:
\[
{
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "computer science": 0.308,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615
}
