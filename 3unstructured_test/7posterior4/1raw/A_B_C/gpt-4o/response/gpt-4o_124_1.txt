To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E, we need to consider Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given that you haven't provided any prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) or the marginal likelihoods (\( P(E) \)), we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the fields and the personality sketch provided.

Let's make the following assumptions:
1. Adam’s traits of empathy, hard work, dedication, and love for animals strongly correlate with agricultural and veterinary science.
2. His preference for puzzles and high intelligence correlate with computer science.
3. There seems to be less direct correlation between his personality and business administration.

We will use these considerations to subjectively estimate \( P(E|H) \). Without specific priors, we will assume equal priors for simplicity; however, the variation in the likelihoods will substantially affect our posterior probabilities.

Based on this reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Adam's traits strongly align with this field, so \( P(E|H) \) will be high.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

2. **Business administration**:
   - Although many fields can utilize empathy and dedication, there’s less direct correlation here.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

3. **Computer science**:
   - His interest in puzzles and abstract concepts fits well with this field.
   - Let’s assume \( P(E|H) = 0.6 \).

We can normalize these to ensure they reflect relative probability distributions, but for simplicity, we'll treat them as straightforward:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.6
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihoods given the evidence; however, note that without complete data (priors and the exact distribution of students in each field), these values are approximations.
