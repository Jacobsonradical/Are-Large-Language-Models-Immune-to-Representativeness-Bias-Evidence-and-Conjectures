To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Given the nature of the problem, we shall focus on evaluating \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with each field of study. We shall use intuition and general knowledge to estimate these probabilities.

Let’s analyze each field in relation to Adam's personality sketch for \( P(E|H_i) \):

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's characteristics such as high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his deep love for nature and animals is less directly related to this field.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate to High.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work align strongly with this field.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and empathy can be useful in business, his deep love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles, as well as his generally quiet demeanor, seem less directly aligned with this field.
   - Estimate \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low to Moderate.

Next, assuming minimal specific prior knowledge on the proportions of graduate students in each field (\( P(H) \)) and that they are somewhat evenly distributed, the posterior distribution would primarily be driven by \( P(E|H) \):

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These values indicate correspondingly moderate, high, and lower likelihoods based on Adam's personality and interests. Note that these are estimated values and, in reality, you would use more precise statistical measures from relevant datasets.
