To provide the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, it's important to note that without the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we can only make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch (E) and common knowledge about these fields.

Let's assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) qualitatively:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Pros: High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are conducive.
   - Cons: Less direct alignment with curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - Hypothetical \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Pros: Strong alignment with curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy.
   - Cons: None significantly noted.
   - Hypothetical \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \): High.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Pros: Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication can be relevant.
   - Cons: Less direct alignment with nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - Hypothetical \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low.

Based on this qualitative assessment and assuming equal priors in absence of concrete data, the posterior probabilities may be approximated as follows:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = k \cdot P(E|H_{CS}) \text{ (k constant across fields given equal priors)} \]
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = k \cdot P(E|H_{AgVet}) \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = k \cdot P(E|H_{BA}) \]

Given the qualitative likelihoods:
\[ P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \]
\[ P(E|H_{AgVet}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \]

Normalizing within our consideration:

\{
  "computer science": "around 0.33",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "around 0.67",
  "business administration": "around 0.17"
\}

However, if we maintain the values without normalization (as you noted they donâ€™t need to sum to 1):
\{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.2
\}
