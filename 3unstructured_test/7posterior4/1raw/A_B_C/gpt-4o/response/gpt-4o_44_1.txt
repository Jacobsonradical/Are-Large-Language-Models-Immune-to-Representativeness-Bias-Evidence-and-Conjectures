To use Bayes' rule to compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of E given each hypothesis. Since these specific prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge about these fields and Adam's personality sketch.

**Assumptions:**
1. Priors: We'll assume equal priors for simplicity.
2. Likelihoods: We'll base these on how well Adam's personality sketch matches with typical traits of students in these fields.

**Priors:**
- P(Computer Science) = 1/3
- P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 1/3
- P(Business Administration) = 1/3

**Likelihoods:**
- P(E | Computer Science): Moderate likelihood as computer science students can be quiet, intelligent, and adept at solving puzzles.
- P(E | Agricultural and Veterinary Science): High likelihood as this field aligns strongly with his interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with a warm heart and empathy.
- P(E | Business Administration): Low likelihood as personality traits such as a deep love for animals and nature might not be as relevant.

Using these assumptions:
- P(E | Computer Science) ≈ 0.5
- P(E | Agricultural and Veterinary Science) ≈ 0.8
- P(E | Business Administration) ≈ 0.2

**Bayes' Rule:**
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we are calculating relative likelihoods and using equal priors (1/3), we can ignore the denominator \( P(E) \) as it will be the same across all calculations.

**Calculations:**
- P(Computer Science): \( \frac{0.5 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.166 \)
- P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science): \( \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.266 \)
- P(Business Administration): \( \frac{0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}}{P(E)} \approx 0.066 \)

Normalizing these to sum up to 1 for interpretability:

\[ P(Computer Science | E) = \frac{0.166}{0.166 + 0.266 + 0.066} \approx 0.28 \]
\[ P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science | E) = \frac{0.266}{0.166 + 0.266 + 0.066} \approx 0.45 \]
\[ P(Business Administration | E) = \frac{0.066}{0.166 + 0.266 + 0.066} \approx 0.11 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities for each field based on Adam's personality sketch are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.28,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.11
}
