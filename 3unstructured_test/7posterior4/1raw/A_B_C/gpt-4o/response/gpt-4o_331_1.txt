To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand the basic formulation of Bayes' Theorem which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses and let's focus on the relative likelihoods. We'll make reasonable assumptions based on typical personality traits and inclinations associated with each field.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, loves animals, and has a warm heart.
   - These traits are less typical for someone in business administration (relative to the other fields mentioned).
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) might be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are very pertinent to computer science.
   - He is of high intelligence.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) could be higher than business administration but lower compared to agricultural and veterinary science, considering his love for nature and animals is not directly aligned.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and appreciates hard work.
   - These traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary sciences.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet}}) \) should be high due to direct relevance.

Let's assign some rough probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) = 0.1
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) = 0.3
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet}}) \) = 0.7

Given the above likelihoods, we normalize them to ensure they are on a consistent scale. Since we do not have explicit priors (\( P(H) \)), weâ€™ll consider them roughly uniform. The conditional probabilities are then:

\[
P(H_{\text{business}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.1+0.3+0.7} = \frac{0.1}{1.1} \approx 0.09
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.3}{0.1+0.3+0.7} = \frac{0.3}{1.1} \approx 0.27
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.7}{0.1+0.3+0.7} = \frac{0.7}{1.1} \approx 0.64
\]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.09,
  "computer science": 0.27,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.64
}
```
