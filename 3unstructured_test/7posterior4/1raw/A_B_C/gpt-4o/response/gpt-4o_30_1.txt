To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can't compute exact numerical values. Instead, we can make qualitative estimations based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and love for solving puzzles fit well with computer science, as these attributes are valuable in this field. However, his deep love for animals and nature might not be as relevant.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field of study in graduate programs, so \( P(H) \) is relatively high.
   - Estimate: Moderate due to mixed alignment with the personality sketch.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits don't strongly align with typical business administration qualities. While empathy and communication can be important, his specific interests in nature and animals are less relevant.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common field, so \( P(H) \) is relatively high.
   - Estimate: Low due to weak alignment with the personality sketch.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for animals, empathy, curiosity about nature and plants, and understanding of hard work highly align with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This field is less common compared to computer science and business administration, so \( P(H) \) might be lower.
   - Estimate: High due to strong alignment with the personality sketch.

Given these qualitative assessments, the estimated conditional probabilities might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are illustrative and based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the fields in question, along with general considerations of the prevalence of each field in graduate studies.
