To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we express it as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

For a full and accurate computation, specific prior probabilities and likelihoods need to be known. Since we don't have these exact values, we will make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge.

To proceed, let's assume:
- \( P(H) \) for each field is the probability that a graduate student is enrolled in that field generally.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given the field of study.

Here's a rough estimation based on these assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, since Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate, since agriculture and veterinary sciences have a decent proportion of students.
   - \( P(E) \): Moderately high, given that Adam's traits are quite aligned with agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, he enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which aligns with computer science, but there is less direct alignment with his love for nature and animals.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, as computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - \( P(E) \): Moderate, fitting some of his traits like puzzle-solving but not others like his empathy and love for nature.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, there's a less direct fit between his personality and the typical traits needed for business administration.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, as business administration is a highly popular field.
   - \( P(E) \): Low, since business administration traits typically include extroversion and strategic thinking, which are not highlighted in Adam's profile.

Given these considerations, let's assign some rough probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimation reflects the alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field based on the given information.
