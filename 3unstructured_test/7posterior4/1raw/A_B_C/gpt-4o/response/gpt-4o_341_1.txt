To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field (business administration, computer science, and agricultural and veterinary science), we need to follow Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a certain field.
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \): Marginal likelihood of the evidence (which is a normalizing factor, so we can ignore it when evaluating relative probabilities among different hypotheses).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to assess \( P(E|H) \) for each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - Strong empathy and deep love for animals.
   - Enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence.
   - These traits are less typical of a business administration student.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science.
   - High intelligence is also associated with computer science.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - These traits are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.

### Hypothetical Likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Lower probability, let's assign 0.1.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Moderate probability, let's assign 0.4.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High probability, let's assign 0.7.

### Prior Probabilities:
For simplicity, let's assume the prior probabilities are equal among the three fields (i.e., \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \)):

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{1}{3} \).

### Posterior Probabilities:
Since prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) are equal, the posterior probabilities are directly proportional to the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)).

### Final Results:
Here are the computed probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.4 + 0.7} \approx 0.083 \),
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.4}{0.1 + 0.4 + 0.7} \approx 0.333 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.7}{0.1 + 0.4 + 0.7} \approx 0.583 \)
}

{
  "business administration": "0.083",
  "computer science": "0.333",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.583"
}
