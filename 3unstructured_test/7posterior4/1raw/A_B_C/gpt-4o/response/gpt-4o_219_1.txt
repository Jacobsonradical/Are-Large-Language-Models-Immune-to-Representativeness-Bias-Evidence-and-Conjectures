To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - These are the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field before observing his personality.

2. **Calculate the Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - This is the probability of observing Adam's personality given that he is enrolled in each field.

3. **Use Bayes' Rule**:
   - Bayes' rule states: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)

Since \( P(E) \) (the evidence) is a normalizing constant and can be complex to compute without more data, and given we are interested in ranking the probabilities rather than their absolute values, we focus on the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

- **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
  - Assume each field has an equal prior probability of 1/3.

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - Based on personality elements:
    - "Curiosity about nature and plants" aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
    - "Solving puzzles" and "understanding abstract concepts" align well with computer science.
    - Business administration doesn't strongly align with the given personality traits.
    - "Deep love for animals" aligns with agricultural and veterinary science.

### Calculation

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - High alignment: \( P(E|H) \) is high.
  
- For **Business Administration**:
  - Low alignment: \( P(E|H) \) is low.

- For **Computer Science**:
  - Moderate to high alignment: \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to high.

### Simplified Values for Likelihoods (Assumed for Demonstration)
- \( P(E | \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E | \text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E | \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.7 \)

### Posterior Calculation (Proportional Values)
- Using an equal prior of 1/3 for simplicity:
  - \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \)

Thus:
- \( P(H | \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \propto 0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H | \text{Business Administration}) \propto 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.033 \)
- \( P(H | \text{Computer Science}) \propto 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.233 \)

These values are proportional to the actual posterior probabilities. Considering they sum to less than 1 due to the other possible fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.233
}
```

Note: These probabilities can be normalized if we consider other fields, but as per the instruction, they do not need to sum up to 1.
