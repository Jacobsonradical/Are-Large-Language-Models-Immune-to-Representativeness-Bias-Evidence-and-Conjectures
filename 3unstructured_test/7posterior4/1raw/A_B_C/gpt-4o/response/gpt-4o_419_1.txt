To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis (field of study) given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' Rule.

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

For simplicity, we will make some reasonable assumptions about these probabilities but acknowledge that they are estimates.

1. **Business Administration**: This field is typically associated with individuals who are interested in management, economics, and leadership skills. Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with this field. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, empathy, and love for animals align strongly with this field.

3. **Computer Science**: His interest in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts could align with this field, but it is not as strong a match as agricultural and veterinary science.

Now let's estimate the probabilities:

- **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**: Let's assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity, although in reality they may differ. 
  - \( P(\text{business administration}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3} \)
  - \( P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{1}{3} \)

- **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on the alignment of Adam's personality sketch:
  - \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.8 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)

- **Normalizing constant \( P(E) \)** (to ensure the probabilities sum to 1 across all hypotheses, though you mentioned it's not needed for this question, we include it for completeness):

\[ P(E) = P(E| \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) + P(E| \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.1 + 0.8 + 0.3}{3} = \frac{1.2}{3} = 0.4 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Rule to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \approx 0.083 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \approx 0.667 \]

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \approx 0.25 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.083,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
