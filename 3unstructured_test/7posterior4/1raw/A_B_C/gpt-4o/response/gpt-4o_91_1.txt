To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider a few components:
1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Adam is in the specific field \( H \).
3. The marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of observing the evidence across all considered fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field are equally likely since we do not have specific information about them. Therefore, \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \). 

Next, we qualitatively assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch provided:
- For Computer Science: Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts fit well, but his love for nature and animals may be less relevant here.
- For Business Administration: While Adam's intelligence applies, the described traits (love for nature, animals, puzzles) seem less typical for this field.
- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, animals, and his empathy strongly align with this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{AgVet}) \approx 0.8 \)

Remember, these are subjective probabilities. Now we normalize these probabilities to ensure \( P(E) \) sums to 1 for simplicity:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.4}{3} + \frac{0.2}{3} + \frac{0.8}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{1.4}{3} \approx 0.467 \]

Now we compute the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.286 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.143 \]
\[ P(H_{AgVet}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AgVet}) \cdot P(H_{AgVet})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.571 \]

Given these calculations, the approximate posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.286,
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571
}
