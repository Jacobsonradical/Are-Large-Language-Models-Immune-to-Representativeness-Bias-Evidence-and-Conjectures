To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several components:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) of each field, which represents the general proportion of graduate students enrolled in each field. This is often based on overall enrollment statistics.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is how probable the evidence (personality sketch E) is given a specific field H. This reflects how well Adam's personality and interests align with the typical characteristics of students in each field.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact data for prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the overall evidence \( P(E) \), we'll make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge.

**Assumptions:**
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) is based on general enrollment distribution data (which we assume from external statistics).
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is assessed based on how well Adam's personality aligns with typical students in each field.

### Hypothesis 1: Computer Science
- Generally, computer science attracts individuals who are good at solving puzzles and abstract thinking, which fits Adam's profile.
- However, it may not directly align with his strong empathy, love for animals, and deep curiosity about nature and plants.

### Hypothesis 2: Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- This field aligns very well with Adam's interests in nature, plants, animals, and strong empathy.
- His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also fit well in this field.

### Hypothesis 3: Business Administration
- Business administration may attract intelligent individuals but typically does not align strongly with Adam's deep love for nature, animals, and a strong sense of empathy.
- Therefore, the likelihood is lower compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given these considerations, I'll provide estimated probabilities for each based on qualitative matching.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These numbers reflect the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, normalized to give an approximate understanding based on Adam's personality sketch. They do not sum to 1, as requested, indicating that there are other possible fields Adam could be enrolled in.
