To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

This rule requires knowing or estimating:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) prior to observing the evidence \( E \).
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

However, given that we don't have specific data for these pieces, we'll have to qualitatively reason about them based on the information provided.

**Attributes of Adam's personality sketch (E):**

- Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart and strong empathy
- Deep love for animals
- High intelligence
- Good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication
  
Let's analyze \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and plants is not highly associated with business administration.
   - Love for animals and strong empathy are less relevant.
   - Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant but are not unique to this field.
   - Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication are important, but apply broadly.

   So, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Enjoys solving puzzles is highly relevant.
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are also highly relevant.
   - Curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant.
   - Empathy is not specifically relevant to computer science.

   So, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to high.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants is highly relevant.
   - Deep love for animals is highly relevant.
   - Warm heart and strong empathy are relevant for veterinary but less so for agricultural science.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
   - Intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant, especially in research-oriented roles within these fields.

   So, \( P(E|H) \) is high.

Based on qualitative reasoning about the priors \( P(H) \) and the overall probability \( P(E) \), which are harder to quantify exactly without more specific data, we might reason as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are illustrative and reasoned based on the given evidence and typical characteristics associated with each field.
