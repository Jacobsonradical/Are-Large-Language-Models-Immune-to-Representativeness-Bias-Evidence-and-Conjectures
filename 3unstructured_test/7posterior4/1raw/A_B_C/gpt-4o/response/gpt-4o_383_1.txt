To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we should consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to get meaningful results, we would ideally need more detailed statistical data about the prevalence of various fields of graduate study and how well the personality traits in \( E \) are represented in each field. Since such exact data isn't provided, we can make educated estimations based on the given personality sketch.

Let's break down the analysis for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Likely lower compared to the other fields due to fewer students typically enrolling in this field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, due to Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and his empathy.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Higher compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but less than Computer Science.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Lower, as Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with common traits seen in Business Administration students (e.g., strategic thinking, communication skills).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: High given the popularity of the field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate to high, because while Adam's skills in solving puzzles and high intelligence align with the field, his empathy and love for animals are less typical.

Estimations for posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on interpretative judgement rather than exact probabilities, reflecting Adam's personality alignment more closely with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least with Business Administration.
