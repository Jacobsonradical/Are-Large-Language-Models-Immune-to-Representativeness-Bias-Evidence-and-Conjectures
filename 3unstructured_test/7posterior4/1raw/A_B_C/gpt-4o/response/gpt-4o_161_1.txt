To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values, we'll assume the following qualitative judgments for these probabilities.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, the probability that Adam exhibits these traits if he is enrolled in a business administration program might be moderate. Business administration typically involves management, finance, and leadership, which might not closely align with Adam's traits such as love for nature, animals, and empathy, but may involve problem-solving skills.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability can be considered moderate, as business administration is a common graduate field.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is high. This field closely aligns with his curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability might be lower relative to business administration and computer science, as fewer people typically pursue this specialization compared to more generalized fields.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Given the personality sketch, the likelihood that Adam exhibits these traits if he is enrolled in computer science might be moderate to high. Computer science often involves solving complex problems, which aligns with Adamâ€™s intelligence and puzzle-solving skills. However, it doesn't align as closely with his love for nature and animals.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability is high, as computer science is a popular and highly enrolled graduate field.

Based on these assessments, let's provide qualitative posterior probabilities:

{
  "business administration": \( 0.1 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( 0.6 \),
  "computer science": \( 0.3 \)
}

These values are qualitative judgments based on the alignment between the personality sketch and typical traits expected in those fields. They should be taken as rough estimates rather than precise computations.
