To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given the personality sketch of Adam using Bayes' rule, additional information such as the prior probabilities of each field (P(H)) and the likelihood of the personality sketch given each field (P(E|H)) would be required. However, since this information isn't provided, we'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the given description of Adam and the nature of each field.

Bayes' Rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence E.

We need to assign plausible values to the priors and likelihoods. For simplicity, let's make some qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)): High, as Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
   - Prior (P(H)): Moderate, assuming various possible fields in graduate studies.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)): Low, as Adam’s traits do not strongly align with typical interests in business administration.
   - Prior (P(H)): Moderate to Low, as business administration might be less common among students with Adam's interests.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood (P(E|H)): Moderate, given his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, but less alignment with his love for nature and animals.
   - Prior (P(H)): Moderate to High due to the popularity of the field.

Without detailed numerical data, we provide approximate probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These qualitative posterior probabilities reflect the alignment of the personality sketch with the nature of each field, assuming equal priors for a broader range of possible graduate fields. Adjustments could be made with more precise prior probabilities and likelihoods.
