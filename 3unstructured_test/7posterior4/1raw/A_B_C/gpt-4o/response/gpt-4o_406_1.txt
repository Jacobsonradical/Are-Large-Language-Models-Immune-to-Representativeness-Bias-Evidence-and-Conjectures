To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While I can't provide exact numerical values for these probabilities without specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch (E) and typical characteristics of students in the different fields.

We're given the personality sketch of Adam which includes his interests and traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart and strong empathy.
4. Deep love for animals.
5. High intelligence.
6. Good at understanding abstract concepts.
7. Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these traits, let's assess each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Typical traits might include leadership, strategic thinking, interest in business operations, and finance. While Adam’s traits show he is intelligent and appreciates hard work, there are no strong indications that he has an interest in business-related topics. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is likely to be lower.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - This field might attract those who enjoy solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. Adam fits well into this description on those counts. However, his love for nature and animals doesn't strongly align with typical computer science themes. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is moderately aligned.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field is directly related to nature, plants, and animals. Adam’s strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals directly align with this field. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is highly aligned.

Based on this qualitative assessment, the conditional probabilities might be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1 (low probability given the lack of match with personality traits),
  "computer science": 0.4 (moderate probability given some alignment),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 (high probability given strong alignment)
}

Again, these values are qualitative and based on assessing the alignment of traits with typical requirements or characteristics of the given fields. Accurate computation would require specific data.
