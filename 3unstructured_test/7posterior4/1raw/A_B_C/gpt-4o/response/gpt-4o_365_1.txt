To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we will use Bayes' Rule, stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given field given the personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch given that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the personality sketch across all fields.

Since we lack specific statistical data for the priors and likelihoods, we will make qualitative estimates for the purpose of this exercise.

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, there is a moderate likelihood he could be enrolled in Computer Science.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Considering Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, there's a high likelihood he could be enrolled in this field.

3. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's empathy, high intelligence, and understanding of hard work, there is some likelihood, but it's lower compared to the other fields due to less direct connection with his interests.

Let's assume an arbitrary but reasonable assignment for qualitative priors and likelihoods:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(H_{AV}) = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.15 \)
  - Others (0.3), but not required for conditional probability calculation

- Likelihoods:
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{AV}) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.4 \)

The evidence \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + \ldots \]
\[ P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.3) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.175 + 0.06 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.385 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

- For Computer Science:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{0.385} = \frac{0.15}{0.385} \approx 0.39 \]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_{AV}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.385} = \frac{0.175}{0.385} \approx 0.45 \]

- For Business Administration:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.15}{0.385} = \frac{0.06}{0.385} \approx 0.16 \]

Thus we get the following probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.39,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "business administration": 0.16
}
```

Please note that these probabilities are approximations based on the qualitative assumptions made for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
