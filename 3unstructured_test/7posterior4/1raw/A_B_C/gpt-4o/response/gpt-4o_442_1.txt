To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the personality sketch given that the subject is in a particular field. 

Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H_i|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H_i\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H_i)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H_i\).
- \(P(H_i)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H_i\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence \(E\).

Since we do not have actual values for each field's prior \( P(H) \) and likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we will use a qualitative approach to estimate these values based on the personality sketch.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Assess Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):**
   - Generally, assume these are somewhat equal because we don't have specific data.
   
2. **Evaluate Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
     - High: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy align well with this field.
   - **Business Administration:**
     - Low to Moderate: Traits like empathy and intelligence are broadly useful, but other fields could align better.
   - **Computer Science:**
     - Moderate: High intelligence and problem-solving skills match well, but not as closely aligned with the specific interests in nature and animals.

3. **Estimate \( P(E) \):**
   - Since \( P(E) \) remains constant across all hypotheses it can be treated as a normalizing factor and adjusted out in comparative scenarios.
  
Let's assign qualitative probabilities to reflect presence and absence of matching conditions:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agriculture and veterinary}}) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business admin}}) \approx 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.5 \]

Assuming equal prior for simplicity \( P(H_{\text{agriculture and veterinary}}) = P(H_{\text{business admin}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 1/3 \):

\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture and veterinary}}|E) \propto 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) \propto 0.3 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.5 \]

### Standardizing and Normalizing (for perspective):

\[ \text{Total} = 0.7 + 0.3 + 0.5 = 1.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agriculture and veterinary}}|E) \approx \frac{0.7}{1.5} = 0.47 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business admin}}|E) \approx \frac{0.3}{1.5} = 0.20 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx \frac{0.5}{1.5} = 0.33 \]

So the approximate posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.20,
  "computer science": 0.33
}
```

These values provide a rough estimate based on the given qualitative data. Ideally, with actual data on prior distributions and more detailed likelihood information, these numbers could be further refined.
