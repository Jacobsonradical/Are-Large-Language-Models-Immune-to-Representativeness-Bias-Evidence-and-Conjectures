To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods to calculate this properly. Since we don't have exact values, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam and general trends. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) as the probability that Adam's personality sketch would be observed if he were in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) as the probability that Adam's personality sketch would be observed if he were in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) as the probability that Adam's personality sketch would be observed if he were in business administration.

Assume:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): the general prior probability of being a graduate student in computer science.
- \( P(H_{AVS}) \): the general prior probability of being a graduate student in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{BA}) \): the general prior probability of being a graduate student in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Without exact numbers, we will rely on reasonable judgment based on Adam's interests and common trends.

Let’s make the following qualitative assessments:
1. Computer science students may be good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, but they are not particularly known for having a strong connection to nature and animals. Therefore, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) might be moderate to low.
2. Agricultural and veterinary science students are likely to have a curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. This makes \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) quite high.
3. Business administration students might have a broad range of characteristics, but Adam’s empathy, love for nature, and animals don't strongly align with a typical business administration profile. Thus, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) might be low.

For simplicity, assume equal priors for each field: \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{AVS}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{3} \).

Given these qualitative assessments:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Let’s assume 0.2 (moderate).
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Let’s assume 0.7 (high).
- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Let’s assume 0.1 (low).

Now, ignoring \( P(E) \) as it’s the same for comparison purposes, we can approximate the relative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": \( 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.067 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.233 \),
  "business administration": \( 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.033 \)
}

Normalized (these might not sum to 1 exactly nor do they need to be normalized here):

{
  "computer science": 0.067,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233,
  "business administration": 0.033
}
