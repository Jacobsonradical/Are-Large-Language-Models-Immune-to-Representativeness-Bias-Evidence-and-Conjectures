To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch (E) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of E.

Since exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and marginal likelihood \( P(E) \) are not provided, we'll make qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's interests and traits, we can reasonably estimate the following likelihoods:

1. Business Administration:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the personality traits and interests do not strongly align with typical expectations for a focus in business administration.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Moderate, as Business Administration is a common field among graduate students.

2. Computer Science:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as problem-solving and high intelligence are relevant here, though the deep love for nature and animals is less directly related.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): High, as Computer Science is a very popular graduate field.

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, as the warm heart, high empathy, love for animals, appreciation for hard work, and interest in plants align well.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Low to Moderate, depending on the relative size of this field among graduate students.

Making these qualitative assumptions, we can approximate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{\text{Low likelihood} \times \text{Moderate prior}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{\text{Moderate likelihood} \times \text{High prior}}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{\text{High likelihood} \times \text{Low to Moderate prior}}{P(E)} \]

Therefore, qualitatively estimating:

- \( P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.6 \)

This results in the following estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
