To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), it's challenging to provide precise numerical values. Instead, I will provide qualitative estimations based on the given information about Adam's interests and characteristics.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's strong intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be relevant in this field.
   - However, his specific curiosity about nature, plants, and animals is less aligned with a primary focus on computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adamâ€™s empathy and understanding of hard work are relevant in business contexts.
   - His distinct interests in nature and animals suggest that business administration might not be his field of choice.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy, which are highly relevant to this field.
   - His appreciation for dedication aligns well with the demanding nature of agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the qualitative posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are rough estimations based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits and interests with the fields in question. For more precise calculations, specific data on priors and likelihoods would be necessary.
