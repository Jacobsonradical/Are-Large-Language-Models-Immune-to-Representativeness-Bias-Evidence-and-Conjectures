To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H) \) of being enrolled in each field, and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of having Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in each field. Unfortunately, exact values for these probabilities are not provided, so we can only qualitatively assess the likelihoods and priors based on general knowledge and make plausible assumptions to estimate the posteriors.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions here:

**Prior Probabilities** (based on common distributions of graduate fields):
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) = Assume that computer science is popular; let's say 0.25.
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \) = Business administration is also quite popular; let’s say 0.20.
- \( P(H_{\text{AVS}}) \) = Agricultural and veterinary science is less common; let’s say 0.05.

**Likelihoods** (based on how Adam's personality matches the fields):
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Adam is intelligent and likes solving puzzles, which are good traits for computer science; let’s say 0.2.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Adam’s personality doesn't strongly fit business administration; let’s say 0.05.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \): His love for animals and nature fits agricultural and veterinary science very well; let’s say 0.7.

The denominator \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) can be simplified as a normalization factor, which we’ll handle by not calculating directly and instead normalizing the results post hoc.

Computing unnormalized posteriors for each field:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.05 \cdot 0.20 = 0.01 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.05 = 0.035 \]

Finally, we normalize these posteriors so that they sum to 1 (for better interpretation, even though total under requested fields needn't sum to 1):

Total for normalization = \( 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.035 = 0.095 \)

Normalized posteriors:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.095} \approx 0.526 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.01}{0.095} \approx 0.105 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.035}{0.095} \approx 0.368 \]

Thus, we have:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.526,
  "business administration": 0.105,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.368
}
