To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we need to use Bayes' rule, expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity and clarity, we'll make some assumptions about the prior probabilities, \( P(H) \), and the likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \). The exact values for these probabilities are usually determined by empirical data, which we do not have. Instead, we will use qualitative reasoning based on the given personality sketch to estimate these probabilities.

### Assumptions:

- **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
  - Assume equal prior probabilities for simplicity: \(\frac{1}{N}\), where \(N\) is the number of fields we're considering.
  - In this case, \( N = 3 \), so \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{1}{3} \).

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.
  - **Computer science**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts make this field plausible, but it does not directly connect with his love for nature and animals. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.
  - **Business administration**: While Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, this field does not align closely with the provided personality traits related to empathy for animals and nature. Thus, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is lower.

Combining our assumptions:

### Likelihood Estimates:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)

### Prior \( P(E) \):
- Since \( P(E) \) is the sum of the likelihoods weighted by the priors, we can compute:
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.8 + 0.6 + 0.3}{3} = \frac{1.7}{3} \approx 0.567 \]

### Calculating Posterior Probabilities:
- For each field:
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.567} \approx \frac{0.267}{0.567} \approx 0.471 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.567} \approx \frac{0.2}{0.567} \approx 0.353 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.567} \approx \frac{0.1}{0.567} \approx 0.176 \]

Given the approximations used, here are the posterior probabilities:
