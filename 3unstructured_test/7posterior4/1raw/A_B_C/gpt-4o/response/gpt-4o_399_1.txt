To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to be mindful of how Bayes' rule works. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that \( P(E) \) would be constant for all hypotheses in this specific scenario, we'll primarily focus on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior \( P(H) \).

1. **Business Administration**: Given the personality traits described:
   - High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts might be relevant.
   - However, the deep love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy are less directly relevant.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{business administration}) \) seems relatively low.
   
   Estimate: \( P(H_{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Strong curiosity about nature and plants aligns perfectly.
   - Deep love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are highly relevant.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{agricultural/veterinary science}) \) seems quite high.
   
   Estimate: \( P(H_{agricultural/veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and solving puzzles match well.
   - Understanding abstract concepts also aligns.
   - However, curiosity about nature, plants, and animals is less directly relevant.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \) is moderate.
   
   Estimate: \( P(H_{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)

We use these qualitative assessments to provide approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are estimates based on qualitative descriptions and may not correspond to exact probability calculations. In a genuine statistical scenario, exact priors \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) would be derived from empirical data.
