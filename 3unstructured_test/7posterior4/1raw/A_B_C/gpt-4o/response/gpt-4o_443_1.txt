To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which describes how likely the personality traits are given the specific field of study. Since these priors are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions and the given information.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the denominator \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields and just serves as a normalization constant, we can consider the relative values of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each hypothesis H.

### Assumptions:
1. Prior probabilities \( P(H) \):
   - \( P(\text{business administration}) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \)

2. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
   - For business administration, Adam's personality is less aligned with typical traits (low curiosity about nature, typically more focused on human interactions and business aspects).
   - For agricultural and veterinary science, Adam's traits are highly aligned (curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work).
   - For computer science, Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles are well-aligned (good at understanding abstract concepts).

### Likelihood Estimates:
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.5 \)

### Posterior Computation:
Using these estimates, we compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities:
- For business administration: \( 0.1 \cdot 0.3 = 0.03 \)
- For agricultural and veterinary science: \( 0.7 \cdot 0.2 = 0.14 \)
- For computer science: \( 0.5 \cdot 0.3 = 0.15 \)

### Normalization (Optional for relative comparison):
\[ P(E) \approx 0.03 + 0.14 + 0.15 = 0.32 \]

Normalized posteriors:
- \( P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx \frac{0.03}{0.32} \approx 0.094 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx \frac{0.14}{0.32} \approx 0.438 \)
- \( P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx \frac{0.15}{0.32} \approx 0.469 \)

But for the sake of relative comparison without strict normalization, we consider the unnormalized values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.03,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.14,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```
These values indicate the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each respective field based on his personality sketch.
