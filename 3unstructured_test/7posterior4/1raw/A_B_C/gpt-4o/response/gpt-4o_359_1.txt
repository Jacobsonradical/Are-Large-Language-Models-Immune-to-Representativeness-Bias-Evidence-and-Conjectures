To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll start by using the following formula for Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

However, without specific numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \) for each field, we can only offer qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam and typical characteristics of students in each field. Therefore, the following values are based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculations.

Given that:

1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. He has a strong empathy and love for animals.
3. He enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
4. He has a high level of intelligence.
5. He appreciates hard work and dedication.

We can infer the following qualitative likelihoods:

- **Business Administration**: This field is typically not directly related to nature, plants, or animals. However, it may attract intelligent individuals who appreciate hard work and dedication. Thus, the likelihood is relatively low.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy for animals, and likely a caring nature. Thus, the likelihood is relatively high.
- **Computer Science**: This field correlates with Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. However, it does not directly cater to his love for nature and animals. Thus, the likelihood is moderate.

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities could be approximated as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values indicate that, based on the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to have been enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and is least likely to have been enrolled in business administration.
