To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field of study, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability of the hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the evidence \(E\).

Given that the priors (\(P(H)\)) for each field are not explicitly provided, and assuming the evidence (\(E\)) provided is equally probable across the entire population of graduate students, let's rely on qualitative analysis for \(P(E|H)\).

We assess \(P(E|H)\) for each field based on how well Adam's personality traits fit with students commonly enrolled in those fields:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Curiosity about abstract concepts and high intelligence are strong fits.
   - Empathy, nature, and animals are less typically associated.
   - Probability \(P(E|H)\): Medium.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - Empathy, understanding, and dedication fit.
   - Not specific to curiosity about nature or animals.
   - Probability \(P(E|H)\): Low.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Strong fit for love of nature, plants, and animals.
   - Empathy and warm-heartedness align well.
   - High intelligence and dedication also fit.
   - Probability \(P(E|H)\): High.

Based on qualitative analysis and assuming priors are roughly even:

\[ P(E|H): \text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science} > \text{Computer Science} > \text{Business Administration} \]

Let's assign qualitative probabilities (these are rough estimates due to lack of concrete priors):

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's described traits with common traits found in students of these fields. For precise numerical probabilities, detailed datasets and priors would be necessary.
