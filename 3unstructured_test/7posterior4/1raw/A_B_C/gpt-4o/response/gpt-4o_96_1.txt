To compute the posterior conditional probability using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of being enrolled in each field, the likelihood of observing Adam's traits given that he is in each field, and the total probability of observing Adam's traits across all fields of specialization.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing evidence \( E \), across all fields.

To simplify, let’s assume equal prior probabilities for each field, as specific information about overall enrollments is not provided. Therefore, \( P(H)\) is a constant. The computation then primarily depends on \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's traits given each field.

Given Adam's personality sketch:
- Strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy points towards agricultural and veterinary science
- High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and problem-solving lean towards computer science

Let's assign relative likelihood values for \( P(E|H) \) based on these traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{ag and vet}}) \) is high because of Adam’s traits aligning with the field’s demands.
2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \) is low to moderate, as the personal traits do not strongly indicate a fit, though abstract understanding may still be a relevant skill.
3. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \) is moderate to high due to intelligence and problem-solving aligned with this field.

Since exact numerical values are not given, understand these values are relative.

Let's assume the following relative likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ag and vet}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) = 0.6 \)

Given equal priors \( P(H_{\text{ag and vet}}) = P(H_{\text{business}}) = P(H_{\text{cs}}) \):
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 + 0.6) ≈ 0.53",
  "business administration": "0.2 / (0.8 + 0.2 + 0.6) ≈ 0.13",
  "computer science": "0.6 / (0.8 + 0.2 + 0.6) ≈ 0.40"
}

Therefore, our output is approximately:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.50",
  "business administration": "0.125",
  "computer science": "0.375"
}
```
