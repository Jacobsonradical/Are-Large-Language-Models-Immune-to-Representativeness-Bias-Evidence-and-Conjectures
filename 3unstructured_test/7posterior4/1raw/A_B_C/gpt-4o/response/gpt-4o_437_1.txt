To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field. Since we don't have specific data for these probabilities, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the provided description of Adam's personality.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Empathy and love for animals
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts
- Strong appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can make educated guesses about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's deep love for animals and his curiosity about nature, this field seems highly likely. Therefore, \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is probably high.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are important for this field. Therefore, \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \) is reasonably high but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant, the other traits such as love for animals and nature do not align as closely with this field. Therefore, \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \) is lower.

Without exact figures, we will employ qualitative judgments to assign relative probabilities. For simplicity, let's assume prior probabilities for each field are equal (e.g., \( P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3} \)).

Now, by normalizing the relative likelihoods, we can estimate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Let's assign arbitrary but consistent scales to the likelihoods:
- \( P(E| \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E| \text{computer science}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E| \text{business administration}) \approx 0.1 \)

Normalizing these values, we get:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{\sum_{H'} P(E|H') \cdot P(H')}
\]

1. For **business administration**:
\[
P(\text{business administration}|E) \propto 0.1 \\
\]

2. For **computer science**:
\[
P(\text{computer science}|E) \propto 0.2 \\
\]

3. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \propto 0.7 \\
\]

Normalizing these:

\[
\sum = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.7 = 1.0
\]

So, the normalized probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Note that these probabilities are based on the assumptions and relative scales for the likelihoods. More precise data would refine these estimates.
