To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must consider three components: the prior probability of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence probability \( P(E) \). Unfortunately, without actual data for priors and likelihoods, providing exact numerical values is impossible. 

However, we can make qualitative assessments based on typical characteristics of each field and Adam's personality sketch. 

**Qualitative Assessment and Reasoning:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong indicator given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals.
2. **Computer Science**: Moderate indicator because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
3. **Business Administration**: Low indicator because although Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work, there’s less direct alignment with his interests and personality traits mentioned.

Given these assessments, let’s assign approximate probabilities qualitatively:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These qualitative probabilities assume that:

- Adam's interest in nature and animals heavily influences the choice.
- Adam’s skills in problem-solving and abstract thought align less strongly with computer science than with nature-focused fields.
- Business administration doesn't as clearly fit with Adam's described personality as the other fields.
