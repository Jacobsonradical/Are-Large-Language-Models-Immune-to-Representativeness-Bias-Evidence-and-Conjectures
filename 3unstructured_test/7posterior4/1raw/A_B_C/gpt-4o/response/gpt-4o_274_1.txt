To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes’ rule, we need to consider:

1. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
2. **P(H)**: The prior probability of the hypothesis.
3. **P(E)**: The total probability of the evidence. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific numerical values and priors for each field, I will assume general hypothetical values based on typical graduate student distribution and the sketch of Adam’s personality.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H for Computer Science)**: Students in computer science often exhibit high intelligence and proficiency with abstract concepts and puzzles, both of which align with Adam’s traits. However, traits like empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature are less emphasized in this field.
   - **P(H for Computer Science)**: Computer Science is a popular field among graduate students, potentially around 20% assuming a large university setting for a broad estimate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: This field aligns well with Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **P(H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science)**: This is less common than computer science, potentially around 5% as a rough estimate.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H for Business Administration)**: Empathy and interpersonal skills are relevant, but love for animals, nature curiosity, or solving puzzles are less relevant.
   - **P(H for Business Administration)**: This field is also popular, potentially around 15%.

Given the hypothetical alignment and relative commonness:

\[ 
P(H|E)_{Computer Science} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{Agricultural \& Veterinary Science} \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.05}{P(E)} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|E)_{Business Administration} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{P(E)} 
\]

For simplicity and as an illustrative estimation, the relative values (P(E) is constant for all fields and cancels out in comparison):

\[
{
  "computer science": \frac{0.08}{P(E)} \approx 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \frac{0.045}{P(E)} \approx 0.045,
  "business administration": \frac{0.03}{P(E)} \approx 0.03
}
\]

Note: These are illustrative estimates and actual values would require more precise data:

So, we might have:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.47,
  "business administration": 0.18
}
\]
