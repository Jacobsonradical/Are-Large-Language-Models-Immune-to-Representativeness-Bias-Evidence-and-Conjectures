To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \), i.e., the probability of Adam being enrolled in that field before considering the personality sketch.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, i.e., the total probability of the evidence \( E \) under all possible hypotheses.

We need to make some assumptions regarding \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) as the exact values are not provided. Let's go through each field one by one.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood that he might be enrolled in this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{agri/vet}}) = 0.9 \).
   - **P(H)**: Let's assume that the prior probability of being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science among all graduate fields is relatively low but not negligible. For simplicity, let's set \( P(H_{\text{agri/vet}}) = 0.1 \).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are advantageous in computer science. However, the rest of his personality traits are less indicative of this field. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5 \).
   - **P(H)**: Given the popularity of computer science, let's assume a moderate prior probability of \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's warm heart and empathy may not be directly indicative of a business administration focus, though they are valuable traits. His appreciation for hard work is positive but not conclusive. Let's assume \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.3 \).
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is also a relatively common field, so let's set \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2 \).

Since we cannot compute \( P(E) \) directly, we can compare the relative values instead.

Now, let's normalize these probabilities to estimate \( P(H|E) \) relatively:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.9 * 0.1 / total = 0.09 / total,
  "computer science": 0.5 * 0.2 / total = 0.10 / total,
  "business administration": 0.3 * 0.2 / total = 0.06 / total
}
```

Where `total` is the sum of all unnormalized probabilities:

```
total = 0.09 + 0.10 + 0.06 = 0.25
```

Normalized probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.09 / 0.25 = 0.36,
  "computer science": 0.10 / 0.25 = 0.40,
  "business administration": 0.06 / 0.25 = 0.24
}
```

Combining all this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.36,
  "computer science": 0.40,
  "business administration": 0.24
}
```

These values are relative and assumed based on the given information and standard assumptions about graduate fields.
