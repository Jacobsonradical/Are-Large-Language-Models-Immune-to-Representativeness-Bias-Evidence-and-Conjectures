To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific priors (\( P(H) \)) or the likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)) available, I'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality traits mentioned. 

Given Adam's characteristics:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and its plants,
- Enjoys solving puzzles,
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals,
- High intelligence,
- Good at understanding abstract concepts, and
- An appreciation for hard work and dedication,

Let's proceed with the following qualitative estimation for \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Business administration**:
   - While high intelligence and an appreciation for hard work are relevant, Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't strongly align with this field.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low here.

2. **Computer science**:
   - Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence align well with computer science.
   - However, his empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature don't directly connect.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate here.

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field, making \( P(E|H) \) quite high here.

Since we don't have the exact numbers for the priors and the normalization factor (\( P(E) \)), we will provide qualitative estimates between 0 and 1.

Let's summarize the results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam being in each field based on his personality traits.
