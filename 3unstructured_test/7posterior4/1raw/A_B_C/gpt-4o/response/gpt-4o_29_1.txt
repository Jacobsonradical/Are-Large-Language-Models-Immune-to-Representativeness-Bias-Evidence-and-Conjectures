To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the personality sketch given each field of study. However, since we don't have exact numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the provided sketch. 

Bayes’ theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we'll assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are uniform across all fields, meaning each field is equally likely to be a student's field of study before considering any additional information. Thus, we can focus solely on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). We'll use the personality sketch to inform our likelihood values.

Now, let’s evaluate each field based on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

- **Business administration**: 
  - The personality traits of curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy do not strongly align with common traits expected in business administration. 
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is low.

- **Computer science**: 
  - The traits of high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. However, his love for nature and animals is less pertinent. This gives a mixed likelihood.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is moderate.

- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: 
  - The curiosity about nature, deep love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences. These fields fit the described traits very well.
  - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary sciences is high.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can assign relative probability values within the range [0, 1] to each field based on their likelihood. These values are not based on precise calculations but rather on the qualitative fit:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods based on how well Adam's personality and interests align with each field of study.
