To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities P(H) and the likelihoods P(E|H). Without specific data, we will need to make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch E and the typical enrollment probabilities for these fields.

We are looking for P(H|E) for the following fields:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)
- Computer Science (H2)
- Business Administration (H3)

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To simplify, we will estimate the likelihood P(E|H) based on the given sketch and assume uniform priors for P(H) since we do not have specific prior data. P(E) can be considered constant for comparison purposes and thus be ignored in our ratio since we are comparing across fields.

### Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**
   - **P(E|H1)**: High. Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals strongly correlates with this field.
   - **P(H1)**: Let's assume moderate likelihood due to fewer students compared to computer science and business.

2. **Computer Science (H2)**
   - **P(E|H2)**: Moderate. Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fits well, but there's no mention of tech or computers.
   - **P(H2)**: Higher prior due to the field's popularity.

3. **Business Administration (H3)**
   - **P(E|H3)**: Low. The sketch does not clearly align with typical characteristics associated with business.
   - **P(H3)**: Moderate to high prior due to the field's general popularity.

Given the qualitative nature of the data and the uniform prior assumption, our posterior probabilities will reflect the matching degree of the sketch to each field.

### Posterior Probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values represent plausible estimates based on the given personality sketch E and a priori assumptions about the base rate enrollments in each field.
