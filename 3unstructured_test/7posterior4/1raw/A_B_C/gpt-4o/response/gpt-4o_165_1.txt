To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, we need to apply Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability that Adam has his personality traits given that he is in a particular field).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the base rate prevalence of that field among graduate students).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence (the overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits regardless of his field).

Though precise numerical values would require more detailed statistical data, we can qualitatively estimate the probabilities by considering the fit between Adam's personality traits and typical students in these fields.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it seems highly likely that he could be enrolled in this field. This field aligns well with many of his described traits.
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts, which are good fits for computer science. However, his empathy and love for animals do not directly point to this field.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication would be beneficial in business administration, his deep love for animals and nature, as well as his quiet demeanor, seem less relevant for this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's assign approximate probabilities:

\[ \text{Normalized posterior probabilities required qualitative assessment to avoid total sum being 1.} \]

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Note: The exact numeric values could vary with more detailed contextual data. These values provide a qualitative estimate based on the given personality sketch and typical characteristics of students in these fields.
