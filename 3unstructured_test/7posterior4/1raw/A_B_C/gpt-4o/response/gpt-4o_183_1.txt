To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not only Adam's described traits but also the base rates of students enrolled in each field. However, since we do not have the exact base rates, we'll proceed by making qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch.

The relevant traits from the sketch are:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

We can compute posterior probabilities qualitatively based on how well Adam's traits fit with the typical characteristics of students in each field. We need to consider how likely it is for students in each field to exhibit these traits.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with computer science.
   - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals might be less relevant.
   - Typical computer science students might not always have a deep connection with nature and animals.
   - Probability: Moderate
   
2. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication fits.
   - Empathy could be relevant in managerial roles but curiosity about nature is less pertinent.
   - Business students typically focus on finance, management, rather remote from solving puzzles or deep love for animals.
   - Probability: Low

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and a deep love for animals, align perfectly.
   - Strong empathy is highly valuable in veterinary science.
   - High intelligence and abstract problem-solving can be useful in scientific research.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is significant in this field.
   - Probability: High

Based on this qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Please note that these probabilities are not exact figures but are estimated judgments based on how well Adam's personality and interests align with common characteristics of students in each field. To compute exact probabilities, we would need more specific data on enrollment rates and how these traits distribute among the student population in these fields.
