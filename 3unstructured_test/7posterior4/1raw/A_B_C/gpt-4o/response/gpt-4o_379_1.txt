To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific values for \( P(H) \) (the prior probability of each field) or \( P(E) \) (the marginal probability of observing Adam's traits regardless of the field), we'll focus on a qualitative estimate based on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of Adam having the described traits if he were in a specific field.

Let's analyze each field in the context of Adam's personality sketch:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically requires social, strategic, and leadership skills.
   - Adam's traits include empathy and a deep love for animals—traits which don’t directly align with business administration.
   
   Thus, \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is likely low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Computer Science programs often attract individuals who have high intelligence and enjoy solving puzzles—traits that are part of Adam’s personality.
   - However, computer science doesn’t directly correlate with a love for nature and animals.
   
   Thus, \( P(E|H) \) for computer science is moderate.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field aligns strongly with Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Empathy and appreciation for dedication fit well with this field, as it involves care for living beings and often requires hands-on work with plants and animals.
   
   Thus, \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is high.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign approximate values as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods based on Adam’s personality traits and how well they match each field.
