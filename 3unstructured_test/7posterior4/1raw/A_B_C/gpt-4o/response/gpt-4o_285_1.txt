To calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of the personality sketch given each hypothesis. Without concrete priors and likelihoods, we can only make qualitative estimates based on the information provided. Bayesian updates are more precise with specific data, but here we can reason through likely values.

Generally, we can think of this reasoning in terms of:

1. **Likelihood**: How consistent is Adam's personality sketch with the traits typically associated with each field?
2. **Prior Probability**: Generically, the popularity of each field among graduate students, although this would ideally be customized based on specific data if available.

Given Adam's traits:
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Enjoys solving puzzles
- Empathetic and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and abstract thinking
- Appreciation for hard work and dedication

Now, let's qualitatively estimate these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Curiosity in abstract problem-solving aligns with computer science.
   - Not much direct mention of affinity for technology or computing specifics.
  
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong alignment with curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
   - Empathy fits well with veterinary care.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is relevant.
   - Less direct alignment with empathy, love of nature, or puzzle-solving as core traits.

Based on these logical steps, let's make some qualitative estimates:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Agricultural and veterinary science** comes out strong due to multiple direct alignments with Adam's traits.
- **Computer science** has some alignment through problem-solving and potentially abstract thinking.
- **Business administration** has the least alignment given the personality sketch provided. This doesn't mean it's impossible, but less likely compared to the other fields mentioned.
