To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field given Adam's personality sketch, we'll use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact base rates \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are not given, we will need to make reasonable assumptions based on the information available in the personality sketch to estimate these probabilities.

1. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, he could be a good fit for computer science. However, the personality sketch does not strongly highlight skills or interests directly related to this field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a strong alignment with this field. This makes it highly likely that this could be his field of study.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam is intelligent and appreciates hard work and dedication, there is no specific indication in the personality sketch that he is interested in business-oriented skills or concepts.

Based on these subjective evaluations, we can approximate the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
```

These values reflect the stronger alignment of the personality sketch with agricultural and veterinary science, while computer science and business administration are less aligned based on the provided characteristics.
