To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we can use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

However, we don't have the exact numerical values for these probabilities. Instead, we can use qualitative reasoning to estimate relative probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's interests and traits, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field can be assessed as follows:

1. **Business Administration**: Adam's personality traits (curiosity about nature, empathy, love for animals) don't strongly indicate an interest in business administration. The likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is low.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, which align with the skills needed in computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals doesn't strongly correlate with this field. The likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. The likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high.

Without exact priors, we'll assume base rates to be approximately equal for simplicity but adjusted slightly based on typical enrollment numbers. Based on qualitative assessment, we can approximate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the relative fit between Adam's personality and each field, with a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science, moderate for computer science, and low for business administration.
