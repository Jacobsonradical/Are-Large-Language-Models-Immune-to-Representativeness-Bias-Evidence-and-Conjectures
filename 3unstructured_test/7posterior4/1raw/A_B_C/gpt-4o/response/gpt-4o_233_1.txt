To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch \(E\) given that he is in each field \(H\) and the prior probabilities of each field. Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior and likelihood values, we cannot provide exact numerical probabilities. Instead, I'll discuss the qualitative aspects that lead us to a rough estimation of the probabilities.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Fit with Sketch (E)**: Strong. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, interest in plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals align very well with this field.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: High, given the evident correlation between his personality traits and this field of study.
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Depending on demographics, this field might have a lower enrollment compared to others but still relevant.

### Business Administration
- **Fit with Sketch (E)**: Weak. Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts might not align as strongly with business administration. His empathy and warm heart might be beneficial in some aspects of business like HR or CSR, but this is less direct.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Low, since the sketch doesn’t strongly correlate with typical business administration traits.
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: This field tends to have high enrollment, which might slightly elevate its probability in absence of specific individual traits fitting it.

### Computer Science
- **Fit with Sketch (E)**: Moderate. Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts aligns well with a field like computer science. However, his love for nature and animals might not be as directly relevant.
- **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Moderate, due to a good correlation with interests in puzzles and abstract thinking.
- **Prior \(P(H)\)**: Likely high due to the increasing demand and enrollment in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are rough estimates of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: The high fit with the personality sketch (nature, empathy, animals) makes this field the most likely for Adam.
- Business Administration: The weak alignment with Adam's traits makes this the least likely field.
- Computer Science: The fit with Adam's interest in puzzles and abstract concepts makes this field moderately plausible. 

Note that the values are qualitative estimates and would need empirical priors and likelihoods for accurate computation.
