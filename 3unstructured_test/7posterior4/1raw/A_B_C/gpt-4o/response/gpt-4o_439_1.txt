To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule, which is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (which is the probability of Adam being enrolled in that field before considering the personality sketch).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \) (which can be seen as a normalizing constant).

Since we don’t have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and the normalizing constant \( P(E) \), we will rely on the personality sketch and use qualitative reasoning to estimate the relative probabilities.

Given the evidence (personality sketch \( E \)), let’s assess each field:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Adam has a **genuine curiosity about nature and its plants**.
   - He has a **deep love for animals**.
   - High appreciation for hard work and dedication is also relevant in this field.
   - These traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

   Hence, the estimated posterior probability for agricultural and veterinary science is relatively high.

2. **Computer science:**
   - Adam **enjoys solving puzzles** and is **good at understanding abstract concepts**.
   - High intelligence and technical problem-solving skills are relevant to computer science.
   - However, the personality sketch does not emphasize characteristics most directly associated with computer science, such as a passion for technology or coding.

   Therefore, the estimated posterior probability for computer science is moderate.

3. **Business administration:**
   - While Adam may appreciate hard work and dedication, there is no mention of interests or activities directly related to business administration such as leadership, management, or interest in commerce.
   - The personality traits described do not specifically align with those typically associated with business administration.

   As a result, the estimated posterior probability for business administration is relatively low.

So the estimated posterior probabilities could be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the alignment between the personality sketch and typical attributes of each field. In a rigorous analysis, actual data and statistical models would refine these estimates.
