To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need the following probabilities for this computation:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in each specified field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Let's assume the following:

- \( P(E) \) is constant for all fields.
- \( P(H) \) for a graduate student in the U.S. can be assumed to be equally likely across all fields initially, but we will differentiate them based on some general knowledge about the prevalence of these fields.
- \( P(E|H) \) will vary based on how well the personality sketch matches typical students in each field.

Based on Adam's personality sketch \( E \):

- **Computer Science:** While Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills fit this field, his deep love for nature and animals doesn't strongly align. So, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work strongly match this field. So, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
- **Business Administration:** While his intelligence and appreciation for hard work are relevant, his love for animals and nature is less relevant for this field. So, \( P(E|H) \) is low to moderate.

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity (i.e., 1/3 for each field):

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) (moderate fit) = 0.3
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) (high fit) = 0.7
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) (low to moderate fit) = 0.2

Now we can normalize to ensure the probabilities are relative within the given set. We set:

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx 0.3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.7 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.233 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.067 \]

I will normalize these values to get final results (dividing each by the sum of values):

\[ Total = 0.1 + 0.233 + 0.067 = 0.4 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.1}{0.4} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.233}{0.4} \approx 0.5825 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.067}{0.4} \approx 0.1675 \]

So the final answers are:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5825",
  "business administration": "0.1675"
}
