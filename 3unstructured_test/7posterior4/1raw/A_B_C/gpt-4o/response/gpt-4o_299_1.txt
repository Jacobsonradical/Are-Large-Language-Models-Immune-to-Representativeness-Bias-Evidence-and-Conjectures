To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability of each hypothesis (field) without considering the evidence.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. **Normalizing constant \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of the evidence across all hypotheses (this ensures the posterior probabilities sum to 1).

Bayes' Rule formula is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without actual numerical data for these components, we will make reasoned assumptions based on general trends:

1. **Prior probabilities \( P(H) \)**: Assume equal priors for simplicity (you can also adjust them depending on the commonality of fields among graduate students).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This depends on how well the given evidence matches the characteristics of students in each field.

Let’s make some educated estimations:
- **Computer Science**: Because Adam has high intelligence and likes solving puzzles, this field has moderate compatibility.
- **Business Administration**: This field is not strongly suggested by Adam's interests.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong compatibility given Adam’s curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.

### Let's estimate these likelihoods:

- \( P(E|Computer Science) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|Business Administration) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.8 \)

Given equal priors, we will assume:
- \( P(Computer Science) = 1/3 \)
- \( P(Business Administration) = 1/3 \)
- \( P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 1/3 \)

The normalization constant \( P(E) \) will be the sum of all \( P(E|H)P(H) \).

Let's calculate:
\[
P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA) + P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
P(E) = \frac{0.4}{3} + \frac{0.1}{3} + \frac{0.8}{3} = \frac{1.3}{3} \approx 0.4333
\]

Now, let's plug these into Bayes' Rule:

- For Computer Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} \approx 0.308
\]

- For Business Administration:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{BA}} = \frac{P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} \approx 0.077
\]

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[
P(H|E)_{\text{AVS}} = \frac{P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4333} \approx 0.615
\]

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.308,
  "business administration": 0.077,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.615
}
