To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to compute:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific prior probabilities or detailed numerical evidence for these probabilities, we will need to base our estimates on qualitative judgment about how well Adam's characteristics match each field of study.

1. **Business Administration**: Business administration doesn't strongly align with Adam's interests in nature, plants, solving puzzles, animals, or even abstract concepts compared to the other fields listed. Therefore, both \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) might be considered lower.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align closely with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \) will likely be higher.

3. **Computer Science**: While Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and solving puzzles, these align reasonably well with computer science. However, his strong interest in nature and animals is less of a fit.

Using qualitative judgment, we might estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.70",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}

These values are indicative and based on the subjective fit between Adam's personality traits and the nature of the fields mentioned.
