To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we will need to break down the computation as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not provided, I'll provide reasonable estimates based on the typical characteristics associated with each field and the given personality sketch of Adam.

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):

Let's consider prior probabilities based on graduate student enrollment trends in specific fields (using approximate and hypothetical values for simplicity):
- Business administration: \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% of graduate students)
- Computer science: \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \) (30% of graduate students)
- Agricultural and veterinary science: \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (10% of graduate students)

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

Evaluate how likely the personality sketch \( E \) fits each field \( H \):

- **Business administration**: A genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are not particularly strong indicators of a focus in business, though intelligence and appreciation for hard work might be somewhat associated.
  - \( P(E|H)_{BA} \approx 0.1 \)
  
- **Computer science**: Intelligence and understanding abstract concepts fit well, as well as enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less relevant.
  - \( P(E|H)_{CS} \approx 0.3 \)
  
- **Agricultural and veterinary science**: Curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and dedication are strong indicators for this field.
  - \( P(E|H)_{AVS} \approx 0.8 \)

### Total Probability \( P(E) \):

Total probability of \( E \) can be approximated by summing up contributions from all hypotheses:

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot 0.2) + (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.02 + 0.09 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.19 \]

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

Using Bayes' rule to compute:

1. **Business administration**:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.19} \approx 0.105 \]

2. **Computer science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.19} \approx 0.474 \]

3. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.19} \approx 0.421 \]

### Results:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.105,
  "computer science": 0.474,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.421
}
```

Note that these probabilities are approximations and depend on the chosen prior probabilities and likelihood estimations.
