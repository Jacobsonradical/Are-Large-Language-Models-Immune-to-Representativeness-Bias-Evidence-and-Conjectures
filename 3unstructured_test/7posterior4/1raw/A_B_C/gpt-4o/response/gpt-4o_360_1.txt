To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, I will consider the provided personality traits and the likelihood of each field corresponding with these traits. However, exact numerical probabilities require specific prior data, which is not provided. Instead, I can give qualitative assessments that directly relate to the likelihood based on the given attributes.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given the evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence \(E\) given the hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \(E\).

Given the lack of specific numerical priors or marginal probabilities, I will provide a qualitative assessment. 

- **Business Administration:** Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, it's less likely he would choose a field primarily focused on business management and operations, unless it involves sustainability or environmental management. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** This field perfectly aligns with Adam's interest in nature, plants, animals, and his strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. Hence, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is very high for this field.

- **Computer Science:** Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable traits in computer science. However, his personality description does not strongly emphasize technology or computational interests, making \( P(E|H) \) moderate for this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihoods but remember that without specific priors and marginal probabilities, these are best-guess estimates based on the information given.
