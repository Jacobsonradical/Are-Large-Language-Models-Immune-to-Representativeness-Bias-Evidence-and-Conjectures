To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for Adam being enrolled in each of the fields.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given he is in each field.

Bayes' rule is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have exact numerical values for the priors or the likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative assessment.

Let's assume some qualitative reasoning:

1. **business administration**: Adam's profile doesn't strongly align with typical business administration students, as they often have more interest in leadership, management, and business strategy rather than nature, empathy, and abstract puzzles.
   
2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: This field fits quite well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

3. **computer science**: Computer Science might align with his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, however, the love for nature and empathy for animals are not typical characteristics for this field.

Based on these considerations, I'll qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

- **business administration** is assigned a lower probability since the traits don't align well.
- **agricultural and veterinary science** is assigned a higher probability due to the strong match with Adam's traits.
- **computer science** has a moderate probability due to the alignment with his intelligence and puzzle-solving nature, but with less alignment on empathy and nature-related interests.
