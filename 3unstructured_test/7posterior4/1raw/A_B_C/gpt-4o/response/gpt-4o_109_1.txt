To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack the exact probabilities needed to compute this equation accurately (e.g., \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \)). Instead, we can make qualitative estimates based on the provided information. Let's consider how well Adam's personality aligns with each field of study:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Strength**: High intelligence, good at solving puzzles, understanding abstract concepts.
   - **Weakness**: Interests predominantly in nature, plants, and animals.
   - **Estimate**: Medium/low probability due to some matching traits but a difference in primary interests.

2. **Business Administration:**
   - **Strength**: Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - **Weakness**: Less directly aligned with his love for nature, animals, and solving abstract puzzles.
   - **Estimate**: Low probability due to limited alignment with his primary interests and personality.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Strength**: Genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - **Weakness**: High intelligence and abstract reasoning might be relevant but less central.
   - **Estimate**: High probability due to strong alignment with his interests and traits.

Based on this qualitative reasoning, the estimated posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These estimates reflect the alignment between Adam's personality sketch and each field of specialization.
