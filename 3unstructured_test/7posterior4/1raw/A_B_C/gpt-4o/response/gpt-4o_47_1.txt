To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider both the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Although the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, we can qualitatively assess the fit between Adam's personality traits and each field. However, precise numerical values would require specific data. For simplicity, I will base the likelihoods and prior beliefs on the available information:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Computer Science is a common field, especially in the U.S.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well, but his love for nature and animals is less aligned.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Less common than Computer Science, but not rare.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Very high, given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: Fairly common field.
   - **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: Although high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit, the other traits like empathy and love for nature are less relevant.

Given these qualitative assessments, I'll assign approximate values based on fit:

\[
P(E) = \text{A normalizing constant, ignored for ratio comparisons}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{computer science} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \approx 0.6 \\
P(\text{business administration} | E) &= \frac{P(E | \text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \approx 0.2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values suggest that, given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
