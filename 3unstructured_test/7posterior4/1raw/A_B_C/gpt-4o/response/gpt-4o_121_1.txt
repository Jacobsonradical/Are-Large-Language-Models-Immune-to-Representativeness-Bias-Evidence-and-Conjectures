To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field \( H \) given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

Given the lack of specific numerical data, we'll make reasonable qualitative estimates based on the information given about Adam's personality sketch and common characteristics associated with each field of study.

1. **Business Administration:**

   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low likelihood, as Adam's interests and personality traits (curiosity about nature, puzzles, love for animals) are not strongly aligned with typical characteristics of business administration students.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Assumed to be moderate based on general enrollment rates in business administration programs.
   - \( P(E) \): Normalized over all considered fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - \( P(E|H_{AG}) \): High likelihood, as Adam's traits (love for nature, animals, and empathy) are highly relevant to this field.
   - \( P(H_{AG}) \): Assumed to be lower than business administration but reasonable due to the specialized nature of the field.
   - \( P(E) \): Normalized over all considered fields.

3. **Computer Science:**

   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate likelihood, as Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align well with computer science, but his love for nature and animals is less relevant.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): Assumed to be high given the popularity of computer science programs.
   - \( P(E) \): Normalized over all considered fields.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can approximate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.70",
  "computer science": "0.25"
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch aligns most closely with agricultural and veterinary science, moderately with computer science, and least with business administration.
