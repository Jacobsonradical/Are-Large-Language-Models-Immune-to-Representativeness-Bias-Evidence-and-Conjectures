To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in different fields given his personality sketch \( E \), we use Bayes' rule, which is expressed as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without the actual prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of Adam being in each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only estimate these based on the information given in the personality sketch. Let's denote:

- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field. 
- \( P(E|H) \) as the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given he is in that field.

Given Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals, agricultural and veterinary science seems more aligned with his interests. His intelligence and problem-solving skills can lead toward either computer science or any field requiring analytical thinking, but his empathy and warm-hearted nature might be less typical in business administration compared to the other fields.

Here are some reasonable qualitative estimates for the likelihoods:

- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be high due to his curiosity about nature and love for animals.
- For **computer science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate due to his intelligence and problem-solving skills, though his love for nature and animals is less relevant.
- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) might be low because the focus areas of this field don't clearly align with his described interests and personality traits.

Since \( P(E) \) is a constant across all hypotheses and assuming \( P(H) \) is initially equal for all, \( P(H) \) cancels out when comparing the fields.

Thus, our estimates for the posterior probabilities could be represented approximately as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values represent our best estimates given the available information and the need to rely on qualitative assessment.
