To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the relative likelihoods of Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in each specific field \( H \). Bayes' Rule can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing evidence \( E \), which is a normalization factor to ensure probabilities sum to 1.

### Assumptions:
1. We do not know the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field without additional data, so we'll assume they are equally likely for the purpose of this exercise.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \) depends on how well Adam's personality traits fit with each field of study.

Given Adam's personality traits, it is more likely for him to be enrolled in a field related to nature and animals (such as agricultural and veterinary science) compared to business administration, which typically may not heavily feature these interests.

We assign the likelihoods as:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

Assuming equal priors, \( P(H) \) for each field is the same and can be normalized out, simplifying comparisons.

Without knowledge of the exact normalization constant \( P(E) \), we express answers in relative terms:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}
```

This relative likelihood reflects that Adam's personality sketch is most compatible with agricultural and veterinary science, partly compatible with computer science, and least compatible with business administration.
