To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we need to utilize Bayes' rule. However, since we don’t have specific numerical prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll reason descriptively based on the given personality sketch of Adam and make educated estimates.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's the qualitative assessment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in business administration) seems low given his strong affinity for nature, animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of a graduate student being in business administration) can be moderate to high considering it’s a common field.
   - Considering \( P(E) \) (overall probability of observing Adam's personality traits) as a constant factor for normalization across fields:
   - We might estimate a lower value for \( P(H|E) \) here.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in agricultural and veterinary science) is high given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of a graduate student being in this field) might be lower than business administration, but still non-negligible.
   - Given both the match to personality and moderate priors, \( P(H|E) \) should be relatively high.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) (probability of observing Adam's personality traits if he were in computer science) can be moderate given his intelligence and interest in solving puzzles and abstract concepts.
   - \( P(H) \) (prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science) is quite high due to the popularity and demand of the field.
   - Given the alignment of some of Adam's traits with this field, \( P(H|E) \) can be moderately high.

Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods based on the available qualitative descriptions. Note that these are educated estimates to illustrate the application of Bayes' rule qualitatively. For precise calculation, specific numerical priors and likelihoods would be required.
