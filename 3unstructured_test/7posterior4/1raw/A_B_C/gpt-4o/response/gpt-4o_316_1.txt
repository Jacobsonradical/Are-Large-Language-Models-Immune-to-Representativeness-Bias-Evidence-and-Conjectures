To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand some probabilities, notably the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' Rule in this case is:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \( P(E) \) is common across all fields for our normalization purposes, it can be considered a constant scaling factor. Therefore, for the purposes of this example, we can focus on the relative values rather than computing the exact probabilities.

Given that we are working with qualitative probabilities, we will make informed estimates:

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's description includes high intelligence and aptitude for abstract concepts, which fits well with computer science. However, there is no specific mention of interest in technology or computing.
2. **Business Administration**: Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work fit well, but the interest in nature and animals make it less likely than the other fields.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align very closely with this field.

We will estimate the likelihoods based on Adam's profile:

- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) (computer science): Moderate to high
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) (business administration): Moderate
- \( P(E|H_{ags}) \) (agricultural and veterinary science): High

If we assume non-informative priors (all fields are equally likely before considering the personality sketch), we can then relatively compare \( P(E|H) \) values:

\[
\begin{cases}
P(H_{cs}|E) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) \\
P(H_{ba}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba}) \\
P(H_{ags}|E) \propto P(E|H_{ags}) \cdot P(H_{ags})
\end{cases}
\]

Assuming equal priors, let's give rough estimates for relative likelihoods:

- \( P(E|H_{cs}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H_{ba}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{ags}) \approx 0.8 \)

Thus, the posterior probabilities, after normalization, can be approximated as fractions of these values relative to their sum:

\[
P(H_{cs}|E) \approx \frac{0.5}{0.5 + 0.3 + 0.8} \approx \frac{0.5}{1.6} \approx 0.3125
\]
\[
P(H_{ba}|E) \approx \frac{0.3}{0.5 + 0.3 + 0.8} \approx \frac{0.3}{1.6} \approx 0.1875
\]
\[
P(H_{ags}|E) \approx \frac{0.8}{0.5 + 0.3 + 0.8} \approx \frac{0.8}{1.6} \approx 0.5
\]

Summarizing these in the requested format:

{
  "computer science": "0.3125",
  "business administration": "0.1875",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5"
}

Note: These values are rough estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise mathematical calculation.
