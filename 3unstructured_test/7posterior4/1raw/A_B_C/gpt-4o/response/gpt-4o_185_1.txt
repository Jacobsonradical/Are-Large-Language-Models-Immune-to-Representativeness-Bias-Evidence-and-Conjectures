To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of each field, \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field, \( P(E|H) \). Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is constant for all hypotheses, we can compare the posterior probabilities relatively, focusing on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

Given the information about Adam, let's make reasonable assumptions for each component.

- **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: This reflects the general distribution of graduate students in each field. For simplicity, assume equal priors for each field since we lack specific data.

\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}) = P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = P(H_{\text{BA}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This reflects how well Adam's personality sketch matches each field.

  - **Computer Science (CS)**: High intelligence and abstract thought align well, but the emphasis is less on nature, plants, animals.
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**: Strong fit with curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
  - **Business Administration (BA)**: Less aligned with the personality traits listed, focusing more on empathy and teamwork skills used in business contexts.

For simplicity, let's assign the following arbitrary values to \( P(E|H) \) reflecting a qualitative assessment:
  
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \)

Now, we can compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities:

\[ 
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.2}{3} \approx 0.0667 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.7}{3} \approx 0.2333 
\]

\[ 
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{0.1}{3} \approx 0.0333 
\]

The actual posterior probabilities are found by normalizing these values so they sum to 1 (but we'll present the unnormalized values as requested):
