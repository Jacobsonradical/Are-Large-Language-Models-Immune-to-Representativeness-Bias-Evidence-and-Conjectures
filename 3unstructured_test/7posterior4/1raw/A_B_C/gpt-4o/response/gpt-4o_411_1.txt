To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we don't have the numerical values for these probabilities, so we will give a qualitative assessment based on the provided personality sketch (E) and our knowledge about the characteristics of students in each field of study (H).

### Understanding the Components:
- **P(E|H)**: The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.
- **P(H)**: The prior probability of a graduate student being in that field.
- **P(E)**: The overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch, let's qualitatively evaluate \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has empathy, and a deep love for animals. This fits very well with someone studying agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): High

2. **Business Administration**:
   - While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit, the specific traits related to plants, nature, and empathy do not strongly align with typical traits for business administration.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): Low

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Intelligence and an enjoyment of solving puzzles fit well with computer science. However, a love for nature, plants, and animals is less relevant.
   - \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): Medium

### Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \):
- Let’s assume a roughly equal interest across a broad range of fields in a graduate student population without specific data.

### Overall Probability \( P(E) \):
- This is hard to estimate without data, so we use it as a normalizing constant.

### Posterior Probabilities:
Using qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Given the assumptions:
- Agricultural and veterinary science have the highest fit given Adam's personality sketch, hence the higher probability.
- Business administration has a low probability since Adam's traits don’t strongly align with common business administration traits.
- Computer science has some fit due to the enjoyment of puzzles and intelligence, but less alignment with nature-based interests. 

Note: These values are heuristic and depend on context and population data, should numerical values be known, the actual calculation may differ.
