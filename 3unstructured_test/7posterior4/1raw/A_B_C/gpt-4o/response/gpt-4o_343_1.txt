To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), we can only reason qualitatively based on the given personality sketch.

Let's evaluate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Typically, this field may attract individuals interested in commerce, leadership, and management. Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and love for animals do not directly align with the typical traits for business administration.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is likely to be relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - This field aligns well with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \) is likely to be high.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - This field might attract individuals interested in solving puzzles and abstract concepts, which suits Adam's high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles. However, it doesn't directly align with his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) might be moderate.

Now, let's hypothesize prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for simplicity:
- Let's assume in the general population of graduate students, the distribution among these fields is fairly equal.

Given this qualitative assessment, here is a reasonable estimation:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.2"
}

This distribution reflects a higher posterior probability for Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his described personality traits, with moderate probability for computer science due to his solving puzzle skills and lower probability for business administration.
