To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) using Bayes' Rule, we'll need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field, the prior probability \( P(H) \) of being enrolled in that field, and the evidence (or normalization factor) \( P(E) \).

Bayes' Rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For our purposes, \( P(E) \) can be viewed as a normalizing constant across the hypotheses and thus we can focus on the relative comparison of \( P(E|H)P(H) \) for each field.

Given the following considerations:
- Adam has a high likelihood of being drawn to fields involving deep understanding, empathy, and a love for animals.
- Adam's interest in nature and puzzles suggests an inclination towards scientifically rigorous and nature-oriented fields.

Let's assume prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are relatively uniform across fields before knowing \( E \).

1. **business administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) for business administration may be relatively low because Adam's characteristics are not typical of those primarily associated with business administration students.
   - Business students often have a curiosity about markets, organizations, and economics rather than nature and animals.

2. **computer science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) for computer science might be moderate. The quiet demeanor and puzzle-solving interest do match traits of many computer science students, but the strong love for animals and nature might not be as strongly linked.
   - There are some computer science specializations related to nature (e.g., bioinformatics, environmental data science), but these are less common.

3. **agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science would be high. Adamâ€™s characteristics, such as empathy, love for animals, understanding of hard work, and curiosity about nature, align very strongly with this field.

Taking these qualitative assessments into account, here are the approximate posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood based on the personality traits provided in the sketch of Adam and common knowledge of the characteristics of students in these fields.
