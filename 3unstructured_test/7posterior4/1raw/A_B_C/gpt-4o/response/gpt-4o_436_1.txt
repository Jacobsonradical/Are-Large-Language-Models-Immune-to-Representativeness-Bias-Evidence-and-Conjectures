To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis (field of study). 

In the absence of specific numerical prior probabilities and likelihoods, it is common to estimate them based on the given information. Let's consider the qualitative details provided in the personality sketch (E) and how they match with the selected fields (H).

1. **Business Administration:**
   - While Adam's personality sketch mentions high intelligence, empathy, and problem-solving skills, these traits are somewhat relevant to business administration. However, there is no direct mention of interest in business, management, finance, or entrepreneurship.
   - Estimated likelihood \( P(E|H_{business}) \): relatively low.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals directly align with agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also matches the demands of this field.
   - Estimated likelihood \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): high.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are highly relevant to computer science. However, there is no explicit mention of an interest in coding, algorithms, or technology.
   - Estimated likelihood \( P(E|H_{computer}) \): moderate.

Based on the qualitative assessment, let's assign estimated probabilities to each field. Note that these values are subjective estimates for the purpose of this exercise.
