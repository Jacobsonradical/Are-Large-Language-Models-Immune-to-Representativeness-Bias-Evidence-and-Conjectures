To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall (marginal) probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Given that exact likelihoods, priors, and the marginal probability are not provided, we must make reasonable estimations based on the description of Adam and typical characteristics associated with each field. Let's estimate these probabilities qualitatively:

### Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)
- **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suggest a fit. However, the personality sketch leans more towards nature, empathy, and animals, which are not strong associations for this field. Let's estimate a lower likelihood, say 0.2.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for nature, animals, and his warm heart and empathy strongly align with this field. Let's estimate a high likelihood, say 0.8.
- **Business Administration**: While Adam's intelligence and understanding of hard work might fit, his personality traits are less aligned with the typical skills and interests for this field. Let's estimate a low likelihood, say 0.1.

### Priors \( P(H) \)
The prior probabilities are trickier since they depend on the relative popularity or enrollment rates in these fields for graduate students:

- **Computer Science**: A popular field, let's assume prior \( P(H) \) as 0.3.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Less common than Computer Science but still relevant due to increased interest in sustainability. Let's assume prior \( P(H) \) as 0.2.
- **Business Administration**: Also a popular graduate field, let’s assume prior \( P(H) \) as 0.3.

### Marginal Probability \( P(E) \)
This is the probability of Adam having the described traits irrespective of the field. It can be approximated by summing the weighted likelihoods across the fields, adjusted by their priors. This value will effectively normalize our posterior probabilities but does not need to be explicitly computed for this comparison since it's a constant.

### Posterior Probabilities \( P(H|E) \)
Let’s compute the unnormalized posterior probabilities and then normalize them:

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06, \\
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16, \\
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) & \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03.
\end{aligned}
\]

Normalize these values by dividing by their sum to convert them into proper probabilities:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0.06 + 0.16 + 0.03 = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.25} = 0.24, \quad
P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) = \frac{0.16}{0.25} = 0.64, \quad
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.25} = 0.12
\]

So, the posterior probabilities are:

\[
\{
  \text{"computer science"}: 0.24, \\
  \text{"agricultural and veterinary science"}: 0.64, \\
  \text{"business administration"}: 0.12
\}
\]

Thus, Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science based on the given personality sketch.
