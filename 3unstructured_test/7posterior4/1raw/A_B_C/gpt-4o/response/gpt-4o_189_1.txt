To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know a few things:

1. The prior probability for each field, \( P(H) \).
2. The likelihood of the evidence given each field, \( P(E|H) \).
3. The marginal probability of the evidence, \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the actual numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the information given in the personality sketch \( E \). Note that this will be a qualitative estimation.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, it's reasonable to assume that \( P(E|H) \) is quite high. If we assume Adam's personality strongly aligns with this field, we can estimate:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet}}) \approx 0.8 \]

2. **Business Administration**: This field does not align closely with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. While he may have some traits beneficial in business, such as high intelligence and puzzle-solving skills, they are not specific indicators for this field:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{bus_admin}}) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Computer Science**: Adam has strong analytical skills and enjoys solving puzzles, both important in computer science. However, his inclination towards nature and animals is less aligned with this field:
\[ P(E|H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \approx 0.5 \]

For the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), we might assume equal priors if no other information is available, so:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}) = P(H_{\text{bus_admin}}) = P(H_{\text{comp_sci}}) = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

To normalize, we would have to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agri_vet}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}) + P(E|H_{\text{bus_admin}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{bus_admin}}) + P(E|H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{comp_sci}}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.333 + 0.2 \cdot 0.333 + 0.5 \cdot 0.333 \approx 0.533 \]

Now, we can update the posterior probabilities:
\[ P(H_{\text{agri_vet}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.333}{0.533} \approx 0.5 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{bus_admin}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.333}{0.533} \approx 0.125 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{comp_sci}}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.333}{0.533} \approx 0.3125 \]

To summarize:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "computer science": 0.3125
}
```

These values give a qualitative estimate based on the assumptions made about Adam's personality traits and typical alignment with various fields of study.
