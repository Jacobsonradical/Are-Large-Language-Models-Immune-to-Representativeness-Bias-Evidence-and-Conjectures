To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we first need to recognize that Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality sketch E.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of observing the personality sketch E given that Adam was enrolled in field H.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in field H.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch E, regardless of his field.

Since exact numerical values for \(P(E|H)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(E)\) are not provided, we need to make some reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

### Reasonable Assumptions:
1. **P(E|H for Computer Science):** Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits well with a Computer Science background. However, his love for nature and animals is not typically associated with this field, thus this probability might be moderate.

2. **P(E|H for Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** Adamâ€™s deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy strongly align with this field, making this probability high.

3. **P(E|H for Business Administration):** Adam's quiet disposition, empathy, and love for animals are not typically characteristic of Business Administration graduates, so this probability should be low.

4. **P(H for each field):** We can assume that graduate students in any one field (among the three provided) are equally likely given no other context, hence the prior probabilities can initially be taken as equal.

5. **P(E):** This is a normalization factor and for our case scenario, it can be considered across all fields.

Using these assumptions, we can assemble the probabilities qualitatively for each field as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // Moderate fit due to high intelligence and abstract thinking
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // Strong fit due to love for animals and nature
  "business administration": 0.1  // Low fit due to less alignment with business traits
}
```
Note: This is a qualitative assessment using reasonable assumptions based on given traits. For precise calculations, exact prior probabilities and likelihoods would be needed.
