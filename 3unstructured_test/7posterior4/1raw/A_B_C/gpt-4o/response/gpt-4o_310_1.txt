To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we'll rely on the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Note that \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant, which ensures the probabilities sum to 1 across the fields considered. However, since we are not given exact values for \(P(H)\), \(P(E|H)\), and \(P(E)\), we'll make informed estimates based on the given personality sketch for qualitative analysis.

1. **Business Administration**:
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}})\): The characteristic traits of Adam (love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciation for hard work) don't strongly align with typical attributes of business administration students.
    - Estimate: Low probability.

2. **Computer Science**:
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}})\): Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles, intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align reasonably well with qualities of computer science students. However, love for nature and animals does not strongly fit.
    - Estimate: Moderate probability.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - \(P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}})\): Adam's strong empathy, deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align very well with this field.
    - Estimate: High probability.

Assuming equal prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field for simplicity, and focusing on \(P(E|H)\), we can express our estimates as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values indicate our qualitative confidence based on the given personality sketch. For exact probabilities, specific statistical data about student interests and field distributions would be needed.
