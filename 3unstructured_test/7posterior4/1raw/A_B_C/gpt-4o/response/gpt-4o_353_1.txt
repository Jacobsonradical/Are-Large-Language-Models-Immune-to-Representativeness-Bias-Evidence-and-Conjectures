To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (field of study) given the evidence (personality sketch E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence's marginal likelihood.

Given the nature of the question, which is qualitative, we can use intuitive guesses based on the description provided.

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with traits beneficial for computer science.
   - However, nothing in the sketch suggests a strong affinity with technology or programming, which are central to computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business administration typically involves a lot of interaction with people, strategic thinking, and leadership, which arenâ€™t strongly highlighted in Adam's personality.
   - The love for nature, animals, and empathy don't strongly align with typical business administration traits.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.
   - His appreciation for hard work and dedication also fits well with this field's requirements.

Let's assign some heuristic probabilities. Note that these values are not computed from actual data but are reasoned estimates based on the given sketch.

- **P(E|H)**: 
  - Computer Science: 0.2 (Adam's problem-solving and abstract thinking are good fits but lack of expressed interest in tech is a gap)
  - Business Administration: 0.1 (Mismatch with most described traits)
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.7 (Strong alignment with nature, animals, and empathy)
  
- **P(H)**:
  - Assuming a rough equal distribution but giving higher probability to less common and highly specialized fields like Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - Computer Science: 0.3
  - Business Administration: 0.3
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.4

- **P(E)**: Normalizing constant which ensures the total probability sums up across all fields. It's challenging to estimate exact values without detailed data, but it's the sum of all \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

  \[ P(E) = (P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})) + (P(E|H_{ba}) \cdot P(H_{ba})) + (P(E|H_{avs}) \cdot P(H_{avs})) \]
  
  \[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.7 \cdot 0.4) = 0.06 + 0.03 + 0.28 = 0.37 \]

Now, calculating the posterior probabilities:

- **Computer Science:**
  \[ P(H_{cs}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.3}{0.37} \approx 0.162 \]

- **Business Administration:**
  \[ P(H_{ba}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.37} \approx 0.081 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  \[ P(H_{avs}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.4}{0.37} \approx 0.757 \]

Hence, the estimated posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.162,
  "business administration": 0.081,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.757
}
