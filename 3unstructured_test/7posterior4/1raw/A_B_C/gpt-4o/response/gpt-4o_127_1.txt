To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Unfortunately, we are not provided with the specific numeric values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), or the overall evidence \( P(E) \). However, based on the description, we can qualitatively assess the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) and make reasonable inferences about the prior probabilities for Adam's enrollment in each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high. 
   - If we assume prior probabilities are somewhat uniform but slightly favor based on personality traits, then \( P(H) \) might be higher for AVS due to alignment with Adam's interests.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - Adam's traits don't particularly align with this field. While his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could contribute to success here, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is lower compared to AVS.
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) might be somewhat lower for BA given the lack of traits directly tied to business.

3. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. These qualities align well with CS.
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) for CS could be moderate to high, considering analytical skills and problem-solving interest.

Given these qualitative arguments:
- \( P(E|H) \) is high for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- \( P(E|H) \) is lower for Business Administration.
- \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to high for Computer Science.

Assuming fairly uniform but rationally adjusted prior probabilities and normalizing qualitative insights, we can then provide rough qualitative posterior values.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Please note that these values are qualitative and rely on the given personality sketch aligned with intuitive matchings of fields rather than precise numeric data.
