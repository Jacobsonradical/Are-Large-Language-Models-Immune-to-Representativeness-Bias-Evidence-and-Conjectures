To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probability of each hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given we do not have specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll have to make educated estimates based on common perceptions and the given personality sketch. 

For each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Priors: High for graduate students (computer science is a common graduate field).
   - Likelihood given the evidence: Moderate to low. Adam’s profile suggests curiosity towards nature, empathy, and a love for animals, which doesn't directly align with typical computer science traits.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Priors: Moderate for graduate students (business administration is also a common graduate field).
   - Likelihood given the evidence: Low. The profile of Adam does not indicate a strong fit for business, as empathy and love for animals are less central to business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Priors: Lower compared to computer science and business administration.
   - Likelihood given the evidence: High. Adam’s love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.

Based on these considerations:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
```

These values are rough estimates indicating the relative likelihoods based on the given personality sketch of Adam and common stereotypes of each field.
