To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we must evaluate how the personality traits and interests of Adam align with each field of study. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

**Assumptions and Reasoning:**

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals strongly align with this field. His empathy and warm heart are also conducive to veterinary science where animal care is critical.
2. **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts are relevant to computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also points towards this field.
3. **Business Administration**: The traits described don't strongly suggest an alignment with business administration. Empathy and understanding hard work are relevant, but specific interest and skills related to business are not indicated.

We will use a qualitative approach to estimate the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These are estimates meant to capture the likelihood of each field based on the provided personality sketch.
