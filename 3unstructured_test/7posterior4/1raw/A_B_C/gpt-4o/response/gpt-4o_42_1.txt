To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

To assign probabilities for \( P(E|H) \), we can qualitatively reason based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's interests in nature, animals, and solving puzzles do not strongly align with a business administration background.
   - However, there might be some overlap if business administration includes fields like environmental management or a focus on sustainability.
   - We hypothesize a low probability.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and a strong understanding of abstract concepts, aligning well with computer science.
   - His empathy and love for animals might also suggest potential interest in fields like computational biology.
   - We hypothesize a moderately high probability.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.4 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which fits well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - He has a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication, which aligns with the demands of these fields.
   - We hypothesize a high probability.

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.8 \]

For the priors \( P(H) \), we lack concrete data, so we'll assume an equal probability among fields for simplicity:

\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given our equal priors and estimates of \( P(E|H) \):

\[ P(E) \] is derived from the sum of the products of each \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(E) \approx P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) \approx 0.1 \cdot 0.333 + 0.4 \cdot 0.333 + 0.8 \cdot 0.333 \approx 0.033 + 0.133 + 0.267 \approx 0.433 \]

Now, we compute the posterior probabilities:

\[
P(H|E_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.433} \approx \frac{0.033}{0.433} \approx 0.076
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.433} \approx \frac{0.133}{0.433} \approx 0.307
\]

\[
P(H|E_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.433} \approx \frac{0.267}{0.433} \approx 0.616
\]
