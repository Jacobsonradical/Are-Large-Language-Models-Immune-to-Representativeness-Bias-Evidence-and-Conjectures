Bayes' rule formalizes the process of updating beliefs given new evidence. The general form of Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
  - \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
  - \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
  - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
  - \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

To compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to estimate \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). For simplicity, let's assume roughly equal priors for each field, as we lack specific prior probabilities. We assume all hypotheses are equally likely initially (\( P(H) \) is the same for each field).

Given the information in E:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity for nature and plants.
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
- Adam has a strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals.
- Adam has high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts.
- Adam appreciates hard work and dedication.

Based on this information, \( P(E|H) \):
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \) might be moderate because computer science requires problem-solving and intelligence but less focus on plants and animals.
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) is likely high because this field aligns well with his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \) might be low because although it requires intelligence and dedication, it doesn't specifically align with his interest in nature, plants, or animals.

Assuming \( P(H) \) is equal for all fields, let's estimate:

\[ P(E|\text{computer science}) \approx 0.3 \]
\[ P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|\text{business administration}) \approx 0.2 \]

\( P(E) \) is a normalization factor for making sure the probabilities sum up to 1 for all possible hypotheses. However, since we are not required to sum up the total across all possible fields, we can focus on the relative likelihoods directly.

Given the above likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \times P(H) \]

Since \( P(H) \) is equal (normalized out):

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.3 \times C,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 \times C,
  "business administration": 0.2 \times C
}
\]

To make these values straightforward as relative, we can drop the constant factor C:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
\]

Thus, the results are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```
