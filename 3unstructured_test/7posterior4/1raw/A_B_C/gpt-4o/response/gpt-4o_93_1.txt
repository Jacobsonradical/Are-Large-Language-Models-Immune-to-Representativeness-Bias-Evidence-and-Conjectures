To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll use the following formulation:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since I do not have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I will qualitatively estimate these probabilities based on the information given in Adam's personality sketch. 

### Assumptions:
1. \( P(H) \) (Prior probability of each field): We assume that each field has an equal prior probability for a given graduate student, though in reality, this may differ.
2. \( P(E|H) \) (Likelihood of observing the personality sketch given each field): This will be based on the match between Adam's personality and the typical attributes needed for each field.

### Qualitative Estimations:
- For **business administration**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) would be lower due to less emphasis on nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts.
  - Assumption: \( \text{Moderate to Low Fit} \)
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) would be higher since there is a strong match for curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and hard work.
  - Assumption: \( \text{High Fit} \)
- For **computer science**:
  - \( P(E|H) \) would be moderate because of the fit with problem-solving, intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts, though less emphasis on nature and animals.
  - Assumption: \( \text{Moderate Fit} \)

### Probabilities:
Based on the qualitative analysis, let's assign approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's interests and traits are most aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science and then business administration. The actual probabilities could differ with more data or context on the base rates (\( P(H) \)) and likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)).
