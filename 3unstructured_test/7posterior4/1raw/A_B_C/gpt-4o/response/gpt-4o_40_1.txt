To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given he is in each field. However, without specific numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we can only provide a qualitative assessment. 

Given Adam's personality traits and interests, we can make educated guesses:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals. These traits align well with this field.
   - Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in this field given his personality sketch is relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam seems to have a warm heart and strong empathy, which could be beneficial in business administration. However, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are less relevant to this field.
   - Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in this field given his personality sketch is relatively low.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence, making him a strong fit for computer science. However, his interests in nature and animals are less directly relevant to this field.
   - Therefore, the likelihood of Adam being in this field given his personality sketch is moderate.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can assign approximate probabilities.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods of Adam being in each field based on the given personality sketch and his interests and strengths.
