To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider several components:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The initial probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in a specific field \( H \).
3. **Normalization Constant \( P(E) \)**: The total probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Since exact numbers for priors and likelihoods are not provided, I will make reasonable estimates based on the typical attributes associated with each field and how well they match Adam's personality sketch.

### Estimates:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**:
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: It is not one of the most common graduate fields, so let's assign \( P(H_1) \) a moderate value.
   - Business Administration: This is a very common field, so let's assign \( P(H_2) \) a higher value.
   - Computer Science: Also a common and popular field, \( P(H_3) \) will be similarly high to Business Administration.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: Based on the personality sketch
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Very high match due to Adam's love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - **Business Administration**: Low match given Adam's described personality traits which are more aligned with hands-on and research-oriented fields rather than business and administrative work.
   - **Computer Science**: Moderate match because of Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving skills, though not explicitly mentioned, it’s plausible.

### Assigning Values:
- Prior (\( P(H) \)):  
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.2  
  - Business Administration: 0.3  
  - Computer Science: 0.3  

- Likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)):  
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.9  
  - Business Administration: 0.2  
  - Computer Science: 0.6  

### Posterior Calculation:
- For simplicity and without normalization constants (since we’re interested in just the relative scales):

\[
P(H_1|E) \propto P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) = 0.9 \times 0.2 = 0.18
\]
\[
P(H_2|E) \propto P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06
\]
\[
P(H_3|E) \propto P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) = 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18
\]

### Normalizing:
To find the normalized probabilities, we sum the unnormalized values and divide each by the sum:

\[
\sum = 0.18 + 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.42
\]

\[
\frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.428
\]
\[
\frac{0.06}{0.42} \approx 0.143
\]
\[
\frac{0.18}{0.42} \approx 0.428
\]

### Final Probabilities:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.428,
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.428
}
```
