To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study given Adam's personality sketch (E), we need to apply Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being in field H given evidence E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence E given field H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of field H.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant (total probability of evidence E).

To proceed with Bayesian reasoning:
1. We need to make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).
2. We need to consider general prior probabilities for each field \( P(H) \).
3. Although we won't compute the exact values (due to missing general graduate field demographic data), we will reason qualitatively based on Adam's traits.

Given Adam’s personality sketch, let's estimate the following:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
   - **P(E|H):** High. Adam’s love for nature, animals, and plants fits well in this field.
   - **P(H):** Reasonably moderate, as this field is less common relative to some others.
   - **P(E):** This term is the same for all fields and will generally be incorporated into normalization.

2. Computer Science:
   - **P(E|H):** Moderate. Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills align with computer science, but the nature and animals interest is less directly relevant.
   - **P(H):** High, as computer science is a very common graduate field with many students.
   - **P(E):** Same for normalization.

3. Business Administration:
   - **P(E|H):** Low. Adam’s traits do not align well with typical business administration student traits.
   - **P(H):** High, as it is a very common graduate field.
   - **P(E):** Same for normalization.

Let's make qualitative assessments based on the above reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the higher and lower likelihoods based on Adam's traits. Note that precise numeric values would require actual data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, but these are reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch.
