Given Adam's personality sketch E, we need to compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) for each of the fields using Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we will make educated estimates based on the given description of Adam's personality and interests. 

We can assume the following:
- Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be relevant in all fields.
- His strong curiosity about nature and animals leans more towards agricultural and veterinary science.
- His enjoyment in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suggests some compatibility with computer science.
- His empathy, warm heart, and love for animals seem less aligned with business administration.

Let's qualitatively reason about the possible values:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, as his qualities donâ€™t strongly align with typical characteristics needed in business administration.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, since business administration is a common graduate field but not evidently supported by Adam's traits.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as his skills in solving puzzles and abstract concepts could fit well here.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, given the popularity of the field and the demand for high intelligence in this area.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, given his deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, as this field is specialized but matches Adam's interests well.

Given these considerations, we can assign the following probabilities (these are qualitative estimates):

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Please note that these values are derived based on the qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality might fit into each field and should ideally be supplemented with more precise data for accurate computation.
