To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of the personality traits given each field and the general prevalence of students in each field. However, without specific numerical data on those aspects, we can make qualitative guesses based on the given information.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \).

For this qualitative estimation:
- "computer science": Given Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, this would seem possible. However, the deep love for nature and animals might not align as closely.
- "business administration": This field seems less correlated with Adam’s strong empathy towards animals and nature.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.

Based on these judgments:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \): moderate
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \): low
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \): high

Assuming each field is equally probable a priori, we can qualitatively assign higher posterior probabilities to more likely fields and lower ones to less likely fields.

So, the qualitative estimates might look like this:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These are qualitative estimates and should be computed more rigorously with actual likelihood and prior data for precise results.
