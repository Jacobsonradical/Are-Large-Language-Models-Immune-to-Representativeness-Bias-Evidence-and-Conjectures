To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's break it down step by step for each field. Given we do not have exact values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), we will have to make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch and the nature of each field.

### Assumptions
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively high, as computer science is a common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, because the puzzle-solving ability and high intelligence fit well, but the love for nature and animals is less common in this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively high, as business administration is also a common graduate field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, because traits like curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less directly relevant.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, less common than the previous two but still significant.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Very high, as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work match well.

### Hypothetical Estimations
Since exact numerical values for priors and likelihoods are not given, we make a relative comparison and assume proportional likelihood values based on fit from the description:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.3 \) (Traits partially fit)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (Relative popularity)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Traits minimally fit)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \) (Relative popularity)

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (Traits strongly fit)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \) (Less common)

Now let's normalize these to sum to 1, assuming we only consider these three fields for simplicity:

### Posterior Computation

- **Computer Science**:
  - Numerator: \( 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \)

- **Business Administration**:
  - Numerator: \( 0.1 \times 0.2 = 0.02 \)

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - Numerator: \( 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \)

### Normalized Posterior Probabilities

\[ \text{Total} = 0.06 + 0.02 + 0.08 = 0.16 \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.06}{0.16} \approx 0.375 \]

\[ P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.02}{0.16} \approx 0.125 \]

\[ P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.16} \approx 0.5 \]

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.375,
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

These probabilities indicate that given the personality sketch, Adam is most likely to be enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, followed by Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
