To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field, we need to understand and apply Bayes' rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for prior probabilities \(P(H)\) (the probability that Adam is enrolled in each field), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) (how likely Adam's personality traits are given each field), or the evidence \(P(E)\) (the overall probability of Adam having those personality traits), we can only make qualitative assessments based on the provided information. 

Based on Adam's personality traits:
1. A genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. A quiet demeanor and enjoyment in solving puzzles.
3. Warm-hearted with strong empathy and a love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Let's assess \(P(E|H)\) for each field qualitatively:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given the strong connection between Adam’s traits (curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, empathy) and the characteristics desirable in this field, \(P(E|H)\) is high.

2. **Business Administration**: While high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are relevant, Adam’s personality traits such as empathy, love for nature and animals, and quiet demeanor might be less directly connected compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Thus, \(P(E|H)\) is relatively lower.

3. **Computer Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's enjoyment in solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding abstract concepts. However, the direct connection to his love for nature and animals is less clear, so \(P(E|H)\) is moderately high but not as high as Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Let's represent these qualitative assessments in the form of posterior probabilities in each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are qualitatively assessed with:
- High compatibility for Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
- Low compatibility for Business Administration.
- Moderate compatibility for Computer Science.
