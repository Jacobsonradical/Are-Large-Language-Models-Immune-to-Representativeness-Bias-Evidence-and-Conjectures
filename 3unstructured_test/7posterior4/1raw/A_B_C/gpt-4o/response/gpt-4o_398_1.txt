To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for the priors \(P(H)\) and the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), we can only provide qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch.

Given Adam's described characteristics (curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, empathy, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work), we qualitatively assess how well these traits fit each of the mentioned fields of study. Here’s a reasoned approach considering Adam's personality sketch \(E\):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam’s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science})\) is high.

2. **Computer Science**: 
   - His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with the analytical and problem-solving nature of computer science.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{computer \, science})\) is moderate.

3. **Business Administration**: 
   - While Adam’s appreciation for hard work and his intelligence are relevant, his specific interest in nature and animals is less directly related.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{business \, administration})\) is lower.

Given these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Please note that these values are meant to illustrate the relative likelihoods based on the available information and are not derived from precise data. In a more detailed analysis, specific prior probabilities and likelihoods would be considered for each field.
