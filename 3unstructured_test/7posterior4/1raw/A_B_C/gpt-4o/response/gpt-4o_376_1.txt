To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each hypothesis. This is the initial probability of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch.
- The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, which can be found using:
\[ P(E) = \sum_{k} P(E|H_k) \cdot P(H_k) \]

Since we don't have exact values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we will use a qualitative approach to estimate these based on the personality sketch provided.

Here are the personality traits and their alignment with each field:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals — highly relevant.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart — highly relevant for dealing with living beings.
   - High intelligence, abstract thinking — useful in scientific research in this field.

2. **Business administration**:
   - Curiosity about plants and animals — not typically relevant.
   - Strong empathy could be beneficial in management, but not a definitive indicator.
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking — useful, but other traits are less aligned.

3. **Computer science**:
   - Interest in solving puzzles — relevant for problem-solving in this field.
   - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts — very relevant.
   - Traits related to nature and animals — not very relevant.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can make an informed guess about the relative likelihoods and priors:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These probabilities reflect the qualitative assessment that Adam's personality traits are most aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, somewhat aligned with computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence, and least aligned with business administration.
