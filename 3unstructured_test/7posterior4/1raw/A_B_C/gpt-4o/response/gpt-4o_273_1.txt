To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the formula: 

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where: 
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \).

However, without specific priors \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) or enough context to precisely quantify these, the calculation would be purely speculative. 

Instead, I can provide a qualitative assessment based on the attributes given in Adam's personality sketch and how they align with each field of study:

- **Computer Science**: While Adam is described as intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, there's no direct mention of a passion for technology, programming, or problem-solving specifically related to computer science.

- **Business Administration**: Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business administration. However, there's no direct evidence suggesting an interest in business, finance, or management.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. These attributes align closely with the skills and interests necessary for agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, here is a tentative posterior probability distribution:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the respective fields, assuming equal prior probabilities in the absence of more specific information.
