To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field as a graduate student.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

Given the descriptive nature, we need to make educated estimations for these probabilities since exact values aren't provided. Let's assume:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Individuals in computer science may also exhibit curiosity about abstract concepts and enjoy solving puzzles, making it likely Adam is in this field.
   - Let's denote \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.6 \).
   - Assuming prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \) is relatively high because many graduate students are in this field, let's take \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.3 \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - This field might have less connection with curiosity about nature/plants/animals but may still have people who appreciate hard work and dedication.
   - Let's denote \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).
   - Assuming a lower prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \), around \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field strongly aligns with Adam's personality sketch, as it directly involves nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
   - Let's denote \( P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) \approx 0.8 \).
   - Assuming a smaller but still significant prior \( P(H_{\text{AGV}}) \), we're going with \( P(H_{\text{AGV}}) \approx 0.1 \).

We calculate \( P(E) \) as a normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AGV}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.6 \cdot 0.3) + (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.1) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.18 + 0.04 + 0.08 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \]

Now, applying Bayesâ€™ rule:

1. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = 0.6 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.04}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = 0.133 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AGV}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AGV}})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AGV}}|E) = 0.267 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.60,
  "business administration": 0.133,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267
}
```
