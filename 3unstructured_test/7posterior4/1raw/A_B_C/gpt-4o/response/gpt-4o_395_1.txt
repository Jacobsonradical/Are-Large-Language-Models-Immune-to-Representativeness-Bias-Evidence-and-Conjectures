To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to evaluate the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \), the prior probabilities of each hypothesis, and the overall likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Bayes' rule is stated as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have the exact values for priors and likelihoods, I will provide a conceptual approximation based on the information given in the personality sketch of Adam and typical characteristics of these fields.

### Reasoning:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which directly aligns with the interests and focus of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - The traits of empathy and a warm heart are beneficial in veterinary science.
   \[ P(E|H_{AVS}) \] should be high.
   
2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam's enjoyment of solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts is a good fit for computer science.
   - However, thereâ€™s less emphasis on nature and animals, which are central to his interests.
   \[ P(E|H_{CS}) \] should be moderate.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - While high intelligence and abstract thinking can be advantageous in business, there is little in the personality sketch that directly points to a strong alignment with business administration.
   \[ P(E|H_{BA}) \] should be low.

Given these considerations, we can conceptually approximate:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(E|H_{AVS}) & \approx 0.7 \\
P(E|H_{CS}) & \approx 0.2 \\
P(E|H_{BA}) & \approx 0.1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Posterior Probabilities:

Without exact values for priors, we assume a simplistic equal prior distribution for each field for conceptual purposes:

\[
P(H_{AVS}) = P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

For simplicity in this context, let's assume \( P(E) \) is normalized such that we focus on relative likelihoods.

### Approximate Results:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

This provides a relative ranking reflecting the likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch.
