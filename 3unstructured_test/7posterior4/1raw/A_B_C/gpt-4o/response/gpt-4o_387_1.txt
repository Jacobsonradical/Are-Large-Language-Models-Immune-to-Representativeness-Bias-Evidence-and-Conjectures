To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have the following information or make reasonable assumptions about the distribution of each field as well as the likelihood of Adam's traits given the specific field. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To produce an approximate answer, we will make reasonable assumptions about the probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and common attributes associated with each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and a strong understanding of hard work and dedication.
    - These traits are a very strong match to agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Adam's personality traits such as intelligence and empathy can be valuable in business, but the description doesn't align strongly with the typical subject matter of business administration (e.g., management, finance).

3. **Computer Science**:
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is of high intelligence, which are indicative traits for computer science.
    - However, there's no direct mention of an interest in technology or programming.

Based on these considerations, let's make reasonable assumptions for the likelihoods and prior probabilities. Without specific empirical data, these values can only be estimated.

Assumptions:
- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \) are assumed to be roughly equal for simplicity, say 1/10 each, given many potential fields.
- Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) will differ based on the match of Adam's traits to each field.

Estimates:
- For \( P(E|H_{\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}}) \):
    - Strong match, estimate: 0.7
- For \( P(E|H_{\text{Business Administration}}) \):
    - Weak match, estimate: 0.1
- For \( P(E|H_{\text{Computer Science}}) \):
    - Moderate match, estimate: 0.3

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all fields, it will cancel out in our comparisons, and we don't need to calculate it for relative probabilities.

Normalized Values (approximations):
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.7}{0.7+0.1+0.3} \approx 0.636 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.1}{0.7+0.1+0.3} \approx 0.091 \)
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.3}{0.7+0.1+0.3} \approx 0.273 \)

Here's the output in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.636,
  "business administration": 0.091,
  "computer science": 0.273
