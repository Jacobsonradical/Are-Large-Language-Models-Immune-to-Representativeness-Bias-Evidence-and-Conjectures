To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to know or assume the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since we don't have specific prior probabilities, we will assume them to be equal for simplicity. However, we can qualitatively estimate the likelihoods based on the personality sketch provided.

**Bayesâ€™ Rule:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will assess how likely the personality sketch \( E \) is given each hypothesis \( H \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{agricultural\_vet}) \):
      - High, because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which fits well with this field.
      - Let's approximate it as 0.7 for simplicity.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{business\_admin}) \):
      - Lower, because there is no specific mention of interest or traits particularly aligned with business administration. His profile seems more aligned with science-related fields.
      - Let's approximate it as 0.1.

3. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E | H_{computer\_science}) \):
      - Moderate to high, because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which often aligns with the skills needed in computer science.
      - Let's approximate it as 0.5.

Assuming equal prior probabilities \( P(H_{agricultural\_vet}) = P(H_{business\_admin}) = P(H_{computer\_science}) \), we can denote the priors as \( P(H) = \frac{1}{3} \) for each.

Given equal priors, the simplified posterior probabilities become proportional to the likelihoods:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)
\]

Thus, our proportional estimates are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \approx \frac{0.7}{0.7 + 0.1 + 0.5} = \frac{0.7}{1.3} \approx 0.5385 \),
  "business administration": \( \approx \frac{0.1}{0.7 + 0.1 + 0.5} = \frac{0.1}{1.3} \approx 0.0769 \),
  "computer science": \( \approx \frac{0.5}{0.7 + 0.1 + 0.5} = \frac{0.5}{1.3} \approx 0.3846 \)
}

So, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5385,
  "business administration": 0.0769,
  "computer science": 0.3846
}
```
