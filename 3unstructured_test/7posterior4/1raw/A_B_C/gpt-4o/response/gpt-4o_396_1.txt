To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given the field \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the field \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Our goal is to provide a qualitative estimate of these probabilities.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, as these fields are less commonly selected compared to business-related programs.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, since Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, and his empathy align well with this field.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high, as computer science is a popular and growing field.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, since Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align with computer science, although his interest in nature and animals doesn't directly relate.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: High, as business administration is one of the most popular graduate fields.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low, since Adam's interests and personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration coursework.
