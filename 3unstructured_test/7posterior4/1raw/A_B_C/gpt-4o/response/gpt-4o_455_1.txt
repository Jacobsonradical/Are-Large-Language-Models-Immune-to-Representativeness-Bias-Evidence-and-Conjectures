To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to know:

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \): The probability of the evidence.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we can make educated guesses based on the nature of Adam's interests and characteristics. Here are the steps and rough estimations:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Given Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he fits the profile of a computer science student, but his strong interest in nature and animals doesn't directly align.
   - **P(H)**: Computer Science is a popular field in graduate studies, so the prior probability is moderate to high.
   - **P(E)**: This will be constant across all fields and can be considered when normalizing across fields, but here we focus on individual comparisons.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: While intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can apply, Adam's interests in nature, animals, and empathy seem less relevant to business administration.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is also a common field of study, so the prior probability is moderate.
  
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam's strong curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals directly align with this field.
   - **P(H)**: This field is less common than computer science or business administration, but Adam's personality sketch strongly aligns with it.

Based on the above qualitative assessment, we'll assign rough probabilities:

\[ \text{P(E|Computer Science)} \approx 0.3 \]
\[ \text{P(H|Computer Science)} \approx 0.4 \]

\[ \text{P(E|Business Administration)} \approx 0.2 \]
\[ \text{P(H|Business Administration)} \approx 0.2 \]

\[ \text{P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} \approx 0.8 \]
\[ \text{P(H|Agricultural and Veterinary Science)} \approx 0.1 \]

Calculating posterior probabilities using qualitative scores:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.3 \times 0.4 = 0.12 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H|E) \approx 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]

Therefore:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.12,
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08
}
```

These values provide an illustrative example based on qualitative assessment and should not be considered precise without real data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
