To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H \mid E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in the absence of concrete numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E \mid H) \), we can use qualitative reasoning to approximate these probabilities based on the provided information. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts, both of which are important traits in computer science.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of an interest in technology or coding.
   - Thus, the probability is not extremely high but reasonable.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart.
   - These characteristics align closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Therefore, the probability is relatively high.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - The personality sketch does not indicate traits that are particularly characteristic of business administration, such as an interest in economics, management, or entrepreneurship.
   - As a result, the probability is likely lower.

Using these qualitative assessments, we assign reasonable values between 0 and 1 for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the likelihood of each field being Adam's area of study based on his personality traits and interests as described.
