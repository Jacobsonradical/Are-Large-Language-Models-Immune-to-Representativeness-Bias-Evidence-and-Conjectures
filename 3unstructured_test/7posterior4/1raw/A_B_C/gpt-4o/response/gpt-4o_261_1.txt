To compute the posterior conditional probabilities P(H|E) for each field given Adam's personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we will follow these steps:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: We need reasonable estimates of the prior probabilities for each field. These can be based on general enrollment statistics in graduate programs in the U.S.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: This is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a specific field. This will be based on how well his personality traits match the typical traits of students in the respective fields.
3. **Normalization**: While this usually involves calculating P(E) to ensure the posterior probabilities sum to 1, for this purpose, we will evaluate each field independently. 

Let's assume approximate prior probabilities based on enrollment statistics or common distribution:
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.1 (P(H_agricultural))
- Computer Science: 0.3 (P(H_computer))
- Business Administration: 0.2 (P(H_business))

Now, let's consider the likelihoods (P(E|H)) for each field based on Adam's personality.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Likelihood is high due to his love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work. Let's say 0.9.
- Computer Science: Likelihood is moderate. His interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence is a good fit, though other traits might be less aligned. Let's estimate 0.6.
- Business Administration: Likelihood is lower but not negligible. Business programs value dedication and intelligence, but the fit with empathy and love for nature/animals is lower. Let's say 0.3.

Using Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we will not compute P(E) explicitly and are focusing on relative values, we simply consider:

\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) P(H) \]

Calculations:

1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
\[ P(H_agricultural|E) \propto 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \]

2. Computer Science:
\[ P(H_computer|E) \propto 0.6 \times 0.3 = 0.18 \]

3. Business Administration:
\[ P(H_business|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \]

Finally, normalizing these:

- \( P(H_agricultural|E) \approx \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18 + 0.06} = \frac{0.09}{0.33} \approx 0.27 \)
- \( P(H_computer|E) \approx \frac{0.18}{0.33} \approx 0.55 \)
- \( P(H_business|E) \approx \frac{0.06}{0.33} \approx 0.18 \)

These are relative probabilities and do not need to sum to 1 as we have other fields possible.
