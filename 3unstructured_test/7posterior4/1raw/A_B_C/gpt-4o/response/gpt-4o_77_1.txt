To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality traits (E) given that Adam was in a particular field (H).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality traits (E).

While it's challenging to assign precise numerical values without concrete statistical data, we can make educated estimates based on general knowledge and assumptions. Here, the focus is on comparing the relative likelihoods of different fields given Adam's described personality.

**Assumptions:**
- \( P(H) \) might differ for each field based on how common it is among graduate students.
- \( P(E|H) \) varies based on how well Adam's personality traits align with typical characteristics associated with those fields.
- Without specific data, \( P(E) \) can be considered a normalization factor that does not affect the relative comparison.

**Estimations:**

1. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - Generally, BA students might be expected to have strong social and leadership skills. Adam's quiet and empathetic nature, along with his curiosity about nature, makes it less likely.
   - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \): Moderate.
   
   Result: Lower probability.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
   - Strong alignment with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): High.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Moderate to High.
   
   Result: Higher probability.

3. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - Solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts are highly aligned with typical traits for CS.
   - Nature curiosity and love for animals are less directly related, but not exclusive of CS interests.
   - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \): High.
   
   Result: Moderate to High probability.

Given these qualitative assessments, we assign approximate values based on relative likelihoods:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Note that these values are estimations and the actual values could differ based on more detailed empirical data and statistical analysis.
