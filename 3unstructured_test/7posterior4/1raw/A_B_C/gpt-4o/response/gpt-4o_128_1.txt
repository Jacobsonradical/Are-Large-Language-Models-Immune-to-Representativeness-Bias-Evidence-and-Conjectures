To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in that specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch overall.

We need some estimates or assumptions for each of these probabilities:
1. \( P(H) \) can be considered approximately equal for simplicity since we donâ€™t have specific data.
2. \( P(E) \) remains constant across different hypotheses.
3. \( P(E|H) \) needs to be estimated based on how well the personality sketch fits each field.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - High \( P(E|H) \) due to Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy.

- Computer Science:
  - Moderate to high \( P(E|H) \), as analytical skills, solving puzzles, and high intelligence fit this field.

- Business Administration:
  - Lower \( P(E|H) \). While intelligence is important, interest in nature and empathy do not align closely with typical business administration traits.

For the sake of relative comparison:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary}}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.2 \]

Assuming \( P(H) \) is equal across fields for simplicity (\( \frac{1}{N} \)), and considering \( P(E) \) is constant, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to \( P(E|H) \).

Thus, the relative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```
