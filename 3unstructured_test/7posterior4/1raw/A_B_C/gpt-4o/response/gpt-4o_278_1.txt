To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each specified field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to assign reasonable values for the likelihoods and priors. However, without concrete data, we'll make educated estimates based on typical characteristics of the fields and Adam's personality sketch.

Let's break it down:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): The description does not strongly align with typical traits for Business Administration. Likelihood will be low.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): A moderate proportion of graduate students are in Business Administration. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Strong alignment with Adam's interests in nature, plants, and animals. High likelihood.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): A smaller proportion of graduate students are in this field compared to Business Administration or Computer Science.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Moderate match due to his interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, but less so due to his focus on nature and animals.
   - Prior \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): A large proportion of graduate students are in Computer Science.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions about the proportions:
- \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \)

And let's estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.4 \)

Finally, the marginal probability \( P(E) \) can be ignored for comparison purposes since it is constant.

Using the above estimates, we get:

\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{AgVet}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}})P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) = 0.8 \times 0.1 = 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16 \]

These values need to be normalized (they should sum up to 1, but within the context of our answer, they don't need to):

Normalize them by dividing by the sum \( (0.03 + 0.08 + 0.16) = 0.27 \):

\[ \frac{0.03}{0.27} = \approx 0.111 \]
\[ \frac{0.08}{0.27} = \approx 0.296 \]
\[ \frac{0.16}{0.27} = \approx 0.593 \]

Thus, the resulting probabilities are approximately:

{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.593
}
