To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality traits described given that he is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam having the personality traits described across all fields.

Given that we don't have specific numerical data for these probabilities, we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate them. Here are my reasoning-based estimates:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderately likely since business programs are common.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, because people in business administration are often more extroverted and less focused on nature and animals.
   - My qualitative assessment leads me to believe \( P(H|E) \) should be lower than the other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Less common than business, but given Adam's interests.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, due to his love for nature, empathy, and interest in animals.
   - My qualitative assessment leads me to believe \( P(H|E) \) should be quite high.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(H) \): Moderately likely, as many students choose computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, since solving puzzles and abstract thinking align well, but nature and animals less so.
   - My qualitative assessment leads me to believe \( P(H|E) \) should be moderate to high.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.10,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.20
}
```

These values are reflective of the match between the field and Adam's personality sketch, leveraging both the probablity of enrollment and how his traits align with each field.
