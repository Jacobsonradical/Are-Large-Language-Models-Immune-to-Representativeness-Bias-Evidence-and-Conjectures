To compute the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Bayes' rule can be written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch \(E\) of Adam.

Given the information, let's intuitively estimate the likelihoods and priors for each of the fields as follows:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Prior \(P(H)\): Moderate, as computer science is a popular field.
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, traits that fit well with computer science, but his deep love for nature and animals is less related.
    - Estimated Probability: Moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Prior \(P(H)\): Lower compared to computer science due to fewer students generally.
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Very high, given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong appreciation for hard work in a related field.
    - Estimated Probability: High.

3. **Business Administration**:
    - Prior \(P(H)\): Moderate to high, as business administration is also a common field.
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Lower, because the given personality traits do not specifically align well with typical traits associated with business administration students.
    - Estimated Probability: Low to moderate.

Considering these qualitative assessments, here is a possible estimation of the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Note: These values are qualitative estimates based on the narrative provided, and actual posterior probabilities would require specific numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods.
