To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields in question, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a given field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch across all fields.

Since we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we must rely on qualitative assessments for \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \). We can make educated guesses based on the information provided in the personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is likely high because Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with this field.
   - \( P(H) \) would be moderate to low based on the general distribution of students in graduate programs, although it might be higher for someone with Adam's profile.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) might be moderate because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, which are valuable traits for computer science.
   - \( P(H) \) would be relatively high due to the popularity and wide availability of computer science programs among graduate students.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is likely low because Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration, such as an interest in commerce, leadership, and organizational skills.
   - \( P(H) \) might be moderate based on the general popularity of business administration programs.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some rough probabilities. These values are not precise but are intended to provide a reasonable estimate based on the available information.

\[
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.35,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
}
\]

These values reflect the increased likelihood that Adam's personality sketch aligns with agricultural and veterinary science, followed by a reasonable fit with computer science, and a less likely fit with business administration.
