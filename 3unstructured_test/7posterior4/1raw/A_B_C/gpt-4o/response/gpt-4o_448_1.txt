To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we'll follow this formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given the personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam was enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having the personality sketch \( E \), considering all possible fields.

Since we are not provided with specific prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll make educated subjective estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Let's hypothesize the likelihoods and provide the posterior probabilities:

- **Business Administration**: The given personality traits (interest in nature, empathy, love for animals) seem less typical for this field.
- **Computer Science**: The traits (high intelligence, puzzle solving, abstract thinking) align well with this field but may lack the specific emphasis on nature and animals.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The interest in nature and animals is a strong indicator for this field.

Based on these considerations:

1. Assign likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

    - **Business Administration**: \( P(E|BA) \approx 0.1 \)
    - **Computer Science**: \( P(E|CS) \approx 0.5 \)
    - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(E|AVS) \approx 0.9 \)

2. Assign the prior probabilities \( P(H) \):

    - These are subjective, but let's assume:
    - \( P(BA) \approx 0.3 \)
    - \( P(CS) \approx 0.4 \)
    - \( P(AVS) \approx 0.3 \)

3. Compute the total probability \( P(E) \):

    - \( P(E) = P(E|BA) \cdot P(BA) + P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|AVS) \cdot P(AVS) \)
    - \( P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.5 \cdot 0.4) + (0.9 \cdot 0.3) \)
    - \( P(E) = 0.03 + 0.2 + 0.27 \)
    - \( P(E) = 0.5 \)

4. Apply Bayes' rule:

{
  "business administration": \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = 0.06 \),
  "computer science": \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.4}{0.5} = 0.4 \),
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.3}{0.5} = 0.54 \)
}

So the final probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.06",
  "computer science": "0.4",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.54"
}
