To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the overall likelihood of Adam being in each field given his personality traits, as well as the prior probability of each field among graduate students. For simplicity, let's assume the priors for each field are equal, although in practice this may not be true. 

Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

For simplicity, we'll assume equal priors:
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}) = P(H_{\text{ba}}) = P(H_{\text{avs}}) \approx \frac{1}{3} \]

Now we focus on \( P(E|H) \), the likelihood of Adam's characteristics given each field. 

Given the description (E):
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and plants: Higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science.
2. Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles: More neutral, could apply to CS or AVS.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, deep love for animals: Very high for AVS.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts: Highly relevant to CS, moderately to AVS.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work: Neutral, but valued in most fields.

Let's assign assumed likelihoods for each characteristic mapping to each field:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \approx 0.4 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \approx 0.8 \)

Normalize these values to convert them into proper posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{\sum_{H} P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.4}{1.4} \approx 0.29 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{\sum_{H} P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.2}{1.4} \approx 0.14 \]

\[ P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{avs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{avs}})}{\sum_{H} P(E|H) \cdot P(H)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{1.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{0.8}{1.4} \approx 0.57 \]

Hence, the computed posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.29,
  "business administration": 0.14,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.57
}
