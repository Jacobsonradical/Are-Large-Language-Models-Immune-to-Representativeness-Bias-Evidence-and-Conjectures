To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to specify the components required: 

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: The initial probability of Adam being in each field before considering the personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: The probability of observing the evidence (his characteristics) given that he is in that particular field.
3. **Evidence (P(E))**: The total probability of observing the evidence regardless of the field, which can be computed by summing the products of each field's prior and the likelihood of observing the evidence for that field. However, since the total doesn't need to add up to 1 (as there are other fields), we can compute the relative probabilities.

For simplicity, I'll make some assumptions regarding the priors and likelihoods:

Assume:
- The prior probabilities (P(H)) of Adam being in each field are roughly equal, say 1/3 for simplicity (though this might not be realistic in a real-world setting).

We'll qualitatively estimate the likelihoods (P(E|H)) based on the personality sketch:
- Adam's characteristics are highly aligned with "agricultural and veterinary science" due to his love for nature, animals, and empathy.
- His characteristics are moderately aligned with "computer science" since his high intelligence and ability to solve puzzles can be beneficial here, but the nature focus is less relevant.
- His characteristics are less aligned with "business administration" since there's no mention of skills or interests relevant to business administration.

Letâ€™s assume:
- P(E | H_agricultural) = 0.9
- P(E | H_computer) = 0.4
- P(E | H_business) = 0.1

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since:
\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]
Then:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) = 0.3 \times (0.9 + 0.4 + 0.1) = 0.3 \times 1.4 = 0.42 \]

Now we compute:
\[ P(H_agricultural|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.42} = \frac{0.3}{0.42} = \frac{30}{42} \approx 0.714 \]
\[ P(H_computer|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.42} = \frac{0.133}{0.42} \approx 0.317 \]
\[ P(H_business|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.42} = \frac{0.033}{0.42} \approx 0.079 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.079,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.714,
  "computer science": 0.317
}
```
