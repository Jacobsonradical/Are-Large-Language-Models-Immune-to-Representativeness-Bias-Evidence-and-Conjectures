To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we do not have empirical data for the prior probability \( P(H) \) nor the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) or \( P(E) \) directly. We will proceed with qualitative analysis based on the given characteristics.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, this field aligns closely with his interests and empathetic personality. It is reasonable to assume that pursuing a field related to agriculture or veterinary science correlates highly with his traits.

2. **Business Administration**: Business Administration does not appear to align well with Adam's personality sketch. Although understanding hard work and dedication is relevant, the rest of his traits focus more on nature, animals, and abstract thinking rather than commerce or management.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts would make this field a strong candidate as well. Computer Science often involves puzzles, logic, and problem-solving skills, aligning with his interests.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can assign subjective probabilities that reflect Adam's likelihood of being in each field:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.3"
}
```

Again, these values are based on qualitative interpretations of Adam's personality sketch matching with the probable fields of study. For precise calculations, empirical data would be required.
