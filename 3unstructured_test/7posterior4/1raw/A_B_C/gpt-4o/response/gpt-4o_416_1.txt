To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \( E \).

We do not have exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), so we will make reasonable assumptions based on the given personality sketch \( E \).

Given \( E \), let's make an educated guess about the likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, enjoys solving puzzles, has a deep love for animals, and has high intelligence in abstract concepts. These traits aren't typically associated strongly with business administration, where interests might be more oriented towards economics, management, and organizational studies. So, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common field, so the prior \( P(H) \) might be moderate.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science, given his love for nature, plants, and animals. Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
   - \( P(H) \): Agricultural and veterinary science might be less common than business administration but still reasonably common.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \): While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, his strong empathy, warm heart, and love for animals do not directly align with computer science, making \( P(E|H) \) moderate to low.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a very common field.

To compute \( P(H|E) \) without exact values for priors and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative assessments based on the fit of Adam's personality with each field. 

Let's assign qualitative scores (for simplicity) on a scale from 0 to 1 based on the fit between \( E \) and each field:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Low fit due to differing primary interests.
   - Hypothetical score: \( 0.1 \)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - High fit due to strong alignment in interests and traits.
   - Hypothetical score: \( 0.8 \)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Moderate to low fit due to mismatched primary interests but some alignment in skills.
   - Hypothetical score: \( 0.3 \)

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximated as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
