To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (i.e., field of specialization), we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific probability values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only provide a qualitative estimation rather than a precise numerical value. 

Given the personality sketch and assuming some plausible priors based on general knowledge:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - **Curiosity about nature, puzzles, intelligence**: These traits can be compatible with computer science.
   - **Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals**: These traits are less directly pertinent to computer science.
   - **Abstract concepts**: Highly relevant to computer science.
   - Overall, there's some alignment but not perfect.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Curiosity about nature, empathy, animals**: These traits do not typically align well with business administration.
   - **Understanding and appreciation for hard work**: Relevant to business studies.
   - Overall, weak alignment.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, warm heart, empathy**: Directly relevant and highly consistent.
   - **Intelligence and abstract concepts**: Can be beneficial in scientific and veterinary disciplines.
   - **Appreciation for hard work**: Strongly aligns with the dedication required in these fields.
   - Overall, strong alignment.

Considering these factors qualitatively, we can estimate the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values indicate that given Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, moderately likely in computer science, and least likely in business administration.
