To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for each of the fields, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the lack of specific values for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must use reasonable assumptions to estimate these probabilities. Here's a simplified approach based on the provided personality sketch:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (H1)**:
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H1) \)**: High, since Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.
  - **Prior \( P(H1) \)**: Moderate, since this is a specialized field, which not all students choose.

- **Computer Science (H2)**:
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H2) \)**: Moderate, as Adam’s high intelligence and proficiency in solving puzzles relate to computer science, though his empathy and love for animals are less directly related.
  - **Prior \( P(H2) \)**: High, considering the popularity of computer science among graduate students.

- **Business Administration (H3)**:
  - **Likelihood \( P(E|H3) \)**: Low, as Adam’s traits do not strongly align with typical characteristics needed in business administration (e.g., leadership, financial acumen).
  - **Prior \( P(H3) \)**: Moderate to high, given the popularity of MBA programs.

Without specific \( P(E) \) values, we focus on the relative likelihoods and priors. Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect the hypothesis that Adam's personality and interests most strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science and, least likely, business administration.
