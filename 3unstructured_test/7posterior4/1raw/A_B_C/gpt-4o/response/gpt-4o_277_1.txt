To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for the fields given Adam's personality sketch, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that detailed prior probabilities \( P(H) \), likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and evidence \( P(E) \) values are not provided, I'll assume a general understanding based on the typical characteristics associated with these fields and Adam's personality sketch. Here are the qualitative assessments for the likelihoods:

1. **Business Administration** tends to attract people with strong interpersonal communication skills and interest in business operations, which doesn't strongly correlate with Adam’s described personality traits.
2. **Computer Science** often attracts individuals who enjoy solving puzzles and have high intelligence for abstract concepts, correlating moderately with Adam’s personality traits.
3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science** aligns closely with Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals, reflecting a high correlation with his traits.

We will make informed qualitative estimations:

- **P(E|H) values**:
  - Business Administration: Low
  - Computer Science: Moderate
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High

- **P(H) values**:
  - These are general and equal priors for simplicity, say 1/3 for each if we assume no prior reason to favor one over the other.

Since exact values are undefined, we cannot numerically compute the exact posterior probabilities. However, we can provide informed qualitative conditional probabilities within a reasonable range:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood based on Adam's personality sketch correlating with the typical characteristics of each field. Agricultural and Veterinary Science has the highest probability due to the strong alignment with Adam's love for nature and animals.
