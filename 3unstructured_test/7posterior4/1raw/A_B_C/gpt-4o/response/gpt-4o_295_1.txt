To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis. Since we are not given explicit numerical values for these priors and likelihoods, we will qualitatively assess the information based on the personality sketch (E) of Adam.

Given:
- E: The personality sketch of Adam.
- H: Hypotheses that Adam was enrolled in specific fields.

We will use Bayes' rule in the general form:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without numerical data, we can establish relative likelihoods:

1. \( P(E|H_{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): High
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals, making this field highly likely.

2. \( P(E|H_{computer science}) \): Moderate to High
   - Adam is good at solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which aligns with computer science.

3. \( P(E|H_{business administration}) \): Low to Moderate
   - Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, but business administration is less directly related to his interests in nature and animals.

Qualitatively, we hypothesize the following probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values are based on the fit of Adam's personality traits and interests with the fields described.
