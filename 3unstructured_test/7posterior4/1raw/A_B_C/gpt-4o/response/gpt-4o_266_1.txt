To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, the prior probability of each hypothesis, and the total probability of the evidence. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence \(E\).

Given the personality sketch \(E\) and the hypotheses, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the prior probabilities and likelihoods. 

But since we lack specific prior probability values and detailed statistical data, we'll use subjective assessments based on the given sketch to estimate the relative likelihoods. 

**Assumptions for Likelihoods:**
- Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for nature, \(P(E|agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science)\) will be relatively high.
- Given his intelligence and skills in solving puzzles, \(P(E|computer \, science)\) will also be relatively high.
- Given these traits, \(P(E|business \, administration)\) will be lower, as the sketch does not provide strong indicators for business administration interests.

Here's the subjective analysis in numerical form:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) \) is high due to his love for animals and nature appreciation.
   - Let's set \( P(E|agricultural \, and \, veterinary \, science) = 0.8 \) (indicating a high match).

2. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|computer \, science) \) is moderate to high because of his intelligence and problem-solving skills.
   - Let's set \( P(E|computer \, science) = 0.6 \) (indicating a fair chance).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|business \, administration) \) is low because the sketch doesn’t align strongly with typical business administration traits.
   - Let's set \( P(E|business \, administration) = 0.2 \) (indicating a low match).

For simplicity, we consider equal priors for each field, \( P(H) \approx 1/3 \), given we have little specific information about Adam's initial likelihood to be in any of the fields.

Combining these, we'll approximate \( P(E) \) as the sum of the likelihoods of \(E\) for the given hypotheses, normalized by their prior probabilities.

Therefore:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8 * (1/3) / ((0.8 * (1/3)) + (0.6 * (1/3)) + (0.2 * (1/3))) ≈ 0.4444,
  
  "computer science": 0.6 * (1/3) / ((0.8 * (1/3)) + (0.6 * (1/3)) + (0.2 * (1/3))) ≈ 0.3333,

  "business administration": 0.2 * (1/3) / ((0.8 * (1/3)) + (0.6 * (1/3)) + (0.2 * (1/3))) ≈ 0.1111
}
```

This is a simplified calculation for illustration purposes. Actual values would depend heavily on more detailed data and prior probabilities.
