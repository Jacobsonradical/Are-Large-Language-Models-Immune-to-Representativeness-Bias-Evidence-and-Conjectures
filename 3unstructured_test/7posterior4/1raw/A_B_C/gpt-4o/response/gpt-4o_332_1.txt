To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack specific quantitative data for prior probabilities \( P(H) \), the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the marginal probability \( P(E) \). Let's make some logical assumptions based on the given traits and use them for a comparative analysis:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:** Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine interest in nature and plants, and empathy, which align well with this field.
2. **Computer science:** Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, and he enjoys solving puzzles, which are relevant to this field.
3. **Business administration:** Although Adam has strong empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication, these traits are less directly aligned with business administration compared to the other two fields.

Let's make some semi-quantitative assumptions to reflect these alignments:
- For **agricultural and veterinary science**, given Adam's personality, let's assume a higher likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)).
- For **computer science**, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving ability, let's assume a moderate likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)).
- For **business administration**, given less direct alignment with his traits, assume a lower likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)).

Assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity, we can make the following educated guesses:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.45,
  "computer science": 0.35,
  "business administration": 0.20
}

These values reflect the fact that Adam's described personality, interests, and abilities are most consistent with a field like agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, with business administration being less likely given the specifics of his personality sketch.
