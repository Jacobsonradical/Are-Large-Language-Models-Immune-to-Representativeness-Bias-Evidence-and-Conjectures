To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we would typically need prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihoods of the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Given that we do not have specific numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch and the nature of the fields. 

Let's denote the prior probabilities of each hypothesis as follows:

- \( P(H_{agricultural}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{business}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is in business administration.
- \( P(H_{computer}) \) = Prior probability that Adam is in computer science.

Since we do not have the specific values, we'll assume these priors to be equal for simplicity (which is a common approach when we lack specific prior information):

- \( P(H_{agricultural}) \approx \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(H_{business}) \approx \frac{1}{3} \)
- \( P(H_{computer}) \approx \frac{1}{3} \)

Now, we'll estimate the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \):

- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \): Based on the sketch, Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. He is empathetic and appreciates hard work, which are characteristics that align well with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, we'll assign a relatively high conditional probability.
  
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \): Adam's personality traits (love for nature, plants, puzzles, animals, empathy) are less indicative of a business administration student. Thus, we'll assign a lower conditional probability.

- \( P(E|H_{computer}) \): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, traits that are often found in computer science students. Therefore, we can assign a moderate to high conditional probability.

Letâ€™s assign the likelihoods based on these qualitative assessments (on a scale from 0 to 1):
  
- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(E|H_{computer}) \approx 0.5 \)

For the overall evidence \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer}) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx \frac{0.7 + 0.2 + 0.5}{3} \]
\[ P(E) \approx \frac{1.4}{3} \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.467 \]

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For agricultural and veterinary science:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.5 \]

For business administration:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.143 \]

For computer science:
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer})}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \approx 0.357 \]

So, to summarize:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.143,
  "computer science": 0.357
}

These are rough estimates given the qualitative assessments of the evidence likelihoods.
