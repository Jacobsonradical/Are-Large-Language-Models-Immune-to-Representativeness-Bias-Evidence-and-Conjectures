To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we rely on Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specified field, given his personality sketch \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), given that Adam was enrolled in the specified field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in the specified field before considering his personality sketch.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \).

Given the personality sketch, we need to make educated guesses about the relative probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field.

Assumptions:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is high because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, and empathy, which aligns well with this field.
   - Assume an intermediate prior probability \( P(H) \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is lower because the personality sketch doesnâ€™t strongly align with typical characteristics for this field.
   - Assume a lower prior probability \( P(H) \).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high because Adam enjoys solving puzzles, has high intelligence, and can understand abstract concepts.
   - Assume an intermediate prior probability \( P(H) \).

Without specific data, the exact computation is challenging, so we estimate these probabilities based on logical reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihoods given Adam's personality traits and possible interest areas.
