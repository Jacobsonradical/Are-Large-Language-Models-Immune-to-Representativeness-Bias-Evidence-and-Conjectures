To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of study using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, we lack specific numerical data to compute precise probabilities. Still, we can make educated estimates based on the description provided.

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of the personality sketches given that Adam is enrolled in each field.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of a graduate student being enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of the personality sketch.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we estimate how well his traits match each field and make qualitative judgments as follows:

### Estimates:
1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(E|H): Adam's traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, understanding of hard work) don't align strongly with typical business administration profiles.
     - Estimated P(E|H) ≈ 0.1
   - P(H): Business administration is a common graduate field, but not as aligned with Adam’s traits.
     - Estimated P(H) ≈ 0.2

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(E|H): The subject has a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary sciences, given his interest in nature, plants, and animals.
     - Estimated P(E|H) ≈ 0.8
   - P(H): Fewer graduate students are in this field compared to business or computer science, but it matches Adam's profile well.
     - Estimated P(H) ≈ 0.1

3. **Computer Science**:
   - P(E|H): Adam's inclination towards puzzles and high intelligence fits many aspects of computer science.
     - Estimated P(E|H) ≈ 0.6
   - P(H): There is a strong number of graduate students in computer science.
     - Estimated P(H) ≈ 0.2

### Calculation (Qualitative):
To provide a qualitative posterior conditional probability, we rationalize:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - P(H|E) ≈ \( \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \)
   - This yields a relatively low probability as it doesn't fit Adam's profile well.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - P(H|E) ≈ \( \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \)
   - This is likely the highest given the close alignment with Adam's interests and personality.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - P(H|E) ≈ \( \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \)
   - This is also substantial but not as high as agricultural and veterinary science.

### Result:
Based on these estimates, we get:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.04,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.12
}
```

The values reflect the relative alignment of Adam's personality with each field based on qualitative judgments. Note that these are relative probabilities and not normalized.
