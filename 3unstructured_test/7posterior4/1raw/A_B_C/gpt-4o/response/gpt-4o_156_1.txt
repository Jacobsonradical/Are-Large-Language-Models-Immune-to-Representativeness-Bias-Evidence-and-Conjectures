To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), we use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \).

Given that we do not have exact numerical values for P(H), P(E|H), and P(E), we will make qualitative estimations based on the description provided for Adam and common characteristics of graduate fields.

### Analyzing Likelihoods (P(E|H)):

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work. These traits are highly relevant to this field, so \( P(E|H) \) is high.
- **Business Administration:** Adam is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles and has strong empathy, which are not directly applicable to business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is low.
- **Computer Science:** Although Adam is good at understanding abstract concepts and loves solving puzzles, these interests and skills align well with computer science. \( P(E|H) \) is moderate to high.

### Analyzing Priors (P(H)):
Assuming that all fields have an equal base rate of enrollment among graduate students:

Prior probabilities (P(H)) might be roughly equal without additional context. However, enrollment in business administration programs might generally be higher than in agricultural and veterinary sciences or computer science.

To simplify, let's assume the following prior probabilities based on general perceptions: 
- \( P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.3 \)

By combining these qualitative assessments with Bayes' Rule, we can generate rough estimations for the posterior probabilities:

### Posterior Calculations (P(H|E)):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \approx \) high
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(H|E) \approx \text{relatively high}\)

2. **Business Administration:**
   - \( P(E|H) \approx \) low
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H|E) \approx \text{relatively low}\)

3. **Computer Science:**
   - \( P(E|H) \approx \) moderate to high
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)
   - \( P(H|E) \approx \text{moderately high}\)

Finally, let's assign approximate numerical values for clarity. Note that these values are indicative and should be refined with actual data where possible:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are based on the qualitative fit of Adam's personality to each field of study.
