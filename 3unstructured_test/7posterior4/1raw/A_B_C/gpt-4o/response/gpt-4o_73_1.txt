To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to form a general understanding of Bayes' rule in the context of this problem.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the priors probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

For each field, we need to make educated estimates on \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, without concrete statistics (e.g., the proportion of graduate students in each field or the likelihood of a given personality type in each field), we must rely on the given personality sketch of Adam and reasonable assumptions based on the nature of each field. 

Let's break down each likely estimation based on Adam's traits:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," "a deep love for animals," and "empathy." These traits align strongly with this field.
2. **Business Administration**: While Adam is described to have a “high intelligence” and "strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication," other personality traits like love for nature and animals don't strongly align with common characteristics found in this field.
3. **Computer Science**: Adam is “good at understanding abstract concepts” and likes “solving puzzles,” which fit computer science much better than business administration, although not as closely as his traits align with agricultural and veterinary sciences.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign conditional probabilities:

- \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science should be high because Adam's traits strongly align with this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for business administration should be low because there's little alignment between his traits and this field.
- \( P(E|H) \) for computer science should be moderate because some traits are relevant, but it's not as strong.

Assuming a uniform prior \( P(H) \) since we do not have different base rates for each field:

1. \( P(H = \text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \)
2. \( P(H = \text{business administration}) \)
3. \( P(H = \text{computer science}) \)

Without specific base rates, we assume: \( P(H_1) = P(H_2) = P(H_3) = \frac{1}{3} \).

Given this:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

This simplified estimation reflects a strong fit for agricultural and veterinary science, a moderate fit for computer science, and a weak fit for business administration based on the description of Adam.
