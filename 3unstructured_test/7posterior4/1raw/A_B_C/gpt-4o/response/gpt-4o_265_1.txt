To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the following:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \) given that he is enrolled in the field \( H \).
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).
3. \( P(E) \): The probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( E \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without concrete numerical data, we can still reason qualitatively about the likelihoods:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it seems highly probable that Adam could be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.

2. **Computer Science:**
   Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which are important skills in computer science. However, his specific interests in nature and animals might make this less likely compared to agricultural and veterinary science.

3. **Business Administration:**
   His empathy and appreciation for hard work can be useful in business administration, but there are fewer direct connections between his love for nature and animals with this field than with the other two.

Based on this qualitative reasoning, we might assign approximate values to the probabilities:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Note that these values are estimates based on the qualitative match of Adam's personality sketch to typical characteristics of those fields. To provide exact probabilities, we would need concrete data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).
