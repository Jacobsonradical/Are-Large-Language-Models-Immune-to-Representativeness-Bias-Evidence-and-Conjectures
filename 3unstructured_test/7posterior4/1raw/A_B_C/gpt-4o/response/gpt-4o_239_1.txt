Applying Bayes' rule to determine the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field requires knowing the prior probabilities of enrolling in each field, \( P(H) \), and the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given each field, \( P(E|H) \). I'll proceed with reasonable assumptions for these priors and likelihoods based on typical characteristics associated with each field.

Let's assume:
- Prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)):
  - \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.25 \]
  - \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.15 \]
  - \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.20 \]
  
- Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \)):
  - Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihood is considerably high for fields closely related to his traits. For simplicity, let's assume:
  - \[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4 \]
  - \[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \]
  - \[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which is the sum of the numerators for all fields we are considering:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.15) + (0.1 \cdot 0.20) = 0.1 + 0.105 + 0.02 = 0.225 \]

Now, compute posteriors for each field:

1. **Computer Science**
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.225} = \frac{0.1}{0.225} \approx 0.444 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.15}{0.225} = \frac{0.105}{0.225} \approx 0.467 \]

3. **Business Administration**
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.225} = \frac{0.02}{0.225} \approx 0.089 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.444,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.467,
  "business administration": 0.089
}
