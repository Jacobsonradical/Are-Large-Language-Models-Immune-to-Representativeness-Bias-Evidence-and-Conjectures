To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field (\( P(H) \)) and the likelihood of his personality sketch (\( E \)) given that he is in a particular field (\( P(E|H) \)). For simplicity, let's assume we have no specific prior information, so we treat the priors as uniform. Then, we need to focus on the likelihoods \( P(E|H_{\text{field}}) \).

Adam's personality sketch suggests high intelligence, appreciation for nature and hard work, empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature and plants, and enjoyment in solving puzzles. These traits align differently with each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - High intelligence and appreciation for nature, curiosity about plants, love for animals all align with AVS.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is high.

2. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - High intelligence and appreciation for hard work can fit BA, but empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) is lower compared to AVS.

3. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - High intelligence, enjoyment in solving puzzles, and understanding abstract concepts align with CS.
   - Empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant but not opposed.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) is moderate to high.

Let's assume:
\[
P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) = 0.8, P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) = 0.2, P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) = 0.5
\]

Given equal priors for the fields \( P(H_{\text{field}}) = \frac{1}{3} \):

Applying Bayes' Rule \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), but since priors are equal and \( P(E) \) cancels out for comparison, we directly use the likelihoods proportionally:

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) \propto 0.8, P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) \propto 0.2, P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) \propto 0.5
\]

The probability distribution (normalized) would look like:

\[
\text{Normalization constant} = 0.8 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.5
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{0.8}{1.5} \approx 0.533
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{0.2}{1.5} \approx 0.133
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{0.5}{1.5} \approx 0.333
\]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
  "business administration": 0.133,
  "computer science": 0.333
}
