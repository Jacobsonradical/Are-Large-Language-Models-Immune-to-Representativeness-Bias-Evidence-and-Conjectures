To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities of each field and the likelihood of the evidence (E) given the hypothesis (H). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical priors or likelihoods, I can't give exact values. Instead, I will discuss the relative influence of Adam's personality sketch (E) on the likelihood of him being in each field as:

- Computer Science (CS): High intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles suggest a decent fit for CS, but no specific indication of a strong inclination towards computer programming or software engineering.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, plus high empathy, makes this a strong contender.
- Business Administration: Although high intelligence and appreciation for hard work might fit business administration, there is less specific alignment with Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals.

Given the above analysis, here is a qualitative estimation:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are approximate and based on qualitative reasoning. For exact probabilities, quantitative data on the priors and likelihoods are necessary.
