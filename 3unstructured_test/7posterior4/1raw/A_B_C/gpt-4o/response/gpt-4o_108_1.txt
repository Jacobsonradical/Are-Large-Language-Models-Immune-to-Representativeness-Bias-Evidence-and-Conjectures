To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the formula which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we lack specific data like the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), I'll make some educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch of Adam and common knowledge.

### Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants" and "deep love for animals" which are highly relevant to this field.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \) should be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is described as "good at understanding abstract concepts" and "enjoys solving puzzles", which are traits aligned with computer science.
   - However, there is no explicit mention of computer science interests, resulting in a moderate probability for \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's traits such as "warm heart", "strong empathy", and "understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication" can be valuable in business.
   - Nevertheless, there's no specific indication in E that he is leaning towards business, hence \( P(E|H_{business\_administration}) \) might be lower compared to the other fields.

Given these qualitative assessments, I am providing an educated estimate for the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the common prerequisites or interests associated with each field.
