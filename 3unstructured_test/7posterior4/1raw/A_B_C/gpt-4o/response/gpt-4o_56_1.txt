To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, as well as the prior probability of each hypothesis. 

The formula for Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors or the likelihoods, let's adopt a proportional approach based on the information given and reasonable assumptions:

1. **Business administration**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adam's interests and personality sketch don't align strongly with business administration. The focus on nature, animals, and abstract concepts seems less relevant to this field.
   - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Relatively high, as business administration is a common graduate field.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science. Empathy and appreciation for hard work are also relevant here.
   - Prior \( P(H_{AVS}) \): May not be as high as business administration but still significant due to the specificity of interest.

3. **Computer science**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Adam's intelligence and proficiency in understanding abstract concepts align with computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals is less directly related.
   - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): High, as computer science is a very popular field.

Based on the qualitative assessment, we hypothesize the following proportions:

- \( P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \): Low
- \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) \): High
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) \): Medium

Given these qualitative assessments, the posterior probabilities might look like this:

{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

These values are presented as approximations based on reasonable assumptions and the qualitative nature of the given evidence and hypotheses.
