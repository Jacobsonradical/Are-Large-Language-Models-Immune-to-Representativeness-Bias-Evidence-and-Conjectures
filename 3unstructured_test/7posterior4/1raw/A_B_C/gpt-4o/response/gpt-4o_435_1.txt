To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the observed personality sketch \(E\) given each hypothesis \(H\), the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \(P(H)\), and the overall probability of the evidence \(P(E)\). Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we do not have specific numerical values for \(P(H)\) (prior probabilities), \(P(E|H)\) (likelihood), and \(P(E)\) (evidence), we will make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam and general knowledge of the fields mentioned.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities \(P(H)\):**
   - Without additional data, we assume that Adam being enrolled in any of the fields has a roughly equal prior probability. We assume \(P(H) = \frac{1}{3}\) for simplicity.

2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\):**
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Given Adam's interest in nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it is highly likely for Adam to be in this field. We can set \(P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8\).
   - **Computer Science:** Though Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, there is less direct alignment with his deep love for animals and nature. Therefore, we set \(P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.4\).
   - **Business Administration:** This field doesn't align as well with Adam's personality sketch related to nature, animals, and empathy. We will assign \(P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.2\).

3. **Overall Evidence \(P(E)\):**
   - Given that we are only comparing these three fields, and assuming the fields are exhaustive and mutually exclusive for this context, and normalizing for comparison, we have:
     \[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{computer science}})P(H_{\text{computer science}}) + P(E|H_{\text{business administration}})P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \]
     \[ P(E) =  (0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.4 \times \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}) \]
     \[ P(E) = \frac{0.8 + 0.4 + 0.2}{3} = \frac{1.4}{3} \approx 0.467 \]

### Posterior Conditional Probabilities:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \times P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} | E) = \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} | E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.333}{0.467} \approx 0.571 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \times P(H_{\text{computer science}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) = \frac{0.4 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) \approx \frac{0.4 \times 0.333}{0.467} \approx 0.286 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \times P(H_{\text{business administration}})}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) = \frac{0.2 \times \frac{1}{3}}{0.467} \]
   \[ P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) \approx \frac{0.2 \times 0.333}{0.467} \approx 0.143 \]
