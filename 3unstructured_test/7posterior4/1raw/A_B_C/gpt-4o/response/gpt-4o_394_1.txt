To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits given that he is enrolled in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of observing Adam's personality traits across all fields.

Since we don't have explicit numerical values, we'll make qualitative estimations based on the description provided. 

Let's assign qualitative likelihoods and then convert them to numerical probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High probability, given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate probability, as it is a less common field compared to business and computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low to moderate probability. While Adam has traits like intelligence and appreciation for hard work, his interest in nature and animals doesn't particularly align with business administration.
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively high, as business administration is a common field of study.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate probability. Adamâ€™s intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well, but his deep interest in nature and animals is less connected to computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Relatively high, considering the popularity and broad application of computer science.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity (\( P(H_{A}) = P(H_{B}) = P(H_{C}) = 1/3 \)) and estimating likelihoods qualitatively, we can assign rough values:

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(E|H_A) = 0.8 \)
- For Business Administration: \( P(E|H_B) = 0.3 \)
- For Computer Science: \( P(E|H_C) = 0.5 \)

Assuming \( P(E) = 1 \) for normalization:

\[
P(H|E) \approx \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
P(H_A|E) = P(E|H_A) \cdot P(H_A) & = 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.267 \\
P(H_B|E) = P(E|H_B) \cdot P(H_B) & = 0.3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.1 \\
P(H_C|E) = P(E|H_C) \cdot P(H_C) & = 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.167 \\
\end{array}
\right
\]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.267,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.167
}
```
