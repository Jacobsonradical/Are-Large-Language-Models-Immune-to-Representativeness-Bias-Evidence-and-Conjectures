To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability \( P(H_i) \) of Adam being enrolled in each field \( i \), the likelihood \( P(E|H_i) \) of observing Adam's characteristics given he is enrolled in that field, and the evidence term \( P(E) \) which is the same for all hypotheses and can be ignored for this relative comparison.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H_i | E) = \frac{P(E | H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

We’ll assume that:
1. **Business Administration**: The prior \( P(H_{ba}) \) is relatively moderate compared to other fields given the commonality of the field.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The prior \( P(H_{avs}) \) might be relatively lower as it is a more specialized field but fits well with Adam's interest in nature and animals.
3. **Computer Science**: The prior \( P(H_{cs}) \) is moderate to high given the prevalence of the field, coupled with Adam’s intellectual abilities in abstract concepts and puzzle-solving skills.

**Likelihood estimates**:
1. **Business Administration**: Given Adam's interest in nature, empathy, and puzzle-solving, the likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \) might be relatively low.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: The likelihood \( P(E|H_{avs}) \) is high due to his specific profile fitting well with interests in plants, animals, and nature.
3. **Computer Science**: The likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \) might be moderate to high given his puzzle-solving skills and abstract thinking.

Given these considerations, we're looking at a qualitative comparison rather than exact numerical calculations, bearing in mind the relative matching of the personality sketch to each field.

Thus, we estimate:
```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
These values suggest that it is most likely Adam is enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science given his interests and personality, with a considerable probability for Computer Science due to his intellectual abilities, while Business Administration is less likely.
