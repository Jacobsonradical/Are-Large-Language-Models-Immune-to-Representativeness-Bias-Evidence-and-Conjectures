To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we'll need to take into account:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the probability of a graduate student being enrolled in a given field before considering Adam's personality sketch.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a particular field.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have exact prior probabilities or specific likelihood values, I'll make a qualitative assessment based on the given sketch. Let's assume the following approximate values for the likelihoods based on Adam's personality traits:

- Agricultural and veterinary science: Likelihood is high because of his love for nature, plants, and animals.
- Computer science: Likelihood is moderate due to his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, although it does not perfectly align with his empathy and love for plants and animals.
- Business administration: Likelihood is low because his personality traits do not strongly align with the typical attributes associated with this field.

Let's denote the priors \( P(H) \) based on general distributions in graduate fields, and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on qualitative assessment:

```markdown
- Agricultural and veterinary science: Prior = 0.1, Likelihood = 0.9
- Computer science: Prior = 0.3, Likelihood = 0.6
- Business administration: Prior = 0.2, Likelihood = 0.2
```

Now, we will calculate the posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \]

2. **Computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \]

3. **Business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{P(E)} \]

We need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \times 0.1 + 0.6 \times 0.3 + 0.2 \times 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.09 + 0.18 + 0.04 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.31 \]

Now, calculate each posterior:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.31} \approx 0.290 \]

2. **Computer science**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{0.31} \approx 0.580 \]

3. **Business administration**:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.31} \approx 0.129 \]

So, the final results are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.290,
  "computer science": 0.580,
  "business administration": 0.129
}
```
