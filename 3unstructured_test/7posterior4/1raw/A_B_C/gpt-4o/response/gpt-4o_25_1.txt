To determine the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis given the personality sketch E using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of E given H and the prior probability of H.

Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific statistical data on the distribution of graduate students across fields and how the described traits correlate with fields of study, precise numerical values for the probabilities are challenging to compute. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and how well it matches common traits in each field.

Assumptions for qualitative analysis:
- \( P(E|H) \) reflects how well Adam's traits fit typical students in the field.
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability) assumes a relatively balanced distribution of graduate students across fields.
- \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and thus does not affect our comparisons directly.

Given Adam's profile:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong curiosity about nature and plants.
   - Deep love for animals.
   - Warm heart and empathy.
   - These traits strongly align with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Solving puzzles and high intelligence may fit.
   - However, less emphasis on curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy toward the environment.
   - Traits do not strongly align.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well.
   - Enjoyment of solving puzzles fits.
   - Less direct connection to empathy, nature, and animals, though not entirely excluded.

Based on the qualitative assessment, the likelihood ratios would suggest:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7 (highly likely given Adam's interests and traits),
  "business administration": 0.1 (less likely, fewer matching traits),
  "computer science": 0.4 (moderately likely given intelligence and puzzle-solving traits but not as high as Agricultural and Veterinary Science)
}

While this is a qualitative judgment, more precise calculations would require detailed statistical data.
