To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality characteristics given enrollment in each field. However, without specific data for prior probabilities or likelihoods, we need to estimate these based on plausibility derived from his personality sketch.

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in computer science.
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \): The probability of Adam's characteristics given he is in business administration.
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) \): The prior probability of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_{\text{computer}}) \): The prior probability of being in computer science.
- \( P(H_{\text{business}}) \): The prior probability of being in business administration.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of Adam's characteristics.

Given the personality sketch of Adam:
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy heavily align with characteristics beneficial for studying agricultural and veterinary science.
- His enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence fits with computer science, though without a specific interest in technology or programming mentioned.
- His strong understanding and appreciation for hard work might align with business administration, but the personality traits don't strongly align with typical business administration characteristics.

While we cannot compute exact probabilities without data, we can qualitatively assess the likely order of these domains. Letâ€™s approximate the likelihoods based on Adam's traits:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer}}) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business}}) \approx 0.1 \)

Assuming equal priors for simplicity \( P(H_{\text{agricultural}}) = P(H_{\text{computer}}) = P(H_{\text{business}}) = 0.33 \):

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{agricultural}} | E) & = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{P(E)} = \frac{0.231}{P(E)} \\
P(H_{\text{computer}} | E) & = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.33}{P(E)} = \frac{0.099}{P(E)} \\
P(H_{\text{business}} | E) & = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{P(E)} = \frac{0.033}{P(E)}
\end{align*}
\]

However, \( P(E) \) is a normalization factor, but we only need the relative magnitudes for these estimates. Thus, we can report these as such, knowing they approximate relative beliefs:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{\text{agricultural}} | E) & \approx 0.7 \\
P(H_{\text{computer}} | E) & \approx 0.3 \\
P(H_{\text{business}} | E) & \approx 0.1
\end{align*}
\]

Hence, the answer in the required format would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
