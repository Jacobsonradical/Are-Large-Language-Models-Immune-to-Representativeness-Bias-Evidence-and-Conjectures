Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have precise prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for being enrolled in a specific graduate field based on the personality sketch, we will need to make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the provided personality traits and interests to estimate these probabilities.

Based on the personality sketch:

- **Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.**
- **He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.**
- **He is quiet, enjoys solving puzzles, intelligent, and good at understanding abstract concepts.**

Given these traits, let's qualitatively evaluate each field:

### 1. Business Administration
- Business Administration usually involves skills like leadership, strategic thinking, and often deals more with human behavior in organizations and finance, rather than with nature, plants, or animals.
- Given Adam’s traits, the likelihood that he fits into this category seems relatively low.

### 2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science directly concerns nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with Adam’s genuine curiosity about these areas, as well as his empathy and love for animals.
- The fit with his personality sketch is quite high.

### 3. Computer Science
- Computer Science involves a lot of abstract thinking and problem-solving, which matches Adam's intelligence and enjoyment in solving puzzles.
- However, it does not directly align with his strong interest in nature and animals, which might make it a less likely fit compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science, but still a plausible field for him.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's assign some reasonable approximate values for the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values represent a reasonable qualitative estimate based on the provided information about Adam.
