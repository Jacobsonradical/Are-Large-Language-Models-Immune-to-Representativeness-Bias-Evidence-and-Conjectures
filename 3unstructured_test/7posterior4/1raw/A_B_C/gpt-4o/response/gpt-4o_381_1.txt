To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need the following:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can make educated guesses based on the personality sketch.

Let's break this down for each field.

### Computer Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{cs}) \)**:
  - While traits like high intelligence and a good understanding of abstract concepts align with computer science, his empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals are not typically highlighted in this field.
  
- **Prior \( P(H_{cs}) \)**:
  - Computer Science is a common graduate field, suggesting a moderate to high prior probability.

Given these points, we can approximate:

\[ P(H_{cs}|E) \approx 0.2 \]

### Business Administration

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{ba}) \)**:
  - Traits like a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work align somewhat with business, but other aspects, such as curiosity about nature and empathy, do not align as strongly.
  
- **Prior \( P(H_{ba}) \)**:
  - Business Administration is a very popular field, suggesting a high prior probability.

Given these considerations, we approximate:

\[ P(H_{ba}|E) \approx 0.1 \]

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science

- **Likelihood \( P(E|H_{avs}) \)**:
  - Curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and high intelligence align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
  
- **Prior \( P(H_{avs}) \)**:
  - This field is less common than business or computer science but strongly aligns with the personality traits provided.

Given these points, we approximate:

\[ P(H_{avs}|E) \approx 0.5 \]

Combining these approximations, we have:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Remember, these values are heuristic and based on qualitative assessment without specific prior data or likelihoods.
