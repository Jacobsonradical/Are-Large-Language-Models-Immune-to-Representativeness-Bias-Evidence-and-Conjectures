To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will need to consider the likelihood of observing Adam's personality sketch given each field of study.

Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without precise data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) of Adam's personality given each field, we will need to make some informed estimates based on the description provided for Adam and typical characteristics of students in these fields.

Given the personality traits of Adam:

1. **Curiosity about nature and plants**
2. **Enjoys solving puzzles (indicative of analytical skills)**
3. **Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals**
4. **High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts**
5. **Appreciation for hard work and dedication**

We can proceed with some reasonable assumptions:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High probability due to Adam's love for animals, plants, and empathy.
- Computer Science: Moderate probability due to his enjoyment of solving puzzles and high intelligence.
- Business Administration: Lower probability given that the profile does not strongly align with typical traits associated with this field (e.g., extroversion, leadership, communication focus).

Let's assign some hypothetical likelihoods and priors and calculate:

Assume prior probabilities as:
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \): 0.30 (30%)
- \( P(\text{computer science})\): 0.40 (40%)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): 0.30 (30%)

And the likelihood estimates based on the traits:

- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): 0.10 (10%)
- \( P(E|\text{computer science})\): 0.40 (40%)
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): 0.70 (70%)

We have:

\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{business administration}) \times P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{computer science}) \times P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \times P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.10 \times 0.30 + 0.40 \times 0.40 + 0.70 \times 0.30 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.16 + 0.21 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.40 \]

Now using Bayes' rule for each field:

1. Business Administration:

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \times P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.30}{0.40} \]
\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) \approx 0.075 \]

2. Computer Science:

\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \times P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{0.40 \times 0.40}{0.40} \]
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) \approx 0.40 \]

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science:

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \times P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.30}{0.40} \]
\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) \approx 0.525 \]

Our final estimates are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.075,
  "computer science": 0.40,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.525
}
