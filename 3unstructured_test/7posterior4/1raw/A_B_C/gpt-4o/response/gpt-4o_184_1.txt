To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to provide exact numeric values, we would need specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field. Since we don't have those specific values, we can still make qualitative assessments based on the information provided.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's qualitatively evaluate the likelihood that Adam would be in each of these fields:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work. These traits align well with agricultural and veterinary science, where a deep understanding of nature, plants, and animals is essential.
   - Qualitative assessment: High likelihood.

2. **Business Administration**
   - While Adam has high intelligence and good abstract reasoning, which are beneficial for business administration, his empathy, love for nature and animals, and interest in puzzles do not strongly correlate with the typical interests and motivations for a business administration field.
   - Qualitative assessment: Low to moderate likelihood.

3. **Computer Science**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are important traits for computer science. However, his specific interests in nature, plants, and animals are not directly aligned with computer science, though they are not mutually exclusive.
   - Qualitative assessment: Moderate likelihood.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can assign estimated qualitative probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note that these values are not exact probabilities but rather qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch. The actual probabilities would require more detailed data on prior probabilities and likelihoods.
