To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in different fields given his personality sketch \( E \), we'd use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), I'll infer plausible qualitative assessments based on the provided characteristics and the general likelihood of enrollment in those fields.

Let's analyze the likelihoods based on the given personality sketch \( E \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, it seems plausible that he'd be interested in this field. Hence, \(P(E|H_{\text{avs}})\) is likely high.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence related to abstract concepts, fitting some traits common in computer science. However, there is no direct evidence that he has a particular interest in technology or computers specifically, making \(P(E|H_{\text{cs}})\) moderate.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam possesses a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work which is relevant, his other traits don't align strongly with typically business-focused activities. Therefore, \(P(E|H_{\text{ba}})\) would be lower.

With these qualitative assessments, let's estimate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{\text{avs}}|E) \approx 0.7 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \approx 0.4 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \approx 0.2 \]

Here is the answer formatted as requested:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are approximate and based on qualitative reasoning. Accurate posterior probabilities would require specific data on the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihoods of exhibiting Adam's traits in each field.
