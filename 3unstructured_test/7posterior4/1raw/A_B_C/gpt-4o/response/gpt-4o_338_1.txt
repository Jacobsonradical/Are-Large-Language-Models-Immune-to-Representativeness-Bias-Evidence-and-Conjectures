To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior information, such as the base rates (prior probabilities) for each field of study and the likelihood that someone with Adam's personality traits would be in those fields. Unfortunately, these base rates and likelihoods are not provided explicitly. However, we can make reasonable estimates based on the given personality sketch and common knowledge about these fields.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \) (which serves as a normalizing constant).

For this estimation, we make qualitative judgments:

### Computer Science
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's interest in puzzles and his high intelligence suit computer science. However, his deep love for animals and nature might make this field less likely compared to others.

**Prior \( P(H) \):** Computer science is a fairly popular graduate field.

### Business Administration
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial in business administration. However, the personality sketch doesn't strongly suggest an inclination towards business administration.

**Prior \( P(H) \):** Business administration is one of the more common fields for graduate students.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
**Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and understanding of hard work highly align with this field.

**Prior \( P(H) \):** While not as common as computer science or business administration, agricultural and veterinary science is a specialized field piquing interest in individuals like Adam.

Given these considerations, let's arrange our qualitative judgments into rough estimations for \( P(H|E) \).

\[
P(E|H) = \text{Estimated Likelihood of Adam's traits given the field}
\]
\[
P(H) = \text{Estimated Prior Probability of each field}
\]

Assume:
- \( P(E) \) is the same for all estimates (it’s the sum of the likelihoods across all hypotheses, acting as a normalizer and cancelling out in relative comparison).

We can then give rough relative estimates rather than strict numeric values.

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These values reflect our belief that Adam’s personality sketch strongly suggests a field related to his love for animals and nature, making agricultural and veterinary science notably more probable.
