To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in a specific field given his personality traits.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Adam's personality traits given he was enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Adam having these personality traits across all fields.

However, because we lack specific data on \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only make relative estimates based on the compatibility of Adam's personality traits with each field.

### Estimating \( P(E|H) \):
  
Given the personality traits:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - High likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)) because Adam has a love for nature, empathy for animals, and appreciates hard work.
  
- **Business Administration**:
  - Lower likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)) because while intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are applicable, other traits (such as a love for nature and animals) are less relevant.

- **Computer Science**:
  - Moderate likelihood (\( P(E|H) \)) because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence for understanding abstract concepts. However, traits like love for nature are somewhat less relevant.

### Estimating \( P(H) \):
  
Prior probabilities (\( P(H) \)) for being enrolled in each field might generally be:

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Lower popularity among all graduates.
- Business Administration: High popularity.
- Computer Science: High popularity.

Given the above factors, here are the qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

*Note*: These probabilities are subjective estimates based on the provided information and general popularity of the fields among graduate students. Real-world values may differ with actual data on student distribution and field-related personality trait alignment.
