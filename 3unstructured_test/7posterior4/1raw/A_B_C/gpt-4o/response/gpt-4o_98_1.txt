To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some prior probabilities and likelihoods. However, since we don't have actual statistical priors (e.g., the overall enrollment distribution in these fields or base rates of traits in these fields), we'll need to make intuitive estimates based on the information given in the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability, which we're trying to find.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \), which serves as a normalizing constant.

Since we are comparing the hypothesis about Adam's field of study, we can assume the same normalizing factor \( P(E) \) for each field. Thus, we need to assess the relative likelihoods and priors.

Given Adam's personality sketch, we make these qualitative assessments:

**Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): High, because Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals fits well.
- Prior \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Let's assume moderately low because fewer students might be in this field compared to popular fields like Business and Computer Science.

**Computer Science:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate, Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which align with this field.
- Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): Let's assume high because Computer Science has a large enrollment in graduate studies.

**Business Administration:**
- Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low, Adam's profile does not strongly align with business administration traits.
- Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): Let's assume high, as Business Administration is also a very popular field.

Now, recognizing that concrete numbers would improve accuracy, we can provide some proportionate estimates based on these qualitative assessments:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,  // High fit but lower prior
  "computer science": 0.3,                    // Moderate fit with high prior
  "business administration": 0.1              // Low fit despite high prior
}

These are rough estimates to illustrate the probabilities based on the qualitative match of Adam's characteristics to the fields.
