To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule, which is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the base rates \( P(H) \) (prior probabilities of enrolling in each field) and \( P(E) \) (total probability of observing the evidence) are not provided, we will focus on the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which represents how likely Adam's personality sketch \( E \) would be under each field. We will need to make subjective assessments for the likelihoods, assuming all fields are equally likely without additional context.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, considering Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   
2. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, as Adam's intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles align well with skills required in computer science.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, because this field does not strongly align with traits like a love for nature or animals, although general intelligence could be useful in any field.

Without the base rates and assuming neutrality, the posterior conditional probabilities can be qualitatively assessed as:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

These values represent an approximate understanding based on the personality traits described in the sketch. Further detailed information about base rates and individual likelihood estimations would be needed for precise calculations.
