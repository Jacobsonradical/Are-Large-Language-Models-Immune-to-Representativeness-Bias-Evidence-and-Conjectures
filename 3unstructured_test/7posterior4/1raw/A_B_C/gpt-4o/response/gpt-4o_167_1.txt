To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant, which ensures that the sum of \( P(H|E) \) over all hypotheses is 1. However, since we only need to compare the given fields, \( P(E) \) can be treated as a constant.

Given the information, we don't have exact numerical values for the prior probabilities or the likelihoods. However, we can make qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Since Adam is interested in nature, plants, and animals, he might be less likely to pursue Business Administration compared to the other fields.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The sketch does not strongly align with typical traits of someone in Business Administration, who might focus more on economic, managerial, and leadership aspects.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Higher, given Adam's strong interest and empathy towards animals and plants.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Very high, as the personality sketch strongly aligns with traits common to students in Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

3. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate, as Computer Science is a broad field with many applications, and Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving skills fit well.
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as his interest in puzzles and high intelligence suggest he might enjoy and excel in Computer Science, though the direct interest in nature and animals is less relevant here.

Based on qualitative assessments, we might approximate the proportional probabilities (these are subjective estimates, given the lack of exact numerical values):

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

These numbers are illustrative and convey our intuition based on the given personality sketch. Exact probabilities would require more detailed information about Adam’s preferences and the base rate of students in each field in graduate programs.
