To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \): Posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \): Likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \): Evidence probability (which can be seen as a normalizing constant).

Given that we don't have actual numerical values for the priors and likelihoods, we'll make qualitative estimates based on the provided personality sketch and common knowledge about graduate fields of specialization. 

From the personality sketch of Adam, we can infer the following:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Therefore, we expect \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) to be relatively high.

2. **Business Administration**: This field seems less likely. While empathy and appreciation for hard work could be qualities beneficial in business, there's no specific mention of interest in business-related concepts. Therefore, we expect \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) to be relatively low.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam is a quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important qualities for computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) could be moderately high.

Taking into account these qualitative assessments, let's provide the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are subjective estimates and do not come from strict calculations due to the lack of specific prior and likelihood probabilities. They reflect an educated guess based on the personality sketch provided.
