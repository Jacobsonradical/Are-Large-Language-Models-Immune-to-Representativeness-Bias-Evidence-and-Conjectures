To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we aim to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence (Adam's personality sketch) given the hypothesis (the field of study).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the field of study before observing the evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Without explicit numeric information for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will rely on qualitative reasoning to estimate these probabilities.

### Business Administration
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Business administration is a popular field, but not one typically associated with deep love for nature or animals.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The description of Adam does not strongly fit a typical business administration profile.
- Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is relatively low.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: This field is less common than business administration but more closely aligns with Adam's interests and traits.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, since Adam's personality sketch aligns well with interests in nature, animals, and empathy.
- Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is relatively high.

### Computer Science
- **Prior \( P(H) \)**: Computer science is a highly popular field.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Medium to high, as Adam's intelligence and puzzle-solving skills are valuable in computer science, but interests in nature and animals are less relevant.
- Therefore, \( P(H|E) \) is moderate.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the rough estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are not based on strict numeric calculations but qualitative alignment with Adam's personality sketch.
