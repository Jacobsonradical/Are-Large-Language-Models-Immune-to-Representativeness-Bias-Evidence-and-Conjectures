To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of each field and the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis. Since we don't have exact prior probabilities or likelihood values, I'll use a qualitative approach based on Adam's personality sketch and provide estimates.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's qualitatively assess each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's high intelligence and interest in solving puzzles support this field. However, the absence of a mention of specific interest in technology lowers it a bit.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field among graduate students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this matches very well.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): While less common than some fields, it fits well with Adam's interests.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The personality sketch does not mention specific business interests or skills typically associated with business administration.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field but doesn't align well with the sketch.

Now, let's estimate the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These estimates are based on the qualitative alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the typical requirements and interests for each field. These values are subjective and based on the available information.
