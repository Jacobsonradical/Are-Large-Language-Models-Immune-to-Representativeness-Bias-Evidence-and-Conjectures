To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch E, we'll use Bayes' rule. However, without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods (the probability of observing the evidence given each hypothesis), we have to make some qualitative assessments. 

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, or the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence.

Since we don't have explicit numerical values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we're going to make some reasoned qualitative judgments:

1. **Computer Science**: While Adam's traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles could align with computer science, his strong empathy, love for nature, and animals might make this field less likely.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field strongly aligns with Adam's deep love for animals, his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

3. **Business Administration**: This seems less aligned with Adam's personality traits and interests, given his strong empathy, deep love for animals, and curiosity about nature.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can provide the following estimated probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These probabilities are subjective and based on a qualitative assessment of how well Adam's personality fits each field.
