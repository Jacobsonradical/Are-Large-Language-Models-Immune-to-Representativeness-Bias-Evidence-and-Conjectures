To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to employ the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in order to provide precise numerical values, I would need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field (the proportion of students enrolled in each field) and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for each field (the probability of Adam's personality sketch given that he is in each field). Since those values are not provided, I'll offer a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch and the typical characteristics associated with each field.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: A genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals are less strongly associated with business administration.
   - **P(H)**: Business administration is a common field for graduate students, so its prior might be relatively high.
   - **Qualitative assessment**: Low likelihood.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Intelligence, understanding abstract concepts, and enjoying solving puzzles align well with computer science.
   - **P(H)**: Computer science is also a popular field for graduate studies, so its prior might be high.
   - **Qualitative assessment**: Moderate to high likelihood.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: A genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals strongly align with this field.
   - **P(H)**: Agricultural and veterinary science might have a lower prior compared to the other fields but has a strong alignment with Adam's personality sketch.
   - **Qualitative assessment**: High likelihood.

Given these qualitative evaluations, I can provide approximate values:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Please note that these values are provided on a qualitative basis and should be refined with actual priors and likelihoods for a precise quantitative analysis.
