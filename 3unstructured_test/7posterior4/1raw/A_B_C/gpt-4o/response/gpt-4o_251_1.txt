To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \), we use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \), which is a normalizing constant.

Without specific numeric values, I'll qualitatively estimate these probabilities based on the provided personality sketch and typical characteristics of graduate students in these fields:

1. **Computer Science**
   - P(E|CS): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are relevant to computer science. Since he has high intelligence, this is a positive indicator for this field but his strong empathy and curiosity about nature aren't strong indicators for computer science.
   - Overall, this might suggest a moderately positive likelihood.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - P(E|AgVet): Adam has a deep love for animals, a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These characteristics align very well with this field.
   - This suggests a high likelihood.

3. **Business Administration**
   - P(E|BA): The sketch mentions empathy and appreciation for hard work, which can be relevant in a leadership or human resources role within business administration. However, there's no direct mention of interest in business practices or administration.
   - This suggests a relatively low likelihood, but not zero.

Given this qualitative assessment, let's estimate the posterior probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values are not from precise numerical data but are derived from the contextual alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical requirements and nature of each field.
