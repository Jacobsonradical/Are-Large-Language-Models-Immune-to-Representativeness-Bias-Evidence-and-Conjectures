To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \) and the prior probability of each hypothesis \( H \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we can only provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch.

Considering the details from the personality sketch of Adam and their relevance to each field:

- **Business Administration**: While high intelligence and appreciation for hard work can be relevant, the strong empathy and love for animals are less directly associated with this field.
- **Computer Science**: High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts fit well, but there is no mention of a specific interest in technology or programming, which are crucial for computer science. 
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: A genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals align closely with this field.

Based on these qualitative assessments, we can infer that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is highest for Agricultural and Veterinary Science and lowest for Business Administration, with Computer Science somewhere in the middle. Assuming a uniform prior probability \( P(H) \) and ignoring extraneous fields, we can provide approximate values:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the provided personality sketch.
