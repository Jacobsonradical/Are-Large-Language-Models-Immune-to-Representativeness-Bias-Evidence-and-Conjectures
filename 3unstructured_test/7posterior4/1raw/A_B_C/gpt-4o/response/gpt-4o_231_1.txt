To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam enrolling in each field (\( P(H) \)), the likelihood of observing the personality traits given each field (\( P(E|H) \)), and the total probability of observing these traits across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the problem doesn't provide specific numerical values for priors and likelihoods, we'll make some reasoned estimates based on the personality sketch provided.

### Prior Probabilities (\( P(H) \))

- **Business Administration**: Popular field but less likely given Adam's traits.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Straightforward match with his love for nature and animals.
- **Computer Science**: Given Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is intelligent in abstract concepts, this field is reasonably likely.

I'll approximate these priors as follows:
- Business Administration: 0.2
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.5
- Computer Science: 0.3

### Likelihoods (\( P(E|H) \))

- **Business Administration**: Adam’s traits seem less aligned with this field. Let’s assign a lower likelihood.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Strong alignment with Adam’s love for nature and animals.
- **Computer Science**: Decent alignment with his problem-solving skills and intelligence.

Let’s approximate these likelihoods:
- Business Administration: 0.1
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.8
- Computer Science: 0.6

### Normalizing Constant (\( P(E) \))

This constant is the sum of the joint probability of observing Adam's traits across all fields:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{BA}})P(H_{\text{BA}}) + P(E|H_{\text{AVS}})P(H_{\text{AVS}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.2) + (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.6 \times 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.02 + 0.4 + 0.18 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 \]

### Posterior Probabilities (\( P(H|E) \))

Now, we compute the posterior for each field using Bayes’ rule:

1. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{BA}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{BA}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.6} \approx 0.033 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{AVS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{AVS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.6} \approx 0.667 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.3}{0.6} \approx 0.3 \]

Summarizing the probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.667,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These posterior probabilities suggest that given Adam's personality traits, it's most likely that he was enrolled in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, reasonably likely in Computer Science, and least likely in Business Administration.
