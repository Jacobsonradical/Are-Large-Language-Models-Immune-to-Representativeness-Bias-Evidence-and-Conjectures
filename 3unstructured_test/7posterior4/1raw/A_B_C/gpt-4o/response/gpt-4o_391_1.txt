To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to follow these steps:
1. Define the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field: this reflects how probable it is for a graduate student to be enrolled in that field without considering specific information about Adam.
2. Define the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given he is in a particular field.
3. Use Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \). Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant, we can omit it and just compare the relative scores.

Given the information available, we will make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods based on the sketch provided:

- Prior probabilities \( P(H) \): These can be informed by general knowledge about graduate enrollment across different fields but are assumed here based on trends.
- \( P(E|H) \): Estimated based on how well the personality sketch matches the typical characteristics and interests associated with each field.

Assumptions:
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.10 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.15 \)
  
Given Adam's interests and attributes:
- Likelihood for Agricultural and Veterinary Science, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high considering his empathy, love for animals, and nature. Let's assume 0.8.
- Likelihood for Computer Science, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) corresponds to his love for puzzles and high intelligence. However, it is neutral to his empathy and love for nature. So, let's assume 0.3.
- Likelihood for Business Administration, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is low, as there is little direct match with his personality traits. Let's assume 0.1.

Using these estimated likelihoods and priors, we will calculate:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H)
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \propto 0.8 \times 0.10 = 0.08
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \propto 0.3 \times 0.30 = 0.09
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.15 = 0.015
\]

Normalizing these (dividing each by the sum of the proportional values):

\[
\text{Sum of proportional values} = 0.08 + 0.09 + 0.015 = 0.185
\]

\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.08}{0.185} \approx 0.432
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.09}{0.185} \approx 0.486
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.015}{0.185} \approx 0.081
\]

So the posterior probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.432,
  "computer science": 0.486,
  "business administration": 0.081
}
