To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) \), we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

In practice, we don’t have specific numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \). However, we can make reasonable qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch and our knowledge of the fields. 

Let's consider the following qualitative assessments:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, given that Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are not strongly aligned with typical characteristics for this field.
   - \( P(H) \): Moderate, as business administration is a common field of graduate study.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, given Adam’s love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work.
   - \( P(H) \): Lower compared to other more commonly pursued fields, but still reasonable.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given Adam’s intelligence and abstract thinking, which align with the skills needed in this field. While his interests in nature and animals don’t directly connect, his problem-solving abilities are relevant.
   - \( P(H) \): High, as computer science is a very popular field among graduate students.

Considering these qualitative assessments:

- \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) (Business Administration):
  - \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is low.
  - \( P(H_{BA}) \) is moderate.
  - So, \( P(H_{BA}|E) \) will be relatively low.

- \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science):
  - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is high.
  - \( P(H_{AVS}) \) is moderate to low.
  - So, \( P(H_{AVS}|E) \) will be relatively high.

- \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) (Computer Science):
  - \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is moderate.
  - \( P(H_{CS}) \) is high.
  - So, \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) will be moderate to high.

The exact numerical values can vary, but we can provide a reasonable range based on these evaluations.

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field based on his personality sketch.
