To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand how Bayes' theorem applies:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that field, and \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch.

Due to the lack of specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and not having exact likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) or the overall probability \( P(E) \), we can only make an educated guess based on how well Adam's personality aligns with typical traits associated with each field.

Given Adam's interests and personality traits:
1. A genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
2. Enjoyment of solving puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts.
5. Appreciation for hard work and dedication.

### Hypotheses Alignment:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Traits like empathy and appreciation for hard work can be present, but the other characteristics don't strongly align. Likelihood is lower.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong alignment with his love for animals, nature, and plants. Also, intelligence and empathy are relevant.
   - High likelihood.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Enjoys solving puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts align well.
   - Moderate to high likelihood.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.35
}
```

These values are chosen to reflect the alignment between Adam's traits and the typical requirements/interests of each field, considering that exact numerical computations aren't feasible without more data.
