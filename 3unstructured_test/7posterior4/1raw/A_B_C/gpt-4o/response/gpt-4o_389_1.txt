To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, business administration) given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the field Adam might be enrolled in).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.

Since we don't have exact data for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we will make reasonable assumptions based on the provided sketch of Adam's personality and typical characteristics of students in these fields. Note that our answers will be qualitative estimates rather than precise probabilities.

### Assumptions

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H_{CS}) \): Graduate fields in the U.S. have a significant number of computer science students. Let's assume moderate prior, say 0.2.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Considering Adam's traits (problem-solving, abstract thinking), it's somewhat likely he could be in this field although the love for nature and animals leans away from it. Let's assume this is low-moderate, say 0.3.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Fewer students might be in this field compared to computer science, but still a reasonable amount. Let's assume a prior of 0.1.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): Adam's love for nature, empathy, and love for animals highly align with this field. So, high likelihood, say 0.8.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior Probability, \( P(H_{BA}) \): Business is a broad and popular field, so assume a reasonable prior, say 0.3.
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Adamâ€™s traits don't strongly suggest a natural fit for business administration. Let's assume low, say 0.2.

4. \( P(E) \) will be the normalizing constant.

### Calculation

We can compute the unnormalized posterior conditional probabilities first:

- \( P(H_{CS}|E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \)
- \( P(H_{AVS}|E) = P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.1 = 0.08 \)
- \( P(H_{BA}|E) = P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \)

These are unnormalized probabilities. Even though we don't calculate the exact value of \( P(E) \) in this qualitative scenario, we won't normalize as required by the problem statement.

### Final Result

So the posterior conditional probabilities are given as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.06,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.08,
  "business administration": 0.06
}
```

The sum doesn't need to be 1 because there could be other fields of specialization.
