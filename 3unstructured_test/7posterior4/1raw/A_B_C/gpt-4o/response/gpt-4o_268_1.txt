To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probability of the subject being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. Since the exact numerical priors and likelihoods aren't provided, we will use educated guesses based on the details given and general knowledge. We'll begin by interpreting the sketch's descriptors in relation to each field.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has strong empathy, a warm heart, and a love for animals.
- He is intelligent and appreciates hard work.

These traits seem to align more closely with certain fields than others:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**: High alignment with curiosity about nature, love for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work.
2. **Computer Science (CS)**: Moderately aligned with intelligence and puzzle-solving abilities but less aligned with nature and animals.
3. **Business Administration (BA)**: Least aligned with attributes related to nature, animals, and puzzle-solving; however, intelligence and empathy can still be useful traits in this field.

Without exact priors, assume general popularity of fields among graduate students, but we will adjust them qualitatively based on alignment with Adamâ€™s personality sketch.

Simplified calculations using qualitative alignment:

Considering:
- Prior probabilities based on graduate enrollment trends:
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.4 \) (CS is a popular field)
  - \( P(\text{BA}) = 0.3 \) (BA is also popular but slightly less so)
  - \( P(\text{AVS}) = 0.3 \) (less popular but fits Adam's profile well)

- Likelihood of Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in each field:
  - \( P(E|\text{CS}) = 0.4 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{BA}) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(E|\text{AVS}) = 0.6 \)

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(\text{H}|\text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E}|\text{H}) \times P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} \]
Where \( P(\text{E}) \) is the same for each hypothesis so it can be treated as a normalizing constant.

Estimates based on qualitative alignment:
{
  "computer science": \( \frac{0.4 \times 0.4}{\text{normalization}} = \text{normalized value} = 0.24 \) 
  "business administration": \( \frac{0.2 \times 0.3}{\text{normalization}} = \text{normalized value} = 0.06 \)
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \( \frac{0.6 \times 0.3}{\text{normalization}} = \text{normalized value} = 0.18\)
}

Since normalization factor ensures all posterior sum to 1, but our totals represent separate probabilities for these scenarios, let's represent them relatively.

So, estimated posteriors could look like:
{
  "computer science": "0.33",
  "business administration": "0.08",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.60"
}

This results in:
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.60
}
