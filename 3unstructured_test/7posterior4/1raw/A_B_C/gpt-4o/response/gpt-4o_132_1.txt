To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we will use Bayes' rule, which is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood, the probability of evidence \( E \).

For simplicity, let's assume the following:
- The priors \( P(H) \) for each field are uniform (i.e., each has an equal chance of being selected before considering the personality sketch).
- The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) will be intuitively assessed based on how well Adam's personality sketch fits each field.

**Intuitive assessment of \( P(E|H) \):**
1. For **computer science**:
    - Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence align with this field.
    - Quiet and appreciation for abstract concepts are neutral traits in this context.
    - Warm heart, empathy, and love for animals are less relevant here.
    - Therefore, let's assign a relatively moderate likelihood: \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \).

2. For **business administration**:
    - Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work could be beneficial.
    - However, the rest of his traits (curiosity about nature, love for animals) are not particularly indicative of business.
    - Therefore, let's assign a lower likelihood: \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.1 \).

3. For **agricultural and veterinary science**:
    - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.
    - Quiet personality and high intelligence can be beneficial in scientific endeavors within this field.
    - Therefore, let's assign a high likelihood: \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.7 \).

Since we assumed uniform priors, \( P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = P(H_{AVS}) \). The marginal \( P(E) \) can be treated as a normalizing constant.

Now we'll calculate the posterior probabilities using normalized values of the likelihoods:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Normalizing the likelihoods:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.7 = 1.2 \]

So the normalized posterior probabilities are:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4}{1.2} \approx 0.33 \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.1}{1.2} \approx 0.08 \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.7}{1.2} \approx 0.58 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.58
}
