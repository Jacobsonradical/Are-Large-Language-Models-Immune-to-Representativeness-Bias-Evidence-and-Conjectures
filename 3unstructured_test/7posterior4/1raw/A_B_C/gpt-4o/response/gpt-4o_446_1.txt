To compute the posterior conditional probabilities, we use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch of Adam, we'll make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods based on his characteristics and their relevance to the fields specified. Note that exact numerical priors and likelihoods are typically derived from actual data, but we'll use qualitative reasoning to estimate relative probabilities here.

### Assumptions:
1. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - \( P(E|BA) \): Modest. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are important, a strong love for animals and nature has less direct relevance.
   - \( P(BA) \): Moderate. Business Administration is a common field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AgVet)**:
   - \( P(E|AgVet) \): High. The strong affinity to nature, plants, and animals perfectly aligns with this field.
   - \( P(AgVet) \): Lower than BA but significant due to fewer students in these specialized fields.

3. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - \( P(E|CS) \): Moderate. High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are highly relevant, though the love for animals and nature is less directly connected.
   - \( P(CS) \): High. Computer Science is a popular and common field.

For P(E), since exact data is not available, we'll treat it qualitatively to evaluate the relative probabilities.

Now let's provide reasonable estimates for the posterior probabilities based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: Lower probability because Adam's profile aligns less with typical BA graduate attributes, especially given his empathy for animals and deep love for nature.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.6)**: Highest probability due to his strong alignment with nature, empathy, and love for animals.
- **Computer Science (0.3)**: Reasonably high due to his intelligence and abstract thinking, though slightly less aligned with his other traits compared to AgVet.
