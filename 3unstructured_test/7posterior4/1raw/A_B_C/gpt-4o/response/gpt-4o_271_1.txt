To utilize Bayes' rule for these calculations, we need to define several probabilities, namely:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents the prior likelihood of Adam being enrolled in each field without knowing his personality sketch.

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.

3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: This is the marginal probability of observing the personality sketch, regardless of the field of study.

Bayes' rule is defined as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, we will assume:
- \( P(H) \) is equal for all fields, i.e., we don't favor any field over another initially (though in reality, this may not be the case).
- The main differentiating factor will be the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), for which we will use qualitative judgment based on Adam's personality sketch.

Let's consider Adam's personality traits and their relevance to each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, a deep love for animals, and a warm heart. These traits align well with the field of Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

2. **Business Administration**: While Adam has high intelligence and appreciation for hard work and dedication, the personality sketch does not directly align with the typical interests and traits associated with Business Administration, which often emphasizes leadership, finance, and organizational skills.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts, which are relevant traits for Computer Science, but his empathy and love for nature and animals are less relevant to this field.

Given this analysis, the likelihoods might be qualitatively judged as follows:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is high,
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is low,
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is moderate.

Since \( P(E) \) is a normalizing constant and the priors are assumed equal, we can focus on the relative likelihoods.

Using this qualitative reasoning:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Note that these values are subjective estimates based on the provided personality sketch and qualitative analysis. For a rigorous calculation, precise prior probabilities and likelihood values would be required.
