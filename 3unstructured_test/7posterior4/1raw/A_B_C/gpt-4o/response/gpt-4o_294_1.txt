To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field (computer science, agricultural and veterinary science, and business administration), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide exact numerical values, we need prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), which are not given in the problem statement. In lieu of precise data, I'll make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and typical associations with each field. 

1. **Computer Science (CS):**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a high intelligence, enjoys solving puzzles, and understands abstract concepts, which are traits beneficial to a career in computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a common field of graduate study, so we'll assume a moderate prior probability.
   - Posterior \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \): Given the traits are frequently aligned with computer science, this probability is expected to be moderate to high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam has a strong curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which are directly aligned with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): This field is less common than others like computer science, so the prior probability might be lower.
   - Posterior \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \): Given the strong alignment with Adam's traits and interests, this probability is expected to be quite high.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits like empathy and understanding hard work are valuable but not specifically indicative of business administration.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Business administration is a common graduate field, so we'll assume a moderate prior probability.
   - Posterior \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \): Since the personality traits do not strongly align with typical business administration traits, the probability might be lower.

Based on these qualitative assessments:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values are based on an interpretation of Adam's personality traits and typical alignments with the fields in question. The actual posterior probabilities would depend on precise prior data and exact likelihoods.
