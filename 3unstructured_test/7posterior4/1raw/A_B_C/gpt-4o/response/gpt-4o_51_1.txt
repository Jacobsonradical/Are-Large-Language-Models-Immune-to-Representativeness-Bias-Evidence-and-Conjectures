To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch if he were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch regardless of the field.

Since we don't have numerical values for these probabilities, we will make qualitative assumptions based on the description provided.

### Assumptions
1. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is moderately high because computer science is a common field of graduate study.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam is intelligent and enjoys solving puzzles, which aligns with the skill set required for computer science, so this is fairly high.
   - \( P(E) \): This is just a constant used for normalization across all hypotheses.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is also moderately high due to the popularity of business administration programs.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's traits such as empathy and warm-heartedness can fit in business administration, but the alignment is not as strong as with computer science or agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, this is moderate.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): This is less common as a graduate field compared to computer science and business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adamâ€™s love for nature, animals, and appreciation for hard work makes this a strong fit. Thus, this is very high.
   
Given these qualitative assumptions, we can hypothesize the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}
```

These values reflect that based on Adam's personality sketch, he is most likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science, followed by computer science, and least likely in business administration.
