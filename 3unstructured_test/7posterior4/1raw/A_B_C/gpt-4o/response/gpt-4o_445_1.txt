To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Adam is in that field.
3. \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor which ensures that the probabilities sum to 1 over all possible fields (though not necessary for this specific calculation as the total across all fields is not required).

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, we must estimate \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) based on Adam’s personality sketch.

Here are qualitative assessments:

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(H) \): Since many students enter business administration programs, this can be considered a fairly common field.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his strong empathy and love of solving puzzles, doesn't strongly align with typical business administration interests.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): A less common field, but directly aligns with Adam's interests and personality traits.
  - \( P(E|H) \): High likelihood given his love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy.

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(H) \): A very popular field among graduate students.
  - \( P(E|H) \): Good match with his high intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles, though his nature and animal interests are less directly aligned.

Given these assessments, let's assign qualitative scores to estimate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ \begin{align*}
P(\text{business administration}|E) &\approx 0.1 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) &\approx 0.7 \\
P(\text{computer science}|E) &\approx 0.2 \\
\end{align*} \]

These values estimate Adam’s likelihood of being in each field given his personality sketch.
