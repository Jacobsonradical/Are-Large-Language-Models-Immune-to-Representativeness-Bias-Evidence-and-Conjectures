To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' Rule, which is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence E.

Since we don't have specific data to fill in these probabilities, I will make reasoned assumptions based on the given personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's deep love for animals, genuine curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.
2. **Business Administration**: Adam’s personality traits, including his quiet nature, empathy, and love for animals, do not directly align with business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.
3. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as enjoying solving puzzles and being good at understanding abstract concepts, which aligns moderately well with computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high.

For simplicity, let’s assume approximate values, acknowledging that these are estimated probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{computer}) = 0.5 \)

Prior Probabilities (assuming equal priors for simplicity):

- \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{business}) = 0.33 \)
- \( P(H_{computer}) = 0.33 \)

Calculating the marginal probability \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \cdot 0.33) + (0.1 \cdot 0.33) + (0.5 \cdot 0.33) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.264 + 0.033 + 0.165 \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.462 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.571 \]
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.071 \]
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.357 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.571,
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "computer science": 0.357
}
