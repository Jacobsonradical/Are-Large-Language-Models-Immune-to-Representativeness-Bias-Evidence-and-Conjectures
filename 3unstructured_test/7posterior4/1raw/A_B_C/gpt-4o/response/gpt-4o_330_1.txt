To calculate the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to understand both the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) and the prior probability \( P(H) \). 

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since it's difficult to obtain accurate priors and likelihoods without empirical data, we will provide reasoned estimates based on the description given. 

1. **Business Administration:**
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \):
        - It seems less likely that a person with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as a preference for puzzles and abstract concepts, would be in business administration compared to the other two fields.
        - Let's estimate this likelihood as relatively low, say 0.05.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \):
        - Graduate students in business administration are common, so let's give this a moderate prior probability, say 0.2.
    
    \[ P(H|E)_{\text{business administration}} \approx \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{P(E)} = \approx \frac{0.01}{P(E)} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):
        - It is highly likely that someone with a genuine interest in nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for hard work is enrolled in this field.
        - Let's estimate this likelihood as quite high, say 0.7.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \):
        - This field is less common than business administration but quite relevant to Adam's interests, so let's give it a somewhat moderate prior probability, say 0.1.
    
    \[ P(H|E)_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} \approx \frac{0.7 \times 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)} \]

3. **Computer Science:**
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
        - Given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, computer science is also quite plausible.
        - Let's estimate this likelihood as moderate, say 0.5.
    - Prior \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \):
        - Graduate students in computer science are quite common, so let's give it a moderate prior probability, say 0.3.
    
    \[ P(H|E)_{\text{computer science}} \approx \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.15}{P(E)} \]

We now need to normalize these probabilities so that they sum to 1. However, since the problem states that the total does not need to add up to 1 due to other fields, we can present the values relatively:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.01,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.07,
  "computer science": 0.15
}
```

These values represent the relative likelihoods based on the given information and assumptions.
