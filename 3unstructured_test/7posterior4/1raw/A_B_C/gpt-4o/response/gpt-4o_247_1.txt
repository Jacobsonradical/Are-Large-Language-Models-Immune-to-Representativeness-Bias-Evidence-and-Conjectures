To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider not just the information given in the sketch \( E \), but also some prior probabilities for each field \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of a hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \).

Since we do not have the exact prior probabilities for each field \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), let's make some informed assumptions based on typical characteristics for these fields and the personality sketch of Adam:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Moderate to high, as business administration is a common field for graduate students.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, as the sketch does not feature typical traits aligned with business administration.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): Lower than business administration but still significant.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, considering Adam’s love for animals, nature, and empathy.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Prior Probability \( P(H) \): High, as computer science is a popular graduate field.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to high, given Adam’s intelligence, abstract reasoning, and love for solving puzzles, though less clearly matching the nature and animal focus.

Based on these qualitative assessments, let's assign some hypothetical values for the probability distributions:

1. **Business Administration**:
    \[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \]
    \[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \text{low} \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[ P(E|H) = 0.7 \]
    \[ P(H) = 0.2 \]
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.2}{P(E)} \approx \text{high} \]

3. **Computer Science**:
    \[ P(E|H) = 0.5 \]
    \[ P(H) = 0.3 \]
    \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \text{moderate} \]

Finally, summarizing these estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.4,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values are rough estimates based on the qualitative assessment of the likelihoods. Note that for precise computations, actual statistical data and prior distributions would be necessary.
