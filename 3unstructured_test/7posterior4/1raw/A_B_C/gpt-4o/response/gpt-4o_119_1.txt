To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \) using Bayes' Rule, we need to understand Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here,

- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \) (what we need).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Since we don't have specific numerical values, I will estimate based on the given personality traits and common characteristics of students in the respective fields.

### Estimating Likelihoods and Priors

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \): Computer science students often possess high intelligence and an affinity for solving puzzles. However, empathy and a deep love for nature/animals are not strongly associated with this field.
   - Prior, \( P(H_{\text{CS}}) \): This field is popular, so a reasonable prior probability.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \): Business students usually exhibit skills in leadership and human interactions, but the quiet, empathetic personality and love for animals is less common in this field.
   - Prior, \( P(H_{\text{BA}}) \): This field is also popular, but less so compared to fields related to technology.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood, \( P(E|H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): Strong match with Adam's love for nature and animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Prior, \( P(H_{\text{AgVet}}) \): This is a more specialized field with a lower general enrollment.

Given the qualitative nature of the input, here are estimated probabilities for each field:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the alignment between Adam's personality sketch and the typical characteristics needed or common in those fields.
