To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of each hypothesis and the likelihood that the personality sketch \(E\) would be observed given that Adam was enrolled in the hypothesized field. However, since we don't have specific numerical values, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on the information given to provide an illustrative example.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define and utilize reasonable assumptions to represent the priors and likelihoods qualitatively for each field.

1. **Computer Science:** 
   - Prior \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior probability is moderate since many students enroll in computer science.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Lower, as the personality traits such as love for animals and nature don't strongly align with typical characteristics of computer science students.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior probability is relatively low since fewer students enroll in this field compared to others.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): High, as the personality traits such as curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with this field.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior \(P(H)\): Let's assume the prior probability is moderate.
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\): Lower to moderate, since the traits listed don't strongly align with typical characteristics of business administration students.

Here is a qualitative approximation using hypothetical values for illustration:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the relative likelihood of Adam's traits fitting each field combined with a general assumption about the popularity of these majors. Note that these values are not statistically derived but are based on logical evaluation of how well the personality sketch matches each field.
