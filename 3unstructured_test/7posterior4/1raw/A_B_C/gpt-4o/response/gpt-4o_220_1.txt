To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since the priors are not given, we'll assume equal priors for simplicity. However, we can still reason about the likelihoods based on Adam’s personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch \( E \), we make qualitative assessments of the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Computer Science (CS):** 
   - Adam has high intelligence and good abstract thinking (positive for CS).
   - However, he has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals (less common in CS).
   - Likelihood score: Medium.

2. **Business Administration (BA):**
   - High intelligence and abstract thinking can be a fit.
   - Empathy and strong appreciation for hard work could be positives.
   - Focus on nature, plants, and animals are less likely to predict interest in BA.
   - Likelihood score: Low.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):**
   - Genuine curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals are strong indicators.
   - Empathy and appreciation for hard work align well with AVS.
   - Likelihood score: High.

Assuming equal priors for simplicity ( \( P(H) \) is the same for all fields), the conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) is roughly proportional to \( P(E|H) \). Normalizing these scores by making sure they sum up to a comparable constant like 1, we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  & \text{Let's denote the likelihood scores as: } L_{CS} = 0.3, L_{BA} = 0.1, L_{AVS} = 0.6\\
  & \text{Total likelihoods sum as: } 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.6 = 1
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the approximate conditional probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values are illustrative based on the qualitative assessment of how well Adam’s personality and interests fit each field, assuming equal priors. In a more precise analysis, we'd use actual enrollment statistics and specific probabilities.
