To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) of each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of the personality sketch given that Adam is enrolled in that field. Generally, without specific prior data for each field, we'll assume the prior probabilities are equal, but we'll heavily rely on the likelihoods derived from the personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's start by assigning subjective likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) based on the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align with this field.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) = 0.8 \).

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment in solving puzzles fit well here.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.6 \).

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's personality traits (empathy, curiosity about nature, love for animals) are less aligned with this field.
   - Let's assign \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.2 \).

Assuming equal prior probabilities \( P(H_{agri\_vet}) = P(H_{CS}) = P(H_{BA}) = \frac{1}{3} \):

The posterior \( P(H|E) \) is proportional to \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \). Since the priors are equal, each posterior \( P(H|E) \) is directly proportional to \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[ P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) \propto P(E|H_{agri\_vet}) \cdot P(H_{agri\_vet}) = 0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Computer Science**:
   \[ P(H_{CS}|E) \propto P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) = 0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

3. **Business Administration**:
   \[ P(H_{BA}|E) \propto P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]

We then normalize these values to convert them into probabilities:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) & \propto 0.267, \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \propto 0.200, \\
P(H_{BA}|E) & \propto 0.067.
\end{align*}
\]

To provide a clearer answer in the required format, we should provide approximate normalized values:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(H_{agri\_vet}|E) & \approx 0.50, \\
P(H_{CS}|E) & \approx 0.38, \\
P(H_{BA}|E) & \approx 0.12.
\end{align*}
\]

However, since we are not normalizing to sum exactly to 1 as requested, we can return the proportional values instead.

The final answer in the required format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

This reflects the likelihoods rather than normalized probabilities, indicating the relative fit of Adam's personality sketch E to each field H.
