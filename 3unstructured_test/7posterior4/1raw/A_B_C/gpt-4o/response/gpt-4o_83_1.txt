To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities for each field, as well as likelihoods that the given personality sketch (E) matches someone enrolled in each of those fields (H).

While specifying exact numerical priors and likelihoods without detailed data is challenging, we can make some educated estimates based on the personality sketch provided and the typical characteristics of students in each field. The personality sketch highlights an interest in nature, plants, animals, puzzles, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts, as well as strong empathy and a warm heart.

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for these values:

- **P(E | business administration)**: The likelihood that someone with Adam's traits is enrolled in business administration might be relatively low, given that his interests seem more aligned with nature and science.
- **P(E | agricultural and veterinary science)**: The likelihood is high since his interests and empathy align well with this field.
- **P(E | computer science)**: The likelihood might be moderate to high due to his intelligence and enjoyment of solving puzzles.

Next, assume some approximate prior probabilities for the distribution of graduate students among these fields without detailed data. For simplicity, let's assume:
- **P(business administration)** = 0.3
- **P(agricultural and veterinary science)** = 0.2
- **P(computer science)** = 0.3
- The sum of these probabilities is 0.8, assuming these are not the only fields.

Together with some guesses for likelihoods:
- **P(E | business administration)** = 0.1
- **P(E | agricultural and veterinary science)** = 0.6
- **P(E | computer science)** = 0.4

We use Bayes' rule: P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
Where P(E) is the marginal likelihood of E, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E | H_i) * P(H_i) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 * 0.3) + (0.6 * 0.2) + (0.4 * 0.3) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.12 + 0.12 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.27 \]

Now calculate each posterior probability:
\[ P(business administration | E) = \frac{0.1 * 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.111 \]
\[ P(agricultural and veterinary science | E) = \frac{0.6 * 0.2}{0.27} \approx 0.444 \]
\[ P(computer science | E) = \frac{0.4 * 0.3}{0.27} \approx 0.444 \]

So the estimates for the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.444,
  "computer science": 0.444
}
```
