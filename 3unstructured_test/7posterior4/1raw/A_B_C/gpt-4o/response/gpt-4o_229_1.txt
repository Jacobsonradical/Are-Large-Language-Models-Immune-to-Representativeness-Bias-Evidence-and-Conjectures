To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we must consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's define the components in the context of our problem:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in that specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch \( E \).

Conducting a precise Bayesian analysis would typically involve comprehensive data about field enrollment rates and personality traits of students in those fields. However, in the absence of exact data, we'll make educated assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Likelihood is relatively high because of Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High because attributes like a warm heart, empathy, and love for animals align well with this field.
   - Approximation: higher probability.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(H) \): Likelihood is moderate because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, particularly with abstract concepts.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate because while puzzle-solving and intelligence are relevant, the empathy and love for nature/animals are less directly related.
   - Approximation: moderate probability.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(H) \): Lower likelihood due to the personality sketch focusing more on empathy, love for nature/animals, and specific academic interests which are less directly aligned with business administration.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low because personality traits such as a love for animals, nature, and a quiet demeanor do not strongly correlate.
   - Approximation: lower probability.

Let's assume base prior probabilities and then adjust based on our likelihood assessment.

Based on educated guesses and the qualitative data provided:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a rough estimation given the alignment of personality traits with the likely fields, but they do not sum to one since other fields may also be considered.
