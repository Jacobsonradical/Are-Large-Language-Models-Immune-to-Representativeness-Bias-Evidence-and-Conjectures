To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \(E\), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

However, we do not have explicit values for the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field or the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) of Adam's traits given each field. We can qualitatively assess these probabilities based on the description provided.

1. **Nature of Adam's Interests and Traits**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants.
   - He has a strong empathy and love for animals.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles and has a high intelligence.
   - He appreciates hard work and dedication.

2. **Assessment**:
   - **Business Administration**:
     - \(P(E|H)\): Low. The described traits do not align strongly with a typical interest in business administration.
     - \(P(H)\): Moderate to high, as business administration is a common field, but less relevant given the traits.
   
   - **Computer Science**:
     - \(P(E|H)\): Moderate to high. Enjoyment of puzzles and high intelligence suggest a fit with computer science.
     - \(P(H)\): Moderate to high, given the popularity of computer science among graduate fields.
   
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
     - \(P(E|H)\): High. Strong fit given his love for nature, plants, and animals.
     - \(P(H)\): Lower than computer science, but still significant due to the specific interests.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can provide rough estimates for \(P(H|E)\) in a relative sense based on the described qualities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

These relative probabilities reflect the alignment of Adam's traits with the likely fields of study. Note that without exact priors and likelihoods, these values are heuristic estimates.
