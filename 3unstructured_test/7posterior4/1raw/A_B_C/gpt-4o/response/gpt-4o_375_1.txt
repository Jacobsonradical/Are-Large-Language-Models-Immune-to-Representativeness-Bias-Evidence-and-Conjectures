To determine the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the given fields, we can use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the information about Adam, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) about Adam's field of study.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Adam was enrolled in each field.
3. \( P(E) \): The overall probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \), which can be considered constant across fields and thus can be ignored for the comparative probabilities.
   
We need to make some reasonable assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \): High, as Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm-heartedness align well with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H_{AVS}) \): Moderate, considering it's a specialized field but still quite relevant.

2. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Moderate, as Adam's solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts fit well, but other characteristics (nature, empathy, love for animals) are not as strongly aligned.
   - Prior \( P(H_{CS}) \): High, given the popularity of this field in graduate studies.

3. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H_{BA}) \): Low to Moderate, as empathy and appreciation for hard work are relevant, but curiosity about nature and love for animals are less aligned.
   - Prior \( P(H_{BA}) \): High, as business administration is a common choice for graduate studies.

Given these estimates, we proceed with the comparative probabilities without needing the exact values for normalization:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values reflect that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is most consistent with a graduate field in Agricultural and Veterinary Science, somewhat compatible with Computer Science, and less so with Business Administration.
