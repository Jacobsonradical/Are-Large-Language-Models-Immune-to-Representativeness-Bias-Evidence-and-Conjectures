To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, given the information available, we don't have explicit values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \). Instead, we'll use qualitative reasoning based on the personality sketch provided.

1. **Business Administration (BA)**:
   - The personality sketch describes Adam as someone who enjoys solving puzzles and has a strong empathy, which could translate to people management skills. However, there is no direct mention of interest or skills in business.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \) might be lower compared to other fields.

   Estimation: 0.1

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS)**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, a deep love for animals, and an appreciation for hard work and dedication. These traits align well with the characteristics needed in the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H_{\text{AVS}}) \) is likely higher.

   Estimation: 0.7

3. **Computer Science (CS)**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is described as having high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which are crucial traits for computer science. However, there is less emphasis on a direct interest in technology itself.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \) would be higher than BA but lower than AVS.

   Estimation: 0.4

Based on these qualitative assessments, our estimates for the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Please note these values are estimates based on qualitative reasoning rather than precise calculations, as complete data for Bayesian inference is not provided.
