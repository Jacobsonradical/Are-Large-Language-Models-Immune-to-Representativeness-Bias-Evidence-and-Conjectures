To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, let's first recall Bayes' rule formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field, \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given the personality sketch \(E\), we can make educated guesses about the likelihood \(P(E|H)\):

1. **Business Administration**: Adam's curiosity about nature, warm heart, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly suggest a business administration focus. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) would be relatively low for business administration.
   
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly suggest that he fits well in this field. The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) would be relatively high for agricultural and veterinary science.
   
3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science. However, the personality sketch does not primarily focus on traits typically associated with computer science students, so the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) might be moderate.

We can only estimate values for these probabilities without actual data:

\[ P(H) \] can be assumed uniform if we have no prior bias towards any field:
\[ P(Business Administration) = P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = P(Computer Science) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Let's estimate \( P(E|H) \):

\[ P(E|Business Administration) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|Computer Science) = 0.2 \]

\[ P(E) \] can be derived from the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|Business Administration) \cdot P(Business Administration) + P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science) \cdot P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science) + P(E|Computer Science) \cdot P(Computer Science) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.333 + 0.7 \cdot 0.333 + 0.2 \cdot 0.333 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.0333 + 0.2331 + 0.0666 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.333 \]

Now apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(Business Administration|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.1 \]
\[ P(Agricultural and Veterinary Science|E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.7 \]
\[ P(Computer Science|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.333}{0.333} = 0.2 \]

Returning this in the requested format:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

Note that these probabilities are illustrative estimates based on the given personality sketch and not actual derived values from data.
