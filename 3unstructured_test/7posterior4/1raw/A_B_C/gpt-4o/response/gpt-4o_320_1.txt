To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \) for each field, it's not possible to compute precise numerical values. Instead, we can provide a qualitative assessment based on the given personality sketch \( E \) and the typical characteristics of each field:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - The personality sketch of Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature, high empathy, and a love for animals, traits which are not strongly aligned with a typical Business Administration track.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) is expected to be relatively low.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with the characteristics needed for success in Computer Science.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is expected to be higher compared to Business Administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a strong interest in nature and animals, which fits exceptionally well with Agricultural and Veterinary Science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) is expected to be the highest.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's denote the conditional probabilities as follows:

- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.05 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx 0.25 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.70 \)

Here's a more structured format of the qualitative conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.70"
}
```

These values reflect the qualitative likelihoods based on the information in the personality sketch \( E \).
