To determine the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch \( P(E) \), we cannot calculate exact numerical probabilities. 

Instead, we can assess how well Adam's characteristics align with each field on a qualitative basis and estimate the relative posterior probabilities accordingly:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  Adam shows a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, strong empathy, and love for animals. These traits are well-aligned with a field that focuses heavily on nature, plants, and animal care.

- **Business Administration:**
  While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit a business administration role, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature are less directly relevant.

- **Computer Science:**
  Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence which aligns with computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals seems less relevant to this field compared to Agricultural and Veterinary Science.

Given this qualitative assessment, the approximate values for the posterior probabilities, although rough, can be as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```
These values reflect a higher alignment of Adam's personality traits with Agricultural and Veterinary Science, a moderate alignment with Computer Science due to his intelligence and love for puzzles, and a lower alignment with Business Administration considering his core personality traits.
