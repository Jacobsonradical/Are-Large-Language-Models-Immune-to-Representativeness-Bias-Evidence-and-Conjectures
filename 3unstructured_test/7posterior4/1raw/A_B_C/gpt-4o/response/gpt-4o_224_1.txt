To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in various fields, we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without knowing the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) (the likelihood of choosing each field without any other information) and \( P(E) \) (the overall likelihood of the personality traits described), we can make qualitative assessments but not precise quantitative calculations. 

Our assessment will rest on the fit between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics and interests associated with each field of study.

1. **Computer Science**
    - Computer science often involves a strong understanding of abstract concepts and problem-solving abilities, which align well with Adam’s intelligence and love for solving puzzles.
    - While computer science involves complex problem-solving that might appeal to Adam, it doesn't particularly align with his love for nature and animals.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
    - This field greatly aligns with Adam’s love for nature, plants, and animals.
    - His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication also fit well with careers in this field.
    - Given his deep love for animals, this field seems like a highly probable match.

3. **Business Administration**
    - Business administration typically requires analytical skills, understanding abstract concepts, and empathy; however, these skills use Adam's traits differently, mainly focusing on business operations and management.
    - While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work could be useful in business, this field seems less aligned with his specific interests in nature and animals.

Thus, qualitatively:

\[
\begin{aligned}
  P(\text{computer science}|\ E) & \text{ likely to be moderate} \\
  P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|\,E) & \text{ likely to be high} \\
  P(\text{business administration}|\,E) & \text{ likely to be low}
\end{aligned}
\]

Assuming equal priors for simplicity and the qualitative fit, a possible breakdown might be:

{
  "computer science": 0.2,  // moderately likely
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,  // highly likely
  "business administration": 0.1  // low probability
}

This is a qualitative approximation based on the specified traits and common associations to the fields. More accurate posterior probabilities would require additional data about the priors and the likelihoods with detailed statistics.
