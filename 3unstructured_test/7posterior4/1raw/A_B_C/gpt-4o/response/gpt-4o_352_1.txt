In order to compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to apply the following formula for each hypothesis \( H \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam, we'll make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods based on typical characteristics associated with each field. 

### Assumptions:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, as Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and understanding of hard work all align closely with this field.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): We'll assume this is moderate because there are fewer students in this field compared to others like business or computer science.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, as his personality doesn't strongly align with the characteristics typically associated with business (e.g., leadership, management, profit-driven mindset).
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Higher than agricultural and veterinary science due to the higher enrollment in business programs.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to high, as his high intelligence, quiet demeanor, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and understanding of abstract concepts fit well.
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Also high due to the high enrollment in computer science fields.

Given these assumptions, let's set approximate values and compute the posterior probabilities:

### Computations:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.7 \)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.1 \)

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

3. **Computer Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H) \approx 0.3 \)

Given that \( P(E) = \sum_{i} P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \), for simplicity, we'll assume \( P(E) \) normalizes the total computed values.

Let's calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.1}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.07}{P(E)}
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.03}{P(E)}
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.3}{P(E)} \approx \frac{0.15}{P(E)}
   \]

Assuming \( P(E) \) normalizes the above ratios to the context:

\[
P(E) = 0.07 + 0.03 + 0.15 = 0.25
\]

So the normalized posterior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.07}{0.25} = 0.28
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.25} = 0.12
   \]

3. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.25} = 0.60
   \]

Therefore, the probabilities are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.28,
  "business administration": 0.12,
  "computer science": 0.60
}
```
