To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need to have data about the prior probabilities of students enrolling in each of these fields and the likelihood of each field given Adam's personality sketch. Given that this detailed statistical information is not provided, I can offer a qualitative reasoning approach to approximate the probabilities.

Bayes' rule is formulated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field given his personality.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam having this personality if he were enrolled in that field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a student being enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of Adam's personality sketch (a constant for all fields in this comparison).

Without exact data, we make plausible assumptions based on Adam's personality traits:
- Adam has a high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles (a good fit for computer science).
- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and a love for animals (a good fit for agricultural and veterinary science).
- A quieter, empathetic nature might not be the direct stereotype for business administration, which sometimes attracts more extroverted and decisive personalities.

Given these qualitative assessments, we can hypothesize relative probabilities. Assume some generic priors and likelihoods based on these insights:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

Here's the qualitative reasoning for these values:
- **Business Administration (0.1):** Adam's personality traits do not strongly align with the typical traits valued in business administration programs.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.5):** His curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals strongly align with this field.
- **Computer Science (0.4):** While Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence (good fits for computer science), his stronger inclination towards nature and animals makes this slightly less probable but still a significant contender.

This qualitative approach helps illustrate the relative likelihoods, though exact numerical probabilities would need statistical data for precise computation.
