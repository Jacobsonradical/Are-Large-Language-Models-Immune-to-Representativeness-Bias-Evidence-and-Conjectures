To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given the personality sketch \( E \) and the hypotheses regarding Adam's field of study, I'll provide qualitative assessments and approximate values for the probabilities. Without specific numerical priors or datasets, these values are reasoned approximations based on the description of Adam.

### Assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Moderate, as computer science is a common field for high intelligence and abstract thinking but not directly tied to empathy or nature/animals.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate to low, as the traits related to nature, animals, and empathy do not directly align with typical computer science traits.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Moderate, business programs are also quite common but usually not linked with a strong empathy or love for animals.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, as Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, and love for animals do not strongly correlate with business administration.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Lower compared to computer science, as fewer students choose this field, but should be higher for Adam given his specific traits.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, as Adam's love for nature, animals, and strong empathy strongly align with this field.

### Qualitative Probabilities:

- Computer Science:
  - Prior: \( P(H) \approx 0.30 \)
  - Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.20 \)

- Business Administration:
  - Prior: \( P(H) \approx 0.30 \)
  - Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.10 \)

- Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  - Prior: \( P(H) \approx 0.10 \)
  - Likelihood: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.60 \)

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for all hypotheses, it does not need to be explicitly calculated for relative comparisons. Normalizing these products will allow us to estimate conditional probabilities.

### Calculations:

1. **Computer Science**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.30 \times 0.10 = 0.03 \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    \[ P(H|E) \propto 0.10 \times 0.60 = 0.06 \]

Normalizing these (proportionality constants removed):

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{computer science}|E) &\approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.06} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.40 \\
P(\text{business administration}|E) &\approx \frac{0.03}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.06} \approx \frac{0.03}{0.15} = 0.20 \\
P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) &\approx \frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.03 + 0.06} \approx \frac{0.06}{0.15} = 0.40 \\
\end{align*}
\]
