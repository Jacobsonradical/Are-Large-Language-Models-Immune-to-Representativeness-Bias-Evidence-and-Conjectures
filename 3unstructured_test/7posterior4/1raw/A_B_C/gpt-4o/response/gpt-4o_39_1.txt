To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each of the fields, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of the evidence given each hypothesis, and the overall probability of the evidence \( P(E) \). Since the exact numerical values for these are not provided, weâ€™ll make some reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: We will assume that the prior probabilities are equal due to lack of specific information.
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **computer science**, the high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts will have moderate relevance.
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**, the curiosity about nature, love for animals, strong empathy, and appreciation for hard work and dedication will have high relevance.
   - For **business administration**, the evidence provided does not strongly correlate with typical characteristics desired in this field.

Given this qualitative assessment, we can assign qualitative likelihoods.

### Calculation:
Given the qualitative nature of these inputs, the results will also be qualitative and represent relative proportions rather than absolute probabilities.

- **Computer Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{cs}) \): Moderate
  - Consequently, the overall \( P(H_{cs}|E) \) will also be moderate.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  - \( P(E|H_{avs}) \): High
  - Consequently, the overall \( P(H_{avs}|E) \) will be high.

- **Business Administration**:
  - \( P(E|H_{ba}) \): Low
  - Consequently, the overall \( P(H_{ba}|E) \) will be low.

Let's assume:
- Moderate Likelihood = 0.4
- High Likelihood = 0.8
- Low Likelihood = 0.2

Thus, the relative proportions (not normalized):

1. **Computer Science**: \( P(H_{cs}|E) = 0.4 \)
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: \( P(H_{avs}|E) = 0.8 \)
3. **Business Administration**: \( P(H_{ba}|E) = 0.2 \)
