To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field without specific evidence.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the evidence given that Adam is enrolled in each specific field.
3. **Normalization Factor** \( P(E) \): The total probability of observing the evidence across all possible hypotheses.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have exact values for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), or \( P(E) \), we will need to make some assumptions based on general knowledge.

### Assumptions
1. **Prior Probabilities** \( P(H) \):
   - There are many graduate fields, but let’s assume some general distribution with a slightly higher prior for computer science due to its popularity.
   - \( P(H_{agricultural}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(H_{business}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_{computer}) = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods** \( P(E|H) \):
   - Based on the personality sketch, Adam’s strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature suggest high \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science.
   - His quiet, puzzle-solving nature might fit well in computer science where abstract concept understanding is beneficial.
   - Business administration seems less likely because it typically requires people and leadership skills, which the evidence doesn’t strongly support.
   - \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{business}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(E|H_{computer}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Normalization Factor** \( P(E) \):
   - Given that we only compare three fields here, we will calculate \( P(E) \) as the sum of the weighted likelihoods of these fields.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural}) + P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business}) + P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer}) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 * 0.1 + 0.1 * 0.15 + 0.7 * 0.25 = 0.08 + 0.015 + 0.175 = 0.27 \]

### Posterior Probabilities
Now, apply Bayes' rule:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{agricultural}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{agricultural}) \cdot P(H_{agricultural})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.1}{0.27} = 0.296 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{business}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{business}) \cdot P(H_{business})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} = 0.056 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{computer}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{computer}) \cdot P(H_{computer})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.27} = 0.648 \]

### Result
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "business administration": 0.056,
  "computer science": 0.648
}
