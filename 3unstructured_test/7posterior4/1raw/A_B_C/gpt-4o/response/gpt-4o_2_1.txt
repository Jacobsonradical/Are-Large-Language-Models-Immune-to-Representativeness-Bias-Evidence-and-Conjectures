Calculating the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule requires knowing the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing the evidence given each hypothesis, and the evidence marginal \( P(E) \). Without concrete data, I'll make informed assumptions based on common distributions for graduate student fields in the U.S. and the given personality sketch.

Given:
- \( E \): Personality sketch of Adam.
- \( H \): Hypothesis for each field of study.
  
Bayes' rule is as follows:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, because \( P(E) \) is consistent across all hypotheses, we'll focus on \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) to compare relative probabilities. Let's break down each part:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assume 5% (since a relatively small portion of graduate students specialize in this field).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): High, because Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals aligns well with this field.

2. **Computer Science**
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assume 20% (a sizeable portion of graduate students are in CS).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, since Adam's puzzle-solving and high intelligence suit CS, but his primary interests in nature and animals don't align as directly.

3. **Business Administration**
   - Prior \( P(H) \): Assume 15% (another common graduate field).
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Low, because Adam's traits and interests in empathy, nature, and abstract concepts are less directly related to business.

Using approximate values and intuition:
\[ P(E|\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \cdot P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}) \approx 0.8 \cdot 0.05 \]
\[ P(E|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\text{Business Administration}) \cdot P(\text{Business Administration}) \approx 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \]

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": \(\approx \frac{0.04}{0.04 + 0.1 + 0.03} \approx 0.23 \),
  "computer science": \(\approx \frac{0.1}{0.04 + 0.1 + 0.03} \approx 0.58 \),
  "business administration": \(\approx \frac{0.03}{0.04 + 0.1 + 0.03} \approx 0.19 \)
}

Therefore, the approximate values normalized for comparison purposes are:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.23,
  "computer science": 0.58,
  "business administration": 0.19
}

These values are indicative and not definitive, given the assumptions made about prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).
