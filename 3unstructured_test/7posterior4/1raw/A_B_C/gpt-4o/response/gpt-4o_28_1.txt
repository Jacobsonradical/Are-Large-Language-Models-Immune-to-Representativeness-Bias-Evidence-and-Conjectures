To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following:

Bayes' rule states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since we are not given explicit values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), let's make reasonable assumptions based on the provided personality sketch of Adam. 

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science would be relatively high.
   - The prior \( P(H) \) might be lower as this field is less common compared to other disciplines.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. This aligns well with the typical skill set required in computer science, implying a relatively high \( P(E|H) \).
   - Computer science is a common field, so the prior \( P(H) \) would be moderate.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - The description doesn't strongly align with a typical business administration student, suggesting a lower \( P(E|H) \).
   - However, business administration is a common field, hence a moderate to high \( P(H) \).

Let's assign qualitative probabilities based on these assumptions. For simplicity, we'll assume:

- \( P(E) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant and is the same across all fields for rough comparison purposes.

Here's an approximate conditional posterior probability distribution:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These values reflect the likelihoods inferred from the personality sketch and assumed priors for these particular fields. Note that these are rough estimates and actual probabilities would require more precise data.
