To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will qualitatively estimate them based on the provided information about Adam's personality sketch (E).

### Step-by-step approach for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants and a deep love for animals, which align well with this field.
    - **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: Moderate to high, as many students are enrolled in this field.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: High, given that his interests and personality traits match this field very closely.
    - **Posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)**: High.

2. **Computer Science:**
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which align with some aspects of computer science.
    - **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: High, as computer science is a very popular field among graduate students.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Moderate, as his traits do match some aspects but not as closely as agricultural and veterinary science.
    - **Posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Moderate.

3. **Business Administration:**
    - Adam has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication, which are valuable in business administration. However, his empathy and love for animals and nature do not directly align with the core interests of this field.
    - **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**: High, as business administration is also a popular field among graduate students.
    - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: Low to moderate, as his personality traits do not strongly indicate this field.
    - **Posterior probability \( P(H|E) \)**: Low to moderate.

### Estimated Posterior Probabilities:
Based on the qualitative assessment:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values are purely estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with each field of specialization.
