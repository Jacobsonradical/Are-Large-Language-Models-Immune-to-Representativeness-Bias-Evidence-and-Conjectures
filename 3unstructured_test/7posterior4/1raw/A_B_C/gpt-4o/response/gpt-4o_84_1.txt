Bayes' Rule can be formally written as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we do not have detailed prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) for each hypothesis (graduate field), we will make a qualitative assessment based on how well Adam's personality traits and interests fit each field.

Let's analyze each field in turn:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which are favorable traits for computer science.
   - Abstract concepts understanding aligns well with computer science, but there is no direct evidence of interest in technology or computers.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Strong empathy and appreciation for hard work are helpful in business.
   - However, there is no direct evidence of interest in economic or business-related activities.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals which directly aligns with this field.
   - Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication are also indicative of someone who might be suited for agricultural and veterinary science.

Based on this qualitative assessment, let's assign probabilities in an intuitive but reasoned way:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values represent the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch fits each field, with the highest probability assigned to agricultural and veterinary science due to its direct alignment with his interests and traits.
