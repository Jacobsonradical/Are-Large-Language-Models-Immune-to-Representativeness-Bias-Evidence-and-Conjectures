To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities, \( P(H|E) \), where \( H \) denotes the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in a specific field and \( E \) is the personality sketch of Adam, we need to apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we don't have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each of the fields, we can make some informed guesses based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a "genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants," a "warm heart," and a "deep love for animals," which aligns very well with this field.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as a "quiet boy who enjoys solving puzzles" and is of "high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts." This description fits characteristics often associated with computer science students.

3. **Business Administration**: The personality sketch emphasizes empathy, appreciation for hard work, and intelligence, which are important for business administration, but the other characteristics (nature, plants, animals) are less directly relevant.

Let's assign subjective probabilities based on these qualitative assessments:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Since this field strongly aligns with Adam's love for nature and animals, we can assign a higher probability.
2. **Computer Science**: Given Adam's intelligence, puzzle-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts, this field is also a strong contender.
3. **Business Administration**: Although possible, this field does seem less likely given the strong emphasis on nature and animals in the personality sketch.

Based on this, the subjective probabilities might look like:

```
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are subjective and are intended to represent the relative likelihoods given the available personality sketch. Real probabilities would require concrete data on the likelihood of these traits within each field and the priors regarding Adam's enrollment.
