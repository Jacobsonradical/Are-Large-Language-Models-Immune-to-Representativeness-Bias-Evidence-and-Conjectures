To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we must consider the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of evidence \( E \), which can be seen as a normalizing constant.

Without specific prior probabilities and likelihoods, assumptions will be made based on common knowledge and logical inferences aligned with the personality sketch provided.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: High, given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and empathy.
   - **P(H)**: Moderate, as this field is less common compared to fields like business administration but still significant.
   - Hence, **P(H|E)** will be relatively high.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate to low, given Adam's interest in puzzles and intelligence. However, this field does not align perfectly with his love for animals and nature.
   - **P(H)**: High, considering the large number of students enrolled in computer science fields.
   - Hence, **P(H|E)** might be moderate.

3. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Low, since Adam's empathy, love for nature, and animals do not align well with business administration.
   - **P(H)**: High, given the popularity of business administration.
   - Hence, **P(H|E)** will be relatively low.

Assuming even distributions and subjective judgment, the approximations are as follows:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are hypothetical and should be taken as rough estimates:
- \(P(H|E)\) for "agricultural and veterinary science" is higher due to the better match with Adam's personality traits.
- \(P(H|E)\) for "computer science" is moderate given his puzzle-solving skills and intelligence.
- \(P(H|E)\) for "business administration" is lower due to a less direct match with his traits.
