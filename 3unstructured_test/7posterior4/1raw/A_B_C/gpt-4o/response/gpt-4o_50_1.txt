To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to express Bayes' rule mathematically as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), exact numerical values are impossible to determine accurately. Instead, I will provide qualitative estimates based on the given personality sketch.

Below are the qualitative posterior conditional probabilities assuming some reasonable general assumptions about Adam's field of study based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",  // Low likelihood given Adam's curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals doesn't align well with business administration.
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",  // High likelihood as Adam's interests in nature and animals strongly align with this field.
  "computer science": "0.3"  // Moderate likelihood given Adam's interest in solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts.
}

This is a qualitative assessment based on the information from the personality sketch and typical characteristics associated with each field.
