To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule for the given fields, we need to combine prior probabilities for each field with the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) based on the hypothesis \( H \).

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in computer science.
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(\text{business administration}) \) as the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in business administration.

The likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) can be interpreted based on how well the characteristics in Adam's personality sketch fit with the typical attributes of a student in those fields.

### Assumptions:
1. **Prior Probabilities \( P(H) \)**: These can be assumed to be the relative proportions of students enrolled in each field as graduate students in the U.S.
   - Let's assume equal priors for simplicity: each field has an initial probability of 1/3.

2. **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - Computer Science: Given Adam's traits, such as high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and understanding abstract concepts, \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) is relatively high.
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's love for nature, animals, empathy, and hard work support a high \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \).
   - Business Administration: While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for dedication might fit, other attributes such as curiosity about nature and empathy are less characteristic for this field, making \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) lower.

Let's assume the following likelihood values for simplicity:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.3 \)

### Calculation:

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the total probability \( P(E) \) is the same normalization factor for all fields, we don't need to compute it explicitly, just need to compute the numerator and compare ratios.

```json
{
  "computer science": "0.6 * 1/3 / normalization_factor",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8 * 1/3 / normalization_factor",
  "business administration": "0.3 * 1/3 / normalization_factor"
}
```

So:
- Computer Science: \( 0.6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.2 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.267 \)
- Business Administration: \( 0.3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.1 \)

Normalization factor \( = 0.2 + 0.267 + 0.1 = 0.567 \)

This gives:
\[ P(H|E_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{0.2}{0.567} \approx 0.353 \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{0.267}{0.567} \approx 0.471 \]
\[ P(H|E_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{0.1}{0.567} \approx 0.176 \]

Final Answer:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.353,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.471,
  "business administration": 0.176
}
```
