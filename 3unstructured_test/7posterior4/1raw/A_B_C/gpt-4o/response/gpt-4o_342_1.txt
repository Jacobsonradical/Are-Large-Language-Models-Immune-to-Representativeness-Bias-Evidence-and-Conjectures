To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch E given he is in a particular field H (P(E|H)) and the prior probability P(H) of Adam being in that field without any personality information.

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that P(E) is constant for all hypotheses, we can focus on the numerator for relative comparison among the fields. P(E|H) represents how likely Adam's personality characteristics are given that he is in that field. P(H) is the prior probability of a graduate student being in that field, for which we need to use general knowledge about the distribution of graduate students across fields or make an informed assumption.

However, without specific data to exactly quantify these probabilities, we can make qualitative estimates based on the descriptions and coherence between fields and Adam’s personality sketch.

Here's a qualitative assessment based on the provided sketch:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, along with a warm heart and empathy, strongly aligns with this field. People in this field often have a deep understanding of natural environments and animal welfare. Hence, P(E|H) is high for this field.
2. **Computer Science**: Adam’s intelligence and problem-solving abilities fit well with Computer Science, but the direct link to nature and animals is weaker. P(E|H) is moderate.
3. **Business Administration**: This field generally emphasizes leadership, management, and strategic planning skills. Adam’s personality doesn't show a direct inclination toward these aspects. Thus, P(E|H) is relatively low.

Assuming a rough equal prior distribution for graduate enrollment, let's assign indicative values:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.2
}

These values provide a comparative probability that aligns with Adam’s personality traits.
