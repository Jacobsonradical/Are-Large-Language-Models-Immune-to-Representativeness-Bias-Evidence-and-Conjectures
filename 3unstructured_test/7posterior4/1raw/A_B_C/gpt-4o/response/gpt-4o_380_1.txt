To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities of each hypothesis \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While exact numerical values for the prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information about Adam's personality and interests.

Let's break down each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants and a deep love for animals. This aligns well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - This would increase \( P(E|H_{agricultural}) \).

2. **Business Administration:**
   - While Adam has a high intelligence and appreciation for hard work, the data does not strongly suggest an interest in business administration.
   - This lowers \( P(E|H_{business}) \).

3. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts, which are important traits for computer science.
   - This would moderately increase \( P(E|H_{computer}) \).

Without specific prior probabilities or exact likelihoods, we can only qualitatively reason the posterior probabilities. Hence, we make educated guesses based on alignment with Adam's personality sketch.

Let's use qualitative reasoning for our estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values reflect that:

- Adam's interests and personality traits strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science (hence a higher probability).
- Adam's traits and interests do not align much with business administration (hence a lower probability).
- Adam's puzzle-solving skills and appreciation for abstract concepts somewhat align with computer science (hence a moderate probability). 

Note that these estimates are subjective since we do not have precise numerical data for \( P(H) \), \( P(E|H) \), and \( P(E) \).
