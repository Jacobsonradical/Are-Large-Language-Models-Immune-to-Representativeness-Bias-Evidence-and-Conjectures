To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we first need the prior probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, and the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given each field. However, since the prior probabilities and detailed likelihoods are not provided in the sketch, I'll rely on a qualitative interpretation based on Adam's personality traits.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we'll make educated assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - His personality fits well with this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - There is no specific evidence in the personality sketch suggesting a strong interest in business concepts or management.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and abstract concepts, which are significant in computer science.
   - His strong intelligence is a good fit for this field.

Given these qualitative assessments and without precise probabilities, here are the estimated posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are purely illustrative and based on the qualitative match between Adamâ€™s traits and the expected demands and interests of each field. In a more rigorous analysis, we would need actual prior probabilities and likelihoods.
