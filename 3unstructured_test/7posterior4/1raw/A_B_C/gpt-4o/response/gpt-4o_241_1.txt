To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in one of the fields. Bayes' rule is defined as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here, \( P(E) \) serves as a normalizing factor to ensure the probabilities sum to 1 across all hypotheses. While we do not have precise statistical data, we can qualitatively estimate the relation between Adam's personality and his field of study.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Priors \( P(H) \)**:
  - We can assume that the prior probability for each field depends on general enrollment statistics for those fields. Hypothetically, let's assume:
    - \( P(H_{CS}) = 0.3 \) (Computer Science)
    - \( P(H_{AVS}) = 0.15 \) (Agricultural and Veterinary Science)
    - \( P(H_{BA}) = 0.25 \) (Business Administration)

- **Likelihoods \( P(E|H) \)**: This indicates how well Adam's personality matches a typical student in each field.
  - **Computer Science**: Adam's intelligence and problem-solving skills match this field. However, empathy and a love for animals might not be strong indicators. So, we assign a moderate likelihood.
    - \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.4 \)
  - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are highly aligned with this field.
    - \( P(E|H_{AVS}) = 0.8 \)
  - **Business Administration**: Adam's abstract understanding and appreciation for hard work are relevant, but other traits are less aligned.
    - \( P(E|H_{BA}) = 0.3 \)

### Normalization:
\( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.3) + (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.315 \]

### Posteriors \( P(H|E) \):

- **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{0.315} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.381 \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.315} \]
\[ P(H_{AVS}|E) \approx 0.381 \]

- **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.315} \]
\[ P(H_{BA}|E) \approx 0.238 \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.381,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.381,
  "business administration": 0.238
}
