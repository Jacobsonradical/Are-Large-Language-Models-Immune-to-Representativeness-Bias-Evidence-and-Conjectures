To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the specified fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (evidence).

Given the personality sketch of Adam, let's consider:
- \( P(E|H) \): The probability of Adam's personality sketch given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \): The general likelihood he is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \): Common to all evaluations and acts as a normalization factor.

Since explicit numerical priors and likelihoods are not provided, we'll need to make reasonable estimates:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - While computer science might require strong analytical skills and mathematical aptitude (aligning with Adam's intelligence and abstract thinking), it does not strongly correlate with his love for nature, empathy, or animals.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Business skills often align with strong communication, leadership, and strategic thinking rather than empathy, nature interest, and puzzle-solving, which seem less emphasized.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - This field aligns strongly with Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's make approximate estimates:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

These values reflect a higher probability for Agricultural and Veterinary Science due to its stronger alignment with Adam's described traits.
