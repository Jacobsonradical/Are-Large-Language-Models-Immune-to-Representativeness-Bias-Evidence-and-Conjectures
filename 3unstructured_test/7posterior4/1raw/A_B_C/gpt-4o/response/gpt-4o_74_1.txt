To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to understand the basic components of the rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in this case, exact mathematical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \) are not directly given. Instead, we'll use qualitative reasoning based on Adam's personality sketch and field characteristics to provide a qualitative estimate.

Given the evidence \( E \) (Adam's personality sketch), we'll evaluate the likelihood of each field \( H \). Here's a qualitative reasoning for each:

1. **Computer Science:** 
   - High intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well.
   - Quietness and enjoyment of solving puzzles also align well.
   - Lower match in terms of curiosity about nature and love for animals. 

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Strong match with Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals.
   - Warm heart and empathy often align with careers involving animal care.
   - Slightly weaker match in terms of abstract concepts understanding (but not irrelevant).

3. **Business Administration:**
   - High intelligence is a plus.
   - Understanding of hard work and dedication aligns somewhat.
   - However, this field generally does not align strongly with curiosity about nature, love for animals, or the personal satisfaction seen in puzzles-solving.

Based on these considerations:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(\text{Computer Science}|E) & \approx 0.2 \\
P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) & \approx 0.5 \\
P(\text{Business Administration}|E) & \approx 0.1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, we can present our approximations as:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

These values are based on a qualitative reasoning approach given the lack of explicit prior and likelihood values.
