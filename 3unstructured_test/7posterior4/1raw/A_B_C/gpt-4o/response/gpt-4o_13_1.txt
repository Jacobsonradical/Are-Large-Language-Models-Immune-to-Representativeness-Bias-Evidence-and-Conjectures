To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we'll use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given \( H \) (that Adam is enrolled in the given field).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (the proportion of graduate students enrolled in the given field).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of \( E \) (the probability of observing evidence \( E \) across all fields).

Given that we do not have specific numerical values for the prior probabilities or likelihoods, we'll make some reasonable qualitative assessments based on the personality sketch.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and skill in understanding abstract concepts suggest a potential fit. However, nothing explicitly ties his interests or empathy for animals and nature to computer science.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, given his intelligence and puzzle-solving skills.
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate prior for this common field.
   - Result: The probability will be moderate but not exceptionally high due to the lack of explicit alignment with his other characteristics.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for dedication point directly towards this field.
   - \( P(E|H) \): High, since these traits align strongly.
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a lower prior compared to more common fields like computer science.
   - Result: The posterior probability will be high due to the strong alignment of interests and personality traits.

3. **Business Administration**: While intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts can be relevant, there isnâ€™t much in the personality sketch that directly aligns with business or management.
   - \( P(E|H) \): Low, given the lack of direct connection.
   - \( P(H) \): Assume a moderate prior due to the popularity of the field.
   - Result: The probability will be relatively low.

Here are the qualitative probabilities:

{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

These values are illustrative and based on qualitative assessments rather than precise numerical data. The posterior probabilities reflect the alignment between Adam's personality and interests with typical characteristics of each field.
