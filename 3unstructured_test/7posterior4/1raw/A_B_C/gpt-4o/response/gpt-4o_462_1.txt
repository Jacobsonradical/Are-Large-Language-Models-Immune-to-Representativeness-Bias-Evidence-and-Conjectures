To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we can only make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch (E) of Adam. Let's break down our assessments based on the given fields:

1. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with typical attributes required for business administration, such as leadership, strategic thinking, and economics-related interests. Therefore, P(E|H) for this field might be lower.
   - Assuming the base rate (P(H)) of students in business administration is moderate in the graduate student population.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam is described as intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts, enjoys solving puzzles, and has curiosity. These are attributes that fit well with computer science.
   - Assuming the base rate (P(H)) of students in computer science is high among graduate students.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam's love for animals, interest in nature and plants, and empathy align well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Assuming the base rate (P(H)) of students in this field is moderate to high among graduate students.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the estimated posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Business Administration (0.1)**: The alignment between Adam's traits and the characteristics needed for business administration is weak, thus a lower probability.
- **Computer Science (0.6)**: Adam has several traits that align well with computer science, making this a likely field.
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7)**: Given Adam's specific interests and characteristics, this field appears to be the most aligned with his personality sketch.

Remember these are qualitative estimates rather than precise probabilistic calculations.
