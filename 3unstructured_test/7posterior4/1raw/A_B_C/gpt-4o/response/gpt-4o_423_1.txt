To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, the prior probability of each hypothesis, and the evidence itself. Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without explicit prior probabilities and likelihoods, we'll make some educated guesses based on the given personality sketch of Adam and typical characteristics of different fields of graduate study.

To simplify things, let's make qualitative assessments of how well Adam's personality and interests match each field.

### Business Administration
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Solving puzzles: Moderate relevance (strategy and problem-solving)
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low relevance
- High intelligence, abstract concepts: Moderate to high relevance
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work: High relevance

### Computer Science
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Low relevance
- Solving puzzles: High relevance (logic, algorithms)
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Low to moderate relevance (less direct impact)
- High intelligence, abstract concepts: Very high relevance
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work: High relevance

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Curiosity about nature and plants: Very high relevance
- Solving puzzles: Moderate relevance (problem-solving in research and practice)
- Warm heart, empathy, love for animals: Very high relevance
- High intelligence, abstract concepts: High relevance
- Understanding and appreciation for hard work: Very high relevance

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the posterior probabilities in a normalized fashion:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

These values reflect the relative fit of Adam's personality sketch with each field. Adam's strong fit with agricultural and veterinary science is suggested by his love for nature and animals, while his puzzle-solving and intelligence make computer science a good fit, albeit less so than agricultural sciences. Business administration is the least fitting based on the available personality traits.
