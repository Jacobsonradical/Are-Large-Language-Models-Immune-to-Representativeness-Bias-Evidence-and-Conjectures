To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have some information on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, as well as the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) that Adam's personality sketch would be observed given that he is in a particular field. However, these exact prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided in the question, so we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_3 \) as the hypothesis that Adam was enrolled in business administration.

To estimate the posterior probabilities, \( P(H_i|E) \), for each of these hypotheses given the personality sketch \( E \), we'll qualitatively assess the compatibility of each field with Adam's described traits.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly resonate with this field. This suggests a high likelihood that his personality sketch \( E \) would be observed if he were in this field.

2. **Computer Science**: Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence in understanding abstract concepts fit well with this field. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly related, which may slightly lessen the likelihood compared to the first field.

3. **Business Administration**: While Adam's empathy and appreciation for hard work would be beneficial in business administration, the specificity of his interests in nature, plants, animals, and solving puzzles suggests a lower likelihood that his personality sketch would be observed if he were in this field.

Given these qualitative assessments, we'll assign subjective probabilities, recognizing these are not computed from exact prior and likelihood values but inferred from the provided context.

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.10
}

These values reflect the compatibility of Adam's personality traits with each field of study based on the provided sketch.
