To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis, along with the prior probabilities of each field. However, since we do not have actual data for prior probabilities or exact likelihoods, my answer will be qualitative rather than quantitative. Nevertheless, I will provide inferred probabilities based on the given personality sketch.

Bayes' rule states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For simplicity, I will make some reasonable assumptions about the relative prior probabilities and likelihoods for each field based on Adam's described personality:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, and he has a deep love for animals. These traits align strongly with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high.
   - Assuming a moderate prior probability for this field, \( P(H) \).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Adam's personality traits, particularly his love for animals and nature, do not directly align with business administration.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is likely low.
   - Given the wide range of business fields, the prior probability is moderate, but the alignment with his interests is weak.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has strong intelligence for abstract concepts, which aligns with computer science.
   - Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is likely moderate.
   - The prior probability of a graduate student being in computer science is relatively high in the current educational landscape.

Given these qualitative assessments, here are the inferred probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values represent a reasoned guess based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the typical characteristics and interests associated with each field.
