To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider both the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of specialization and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field. Since specific prior probabilities are not provided, we will assume that the prior probability for each field is equal for simplicity, and focus on the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

Bayes' rule can be stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We'll assume that \( P(E) \) is constant across all evaluations, allowing us to focus on the numerator:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H)P(H) \]

Given Adam's personality sketch, we assess the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) as follows:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - High likelihood that someone with a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals would be enrolled in this field.
   - Empathy and love for animals strongly match characteristics desirable in this field.
   - Abstract thinking and intelligence are beneficial but less specific to this field.

2. **Business administration:**
   - Less likely given Adam's personality sketch; little in the sketch suggests a strong alignment with typical business administration interests.
   - No specific metrics suggest that empathy, strong love for animals, or nature curiosity directly support this field.

3. **Computer science:**
   - Abstract thinking and intelligence align well with the field.
   - While problem-solving is relevant, not much else in Adam's sketch (love for animals, empathy, nature curiosity) directly supports a strong likelihood for computer science, though it doesn't preclude it.

Considering these evaluations, we can estimate the likelihoods as follows, normalizing under an assumption of equal prior probabilities:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - Very high fit based on interests and personality: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \)
2. **Business administration**:
   - Low fit based on personality sketch: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \)
3. **Computer science**:
   - Moderate fit based on problem-solving skills and abstract thinking: \( P(E|H) \approx 0.4 \)

Here are the posterior conditional probabilities, following the assumed proportional relationship indicated earlier:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.67,
  "business administration": 0.08,
  "computer science": 0.25
}

Please note that this estimation is based on heuristic evaluation of personality traits and their alignment with assumed field characteristics. With exact prior probabilities and more detailed field-specific data, more precise values could be computed.
