To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the fields given the personality sketch of Adam, we need to use Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that Adam was enrolled in the field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he was enrolled in the field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a random graduate student is enrolled in that field.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing Adam's personality sketch.

Since we don't have exact numerical values for these probabilities, I'll make a qualitative assessment based on the personality sketch and the stereotypical attributes of students in each field. I’ll assume that Adam’s qualities are more aligned with certain fields and less with others, and provide probabilities on this basis. 

Here's the estimated fit of Adam to each field based on the personality sketch:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam’s deep love for nature, plants, and animals, and his understanding and appreciation for hard work, this field aligns closely with his interests and personality. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is high.
2. **Computer Science**: Although Adam has high intelligence and enjoys solving puzzles, which are relevant to computer science, his strong connection to nature and animals makes this less likely.
3. **Business Administration**: This field usually requires a different set of interests and skills, such as a focus on economic strategies and leadership, which do not seem to align well with his personality sketch.

Assigning rough qualitative probabilities based on the alignment of the personality sketch:

\[ P(H|E) \]
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
