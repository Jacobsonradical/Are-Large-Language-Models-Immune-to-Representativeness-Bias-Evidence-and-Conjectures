To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we must determine:

1. The prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field, which represents the proportion of graduate students typically enrolled in that field.
2. The likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which represents how likely it is for a student in that field to fit the personality sketch \( E \).

Unfortunately, I don't have specific numerical data for these prior probabilities or detailed likelihood values. However, I can qualitatively reason through the problem to provide approximate answers based on the information given.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has high intelligence and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He appreciates hard work and dedication.

Let's break this down for each field and assess the likelihood qualitatively:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts fit well here.
   - Enjoyment of puzzles also aligns with a common interest in computer science.
   - However, Adam's curiosity about nature and love for animals might not be as directly relevant.
   - Assume: \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is moderate to high depending on the emphasis on problem-solving skills.
   - \( P(H_{CS}) \) might be relatively high due to the popularity of the field.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - A genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals directly relate.
   - Strong empathy and warm heart fit well with this career focus.
   - Assume: \( P(E|H_{AVS}) \) is high because the personality traits match strongly.
   - \( P(H_{AVS}) \) might be lower overall compared to computer science but relevant.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - High intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply here.
   - Appreciation for hard work and dedication aligns well.
   - However, the specific interest in nature, love for animals, and empathy might be less directly relevant.
   - Assume: \( P(E|H_{BA}) \) is moderate.
   - \( P(H_{BA}) \) might be moderate to high due to the popularity of the field.

Without specific numerical priors and likelihoods, accurate quantitative computation isn't feasible. However, qualitatively:

{
  "computer science": "0.3 - 0.5",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.5 - 0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2 - 0.4"
}

These ranges indicate that while Adam has attributes that could fit any of these fields, his particular interest in nature and animals tilts the probability higher towards Agricultural and Veterinary Science. Adjustments would be necessary with real data for precise values.
