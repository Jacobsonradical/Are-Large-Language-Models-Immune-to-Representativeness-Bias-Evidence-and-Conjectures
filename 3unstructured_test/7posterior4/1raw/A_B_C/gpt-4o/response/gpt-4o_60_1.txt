To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each of the specified fields using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider both the likelihood of observing the personality traits \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \) and the overall prior probabilities of each field. Bayes' Rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for the different fields and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we must make reasonable qualitative assumptions based on the given personality sketch \( E \). 

### Assumptions
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Higher, given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, his love for animals, and strong empathy.
   - Prior Likelihood \( P(H) \): Reasonable for graduate students.

2. **Business Administration**: 
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Lower, as there are no direct personality traits pointing towards this field.
   - Prior Likelihood \( P(H) \): Generally high for graduate students, but not specifically supported by the personality sketch.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Moderate, considering his intelligence and enjoyment of puzzles, which are compatible with computer science.
   - Prior Likelihood \( P(H) \): Reasonable for graduate students.

Considering these qualitative insights, we provide the following conditional probabilities as approximate values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

Here, the values reflect a qualitative estimation based on how well Adam's personality traits align with each field. Without detailed numeric data, these probabilities serve as reasonable assumptions rather than precise calculations.
