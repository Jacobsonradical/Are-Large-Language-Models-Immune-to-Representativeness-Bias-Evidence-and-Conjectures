To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of each field and the likelihood of E given H. However, since the priors (P(H)) and likelihoods (P(E|H)) are not provided in the problem, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch provided.

### Assumptions:

1. **Prior Probabilities (P(H)):**
   Let's assume that there is an equal probability for a graduate student to be enrolled in each of these fields.
   - P(H_CS) = P(H_AVS) = P(H_BA) = 1/3

2. **Likelihoods (P(E|H)):**
   Based on the personality sketch E:
   - Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of being in agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with computer science.
   - The characteristics mentioned do not strongly correlate with business administration, so we will assume a lower likelihood for this field.

### Estimates:
- P(E|H_CS) = 0.4 (consistent with understanding abstract concepts)
- P(E|H_AVS) = 0.6 (highly consistent with love for animals and nature)
- P(E|H_BA) = 0.2 (less consistent with provided traits)

### Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_CS) \cdot P(H_CS) + P(E|H_AVS) \cdot P(H_AVS) + P(E|H_BA) \cdot P(H_BA) \]

### Calculations:

#### P(E):
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.4 + 0.6 + 0.2}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{1.2}{3} \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 \]

#### P(H_CS|E):
\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{0.4 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{0.4}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_CS|E) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(H_CS|E) ≈ 0.33 \]

#### P(H_AVS|E):
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{0.6}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{0.6}{3} \cdot 2.5 \]
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = \frac{1.5}{3} \]
\[ P(H_AVS|E) = 0.5 \]

#### P(H_BA|E):
\[ P(H_BA|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_BA|E) = \frac{0.2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{0.4} \]
\[ P(H_BA|E) = \frac{0.2}{3} \cdot 2.5 \]
\[ P(H_BA|E) ≈ \frac{0.5}{3} \]
\[ P(H_BA|E) ≈ 0.17 \]

### Final Probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.33,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.17
}
```

Note that the sum of these probabilities is 1, which is expected in the case where these are the only possible fields. This harmonizes with the idea that the distribution of probable fields should account for total probability.
