To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to assess:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
However, without the exact numerical values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we will make qualitative assessments based on the provided personality sketch and common perceptions about the likelihood of Adam being in each field given his characteristics. Here's a reasonable qualitative approach to estimating these probabilities:

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - He enjoys solving puzzles, which is a skill often beneficial in computer science.
   - However, there's no specific mention of an interest in technology or programming.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals.
   - His warm heart and strong empathy align well with careers in veterinary science.
   - His understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align well with this field.

3. **Business Administration**: 
   - There are no specific attributes in the personality sketch that align closely with the skills or interests typically associated with business administration (such as interest in management, finance, economics, etc.).

Given these qualitative assessments, let’s provide educated guesses for the posterior conditional probabilities:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{computer science} & : \text{0.3} \\
\text{agricultural and veterinary science} & : \text{0.6} \\
\text{business administration} & : \text{0.1} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the results would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are based on the alignment of Adam’s personality traits with the typical attributes and interests of individuals in these fields, assuming equal prior probabilities for simplicity.
