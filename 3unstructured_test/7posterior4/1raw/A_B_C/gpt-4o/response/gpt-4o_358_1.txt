To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of specialization given Adam's personality sketch, we'll use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

For this scenario, we need to consider how well Adam's personality sketch \( E \) matches the typical characteristics of students in each field \( H \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 
    - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and strong empathy. These characteristics strongly correlate with this field.
    - Hypothetically, let's assign a high likelihood \( P(E|H_{agriculture\_vet}) \approx 0.8 \).
    - Let's assume the general prior probability \( P(H_{agriculture\_vet}) \approx 0.1 \) based on typical graduate student distribution.

2. **Computer Science**: 
    - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, which are traits often seen in computer science students. However, the strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals is less aligned.
    - Hypothetically, let's assign a moderate likelihood \( P(E|H_{comp\_sci}) \approx 0.5 \).
    - Let's assign a higher prior probability \( P(H_{comp\_sci}) \approx 0.3 \).

3. **Business Administration**: 
    - Adam's characteristics such as strong empathy can be beneficial in business administration, but other traits like curiosity about nature and love for animals are less relevant.
    - Hypothetically, let's assign a lower likelihood \( P(E|H_{bus\_admin}) \approx 0.2 \).
    - Let's assign a typical prior probability \( P(H_{bus\_admin}) \approx 0.2 \).

Let's summarize \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) \approx \sum P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.8 \times 0.1) + (0.5 \times 0.3) + (0.2 \times 0.2) \approx 0.08 + 0.15 + 0.04 = 0.27 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|E) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{agriculture\_vet}|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.1}{0.27} \approx \frac{0.08}{0.27} \approx 0.296 \]

2. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{comp\_sci}|E) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.3}{0.27} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.556 \]

3. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{bus\_admin}|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2}{0.27} \approx \frac{0.04}{0.27} \approx 0.148 \]

Therefore, the posterior conditional probabilities are approximately:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.296,
  "computer science": 0.556,
  "business administration": 0.148
}
