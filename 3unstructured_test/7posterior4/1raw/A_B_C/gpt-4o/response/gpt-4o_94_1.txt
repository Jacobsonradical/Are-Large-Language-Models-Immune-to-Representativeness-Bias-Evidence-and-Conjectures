To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch E of Adam, we can use Bayes' Rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this context:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in a given field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given the field of study.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the personality sketch (which normalizes the probabilities but can be bypassed since we're comparing relative probabilities).

Since we do not have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each of these fields, we can assume them to be reasonably uniform for simplicity, or assign rough estimates based on commonality of the fields. However, it's more tractable to compare the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \).

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
   - He has a deep love for animals.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) = high.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - The personality traits shown do not strongly align with typical business administration interests.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) = low.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and is good at understanding abstract concepts.
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) = moderate to high.

Given these observations, we can now assign estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```

These values are estimates based on the alignment of Adam's personality sketch with the typical interests and traits associated with each graduate field of study.
