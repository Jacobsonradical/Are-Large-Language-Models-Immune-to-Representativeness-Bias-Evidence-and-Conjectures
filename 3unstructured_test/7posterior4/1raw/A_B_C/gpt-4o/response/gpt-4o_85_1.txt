To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field and the likelihood of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given each hypothesis \( H \). The formula for Bayes' rule in general is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, since we are not given explicit prior probabilities or likelihoods, we can only qualitatively assess the probabilities based on our understanding of how well Adam's personality sketch aligns with typical characteristics of students in each field. 

Given:
1. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
2. Adam enjoys solving puzzles.
3. Adam has a strong empathy and a deep love for animals.
4. Adam is highly intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Adam has an appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Now, let's assess each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Enjoying solving puzzles and high intelligence aligns well with computer science.
    - Curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals are not specifically aligned but not entirely irrelevant.
    - Appreciation for hard work is a general trait that matches many fields.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - High intelligence and understanding abstract concepts are relevant.
    - Empathy and a warm heart might be beneficial in management positions, but these traits are not specific indicators.
    - Not directly aligned with curiosity about nature or love for animals.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Strong alignment with curiosity about nature, various plants, and a deep love for animals.
    - Empathy is particularly relevant in veterinary science.
    - Appreciation for hard work and dedication is very relevant.
    - Enjoying solving puzzles could be applicable given the problem-solving nature of scientific and veterinary work.

Based on this analysis, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note: The values are qualitatively assigned based on the alignment of Adam's personality traits with the typical characteristics required or desirable in each field. These are subjective estimates rather than precise calculations due to the lack of explicit priors and likelihoods.
