To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to:

1. Determine the prior probabilities \(P(H)\) for each field.
2. Estimate the likelihood \(P(E|H)\) for each field given Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' rule is given by:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability.
- \(P(E)\) is the evidence (normalizing constant).

Since we lack the exact numerical data for prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will rely on reasonable estimations based on typical characteristics and interests of students in each field.

### Estimations:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - Prior probability \(P(H_{CS})\): Computer Science is a common field for graduate study in the U.S.
     Estimation: \(P(H_{CS}) \approx 0.25\)
     
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{CS})\): Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, qualities which align well with computer science.
     Estimation: \(P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.5\)

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Prior probability \(P(H_{AVS})\): Less common than Computer Science but still a notable field.
     Estimation: \(P(H_{AVS}) \approx 0.15\)
     
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{AVS})\): Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, there is a strong alignment with this field.
     Estimation: \(P(E|H_{AVS}) \approx 0.8\)

3. **Business Administration:**
   - Prior probability \(P(H_{BA})\): Another common field for graduate study.
     Estimation: \(P(H_{BA}) \approx 0.25\)
     
   - Likelihood \(P(E|H_{BA})\): Adamâ€™s qualities such as empathy and understanding the value of hard work align somewhat with business administration but not as directly as with the other fields.
     Estimation: \(P(E|H_{BA}) \approx 0.3\)

### Normalizing Constant \(P(E)\):

\[P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS}) + P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})\]

\[P(E) = (0.5 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.25)\]

\[P(E) = 0.125 + 0.12 + 0.075\]

\[P(E) = 0.32\]

### Posterior Probabilities:

1. **Computer Science:**

\[P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.25}{0.32} = \frac{0.125}{0.32} \approx 0.391\]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

\[P(H_{AVS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AVS}) \cdot P(H_{AVS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.32} = \frac{0.12}{0.32} \approx 0.375\]

3. **Business Administration:**

\[P(H_{BA}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.25}{0.32} = \frac{0.075}{0.32} \approx 0.234\]
