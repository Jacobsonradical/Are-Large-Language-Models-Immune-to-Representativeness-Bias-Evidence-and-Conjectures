To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, let's start by expressing Bayes' rule in the context provided:

$$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} $$

For each field of study, we need to estimate the conditional probabilities. Since specific numerical values are not provided for each, we must make educated guesses based on the personality sketch \( E \) of Adam.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
    - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This might be relatively low because agricultural and veterinary science might enroll a smaller fraction of graduate students.
    - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm-hearted empathy, this field seems quite relevant. \( P(E|H) \) would be high.
    - **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: High
    
    Estimation:
    $$ P(H|E) \approx 0.30 $$

2. **Computer Science:**
    - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This field has a larger enrollment in graduate programs.
    - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, which fits well with computer science. However, his curiosity about nature and love for animals aren't directly relevant.
    - **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: Moderate
    
    Estimation:
    $$ P(H|E) \approx 0.20 $$

3. **Business Administration:**
    - **Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**: This field also has a relatively high enrollment in graduate programs.
    - **Likelihood, \( P(E|H) \)**: Adam’s traits don't strongly suggest a fit for business administration. The empirical data given doesn't align closely with this discipline.
    - **Posterior Probability, \( P(H|E) \)**: Low
    
    Estimation:
    $$ P(H|E) \approx 0.05 $$

Here’s the resulting estimated posterior probabilities in the requested format:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.30,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
