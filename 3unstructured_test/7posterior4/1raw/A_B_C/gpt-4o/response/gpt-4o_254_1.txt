In order to use Bayes' Rule to compute the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for each hypothesis \(H\), we need to determine the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihood \(P(E|H)\), and the normalizing constant \(P(E)\). For simplicity, we will assume that each field is equally likely a priori.

Let’s represent the fields with the following code for brevity:
- \(H_1\) for agricultural and veterinary science
- \(H_2\) for business administration
- \(H_3\) for computer science

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H_1)\)**: Let's assume for simplicity that graduate students are equally distributed among these fields, so \(P(H_1) = \frac{1}{3}\).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_1)\)**: Adam’s love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy strongly aligns with agricultural and veterinary science. Thus, \(P(E|H_1)\) would be high. Assume \(P(E|H_1) = 0.8\).

2. **Business Administration**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H_2)\)**: Similarly, \(P(H_2) = \frac{1}{3}\).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_2)\)**: Business administration does not necessarily align strongly with Adam’s interests and personality traits. Thus, \(P(E|H_2)\) would be quite low. Assume \(P(E|H_2) = 0.1\).

3. **Computer Science**:
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H_3)\)**: Similarly, \(P(H_3) = \frac{1}{3}\).
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H_3)\)**: Adam’s intelligence, good problem-solving skills, and understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science, though not as strongly as with agricultural and veterinary science. Assume \(P(E|H_3) = 0.6\).

To find the posterior probabilities, we use Bayes’ Rule:
\[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Where \(P(E)\) is the normalizing constant:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) + P(E|H_3) \cdot P(H_3) \]

Calculating \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) + (0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}) \]
\[ P(E) = \frac{0.8}{3} + \frac{0.1}{3} + \frac{0.6}{3} = \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \]

Now, calculating the posterior probabilities:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.8/3}{0.5} = \frac{0.8}{1.5} = 0.533 \]
\[ P(H_2|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.1/3}{0.5} = \frac{0.1}{1.5} = 0.067 \]
\[ P(H_3|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.6/3}{0.5} = \frac{0.6}{1.5} = 0.4 \]

Hence, the posterior probabilities \(P(H|E)\) are:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533,
  "business administration": 0.067,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
