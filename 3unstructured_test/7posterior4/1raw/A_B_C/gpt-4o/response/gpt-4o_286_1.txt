To calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components:

1. **P(H)**: The prior probability of each hypothesis (field of study).
2. **P(E|H)**: The likelihood of observing the evidence (personality sketch) given each hypothesis.
3. **P(E)**: The overall probability of the evidence.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since the exact probabilities are not provided for these priors and likelihoods, we need to make some educated assumptions based on the information given.

### Assumptions:

1. **P(H)**: Assume equal prior probabilities for each field of graduate study since we have no specific information suggesting otherwise.
   \[ P(\text{business administration}) = P(\text{computer science}) = P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **P(E|H)**: These are subjective estimates based on the provided personality sketch.
   - **Business Administration**: People in this field may not typically require the curiosity about nature, empathy, and love for animals described in the sketch. Likelihood can be assumed to be lower.
   - **Computer Science**: Analytical ability and intelligence fit well with this field, but interest in nature and plants is less relevant.
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly aligns with nature, plants, animals, empathy, and dedication described.

3. **P(E)**: The total probability of the evidence, which normalizes the probabilities. Since we're performing a comparative analysis, \( P(E) \) remains a common factor and can be disregarded for relative estimation in this context.

Given these assumptions:
- **P(E|business administration)**: Low probability due to less alignment with the given traits.
- **P(E|computer science)**: Medium probability due to partial alignment (problem-solving, intelligence).
- **P(E|agricultural and veterinary science)**: High probability due to strong alignment with empathy, dedication, nature, plants, and animals.

### Posterior Probabilities:

Given that we are making an educated guess without actual empirical data, the posterior conditional probabilities can be represented as:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Note: These values are estimated for illustration purposes based on subjective judgment and logical reasoning given the evidence (E). Actual probabilities would require more detailed data or expert insights from those specific fields.
