To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to have prior probabilities and likelihoods. Without specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, we will have to make qualitative assessments based on the given personality sketch. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_B) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in business administration.
- \( P(H_A) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( P(H_C) \) as the prior probability of Adam being enrolled in computer science.

The hypothesis \( H \) can be:
- \( H_B \): Adam was enrolled in business administration.
- \( H_A \): Adam was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_C \): Adam was enrolled in computer science.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Based on the personality sketch \( E \), we will qualitatively assess the likelihood terms \( P(E|H_B) \), \( P(E|H_A) \), and \( P(E|H_C) \). 

For \( H_B \) (business administration):
- Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy do not strongly align with typical characteristics associated with business administration. Thus, \( P(E|H_B) \) can be considered low.

For \( H_A \) (agricultural and veterinary science):
- Adamâ€™s interest in nature, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work strongly align with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H_A) \) can be considered high.

For \( H_C \) (computer science):
- Adam's love for puzzles and high intelligence with understanding abstract concepts aligns well with computer science. Thus, \( P(E|H_C) \) can be considered moderate to high.

With these qualitative assessments:
\[ P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given a lack of specific prior probabilities, we can use our qualitative assessments to inform our posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5
}
```

Here, the values denote our qualitative assessment:
- "business administration": Low likelihood based on personality sketch, so 0.1.
- "agricultural and veterinary science": High likelihood based on personality sketch, so 0.7.
- "computer science": Moderate to high likelihood based on personality sketch, so 0.5.

Note that these values are for illustrative purposes given the qualitative nature of our assessment. For more accurate probabilities, actual prior probabilities and likelihood values would be needed.
