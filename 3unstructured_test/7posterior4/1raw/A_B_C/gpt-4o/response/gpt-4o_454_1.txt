To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence \( E \).

Given that we do not have specific priors or likelihoods, we will need to make some reasoned assumptions based on the given personality sketch.

Let’s break it down for each field:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with computer science.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Popular field, so a significant proportion of students are in this field.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's strong empathy and appreciation for hard work might be useful in business administration.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Very popular field, so it also has a considerable proportion of students.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants strongly align with this field.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Less common than computer science or business administration but very aligned with Adam’s interests.

Without exact numbers, any precise calculation is an approximation. However, we can still make reasoned comparisons.

Let’s assign reasonable values assuming that the total probability among all possible graduate fields is 1. To reflect the alignment of Adam's traits with these fields, we hypothesize:

- For **Computer Science**, which aligns moderately well:
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx 0.3
  \]

- For **Business Administration**, which aligns less well:
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx 0.1
  \]

- For **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**, which aligns very well:
  \[
  P(H|E) \approx 0.5
  \]

Here are the probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5
}
```

Please note that these are estimated probabilities based on the alignment of the given personality sketch with the characteristics commonly associated with each field. For precise probabilities, detailed data on priors and likelihoods would be necessary.
