To compute the posterior probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields given his personality sketch (E), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of Adam being in a specific field given his personality (the posterior probability).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Adam being in each specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing Adam's personality overall (the evidence).

Since we do not have specific data on the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \), we need to qualitatively estimate these based on common knowledge and the personality traits described.

1. **Business Administration**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Individuals in this field may develop strong people skills, but Adam's profile doesn't inherently match the typical business administration traits (e.g., leadership focus, business strategy).
   - **Prior (P(H))**: Moderate, as many people study this field.
   - **Overall**: Low to moderate probability.

2. **Computer Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam has high intelligence, curiosity, and enjoys solving puzzles which align well with computer science.
   - **Prior (P(H))**: Moderate, as computer science is a common field of study.
   - **Overall**: Fairly high probability.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - **P(E|H)**: Adam has a strong affinity for animals and nature, which very closely aligns with this field.
   - **Prior (P(H))**: Less common than the other fields, but relevant to his interests.
   - **Overall**: High probability.

Given the above qualitative reasoning, we can propose the following estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Note that these values are based on qualitative estimations matching Adam's personality with the typical traits associated with these fields, without exact quantitative data.
