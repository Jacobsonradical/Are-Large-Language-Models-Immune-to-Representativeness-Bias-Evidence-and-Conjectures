To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability of each hypothesis (field of study) before considering the evidence \( E \).
2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: The probability of observing the evidence given each hypothesis.
3. **Evidence \( P(E) \)**: The overall probability of the evidence across all hypotheses.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

While it's impractical to compute exact values without comprehensive data, we can make educated assumptions based on the information given:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam’s deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and plants directly align with this field.
2. **Business Administration**: There isn’t much in the personality sketch that strongly correlates with typical business administration interests.
3. **Computer Science**: Adam's inclination towards solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts align with skills needed in computer science.

We’ll make reasonable assumptions for the priors and the likelihoods:

- **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Assume each field has an equal prior probability of 0.33.
- **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
  - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: High likelihood, say 0.7.
  - Business Administration: Low likelihood, say 0.1.
  - Computer Science: Moderate likelihood, say 0.6.

Using Bayes' rule, if we denote the total evidence \( P(E) \) as the sum of all likelihoods weighted by their priors:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{Ag}})P(H_{\text{Ag}}) + P(E|H_{\text{Bus}})P(H_{\text{Bus}}) + P(E|H_{\text{CS}})P(H_{\text{CS}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.33) + (0.1 \cdot 0.33) + (0.6 \cdot 0.33) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.231 + 0.033 + 0.198 = 0.462 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \) for each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{Ag}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Ag}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Ag}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.5 \]

2. **Business Administration**:
\[ P(H_{\text{Bus}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{Bus}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{Bus}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.071 \]

3. **Computer Science**:
\[ P(H_{\text{CS}}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{CS}})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.33}{0.462} \approx 0.429 \]

Therefore, based on the above calculations:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.071,
  "computer science": 0.429
}
