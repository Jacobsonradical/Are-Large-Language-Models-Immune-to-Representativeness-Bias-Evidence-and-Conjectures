To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we will use the formula:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the likelihood of being enrolled in a given field before considering personality sketch E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the personality sketch E given that the hypothesis H is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing the personality sketch E.

For simplicity, since we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E) \), we will qualitatively reason the probabilities based on the given personality sketch of Adam.

1. **business administration**: Given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, it is less likely that he is enrolled in a business administration program, as these traits are not strongly associated with this field.

2. **agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam's interest in nature and animals, as well as his empathy and appreciation for hard work, strongly suggest that he could be enrolled in this field. 

3. **computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and understands abstract concepts well, which are good indicators for computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals does not strongly align with computer science, making it a less likely but still possible field.

Given these considerations, here are the qualitative posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```

These values are not definitive but reflect a reasonable estimation based on the provided personality sketch.
