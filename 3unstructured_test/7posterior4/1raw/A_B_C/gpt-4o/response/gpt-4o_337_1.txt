To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), the prior probability \( P(H) \), and the evidence \( P(E) \). Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Due to the lack of specific numerical data, we'll provide qualitative reasoning for approximate values. We'll assume the prior probabilities reflect typical enrollment rates in various graduate fields and consider how Adam's personality aligns with them.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns very well with this field. His strong empathy and love for animals are also a match.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** This field is less common compared to business administration or computer science.
   - **Evidence \( P(E) \):** Adam's traits are greatly aligned with this field.

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.70
   \]

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, traits that align well with computer science. His understanding of abstract concepts is also a good fit.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Computer science is a common field of study among graduate students.
   - **Evidence \( P(E) \):** Several but not all of Adam's traits align with this field, especially the affinity for nature and animals.

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.20
   \]

3. **Business Administration:**
   - **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):** Adam's traits do not strongly align with business administration. While appreciation for hard work and dedication can be important, there is no specific mention of skills such as leadership or strategic thinking.
   - **Prior \( P(H) \):** Business administration is among the most common fields for graduate students.
   - **Evidence \( P(E) \):** Adam's given traits are less relevant for business administration.

   \[
   P(H|E) \approx 0.05
   \]

Combining these, we get:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.70,
  "computer science": 0.20,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
