To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam (E), we need to use Bayes' rule, which is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Adam is enrolled in a particular field given his personality sketch.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of Adam's personality traits given that he is in a particular field.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in that particular field.
- \( P(E) \) is the normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum up to 1 across all possible fields.

Without specific numerical values for the probabilities, I will provide a qualitative assessment based on the described traits and the plausibility of Adam being in each field.

1. **Computer Science**: 
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with the field of computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might not be as relevant.
   - \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field among graduate students.
   - Combining these factors, the posterior probability might be lower due to the misalignment of many of his traits but still non-negligible.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s strong empathy and understanding of hard work and dedication could be beneficial in business administration; however, his love for nature, animals, and solving puzzles doesn't closely align with typical traits needed in business.
   - \( P(H) \): Business administration is also a common field among graduate students.
   - Therefore, the posterior probability may also be lower.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and warm heart strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science.
   - \( P(H) \): This field is less common than computer science or business administration but still has a significant enrollment base.
   - Hence, the posterior probability is likely higher due to strong alignment with his personality traits.

Given these qualitative assessments, here's an approximate ranking of probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.55
}
```

These values represent a qualitative analysis of the likelihoods based on the provided traits. For a more precise calculation, specific numerical values for prior distributions and likelihoods would be required.
