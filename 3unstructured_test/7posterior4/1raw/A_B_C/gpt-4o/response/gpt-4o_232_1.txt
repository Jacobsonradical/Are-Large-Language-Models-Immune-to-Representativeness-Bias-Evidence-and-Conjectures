Applying Bayes' rule requires knowledge of several probabilities that we don't have from the given information. However, we can reason about qualitative aspects and make heuristic estimates based on the personality sketch of Adam. 

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We don't have the exact prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the conditional probabilities \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E) \). Still, we can make educated guesses based on the description.

1. **Computer Science**: Adam is described as someone who enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with good understanding of abstract concepts, traits beneficial in computer science. However, his strong empathy, warm heart, and deep love for animals suggest a more nature-oriented field might be more suitable for him. Thus, while possible, it seems less likely compared to other fields.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and a deep love for animals, which directly aligns with this field. His empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication further support this alignment.

3. **Business Administration**: This field doesn’t clearly align with the personality traits described. It typically requires an interest in management, economics, and business strategies. Adam’s traits do not strongly indicate such interests.

Given these considerations, we can heuristically estimate the posterior probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.05
}
```

These values reflect that, given the personality sketch provided, Adam is most likely to be in agricultural and veterinary science, less likely to be in computer science, and least likely to be in business administration.
