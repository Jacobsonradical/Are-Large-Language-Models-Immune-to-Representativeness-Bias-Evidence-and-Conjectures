To calculate the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' Rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field of graduate study and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), which is the probability of E given H. Since we do not have exact prior probabilities or likelihoods, we will make reasonable qualitative assessments based on Adam's personality sketch.

Bayes' Rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We will estimate \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \):

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- **Prior (P(H))**: Moderately likely. Fewer students choose this field compared to some others, but it suits Adam's interests.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: High. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work align well with this field.

### Business Administration
- **Prior (P(H))**: High. Business administration is popular among graduate students.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Low. Adam's personality sketch (interest in nature, empathy, abstract thinking) does not strongly align with typical traits associated with business administration.

### Computer Science
- **Prior (P(H))**: High. Computer science is a very common field for graduate students.
- **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Moderate. Adam is intelligent and good at understanding abstract concepts, which fits with computer science. However, his interest in nature and animals is less relevant.

Now we combine these qualitative assessments to give a rough estimate for \( P(H|E) \):

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}
```

These values are qualitative estimates based on the personality sketch provided.
