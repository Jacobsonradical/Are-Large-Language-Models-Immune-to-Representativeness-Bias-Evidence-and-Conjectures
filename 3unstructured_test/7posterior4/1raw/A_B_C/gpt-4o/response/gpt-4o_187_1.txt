To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we use the formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Since we do not have specific values for these probabilities, we’ll need to make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch and the fields of study.

1. **Likelihoods, \( P(E|H) \)**
   - **Computer Science**: Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align with skills often found in this field. Probability: 0.3
   - **Business Administration**: Adam's warm heart and empathy might align less with business administration, although the appreciation for hard work and dedication could align with it. Probability: 0.1
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's curiosity about nature, strong empathy, and deep love for animals align strongly with this field. Probability: 0.6

2. **Prior Probabilities, \( P(H) \)**
   Given the diversity of fields, let’s assume the following prior distribution based on common graduate fields:
   - **Computer Science**: 0.3
   - **Business Administration**: 0.3
   - **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: 0.1

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(E) \)**
   This can be computed based on the sum of the likelihoods weighted by their respective priors:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.3 \cdot 0.3) + (0.1 \cdot 0.3) + (0.6 \cdot 0.1) = 0.09 + 0.03 + 0.06 = 0.18
   \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:

1. **Computer Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}|E) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.3}{0.18} = \frac{0.09}{0.18} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Business Administration**:
   \[
   P(\text{Business Administration}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.3}{0.18} = \frac{0.03}{0.18} \approx 0.167
   \]

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \[
   P(\text{Agricultural and Veterinary Science}|E) = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.1}{0.18} = \frac{0.06}{0.18} \approx 0.333
   \]

Thus, the posterior probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.167,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.333
}
```
