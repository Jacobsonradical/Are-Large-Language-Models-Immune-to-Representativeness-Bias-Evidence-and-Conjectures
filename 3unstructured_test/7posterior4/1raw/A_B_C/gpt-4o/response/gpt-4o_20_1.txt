To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field of graduate study, we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

In this case:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Adam is enrolled in a specific field.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood that Adam's personality sketch \( E \) is observed given he is in a specific field.
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, calculated as the sum of the likelihoods for all possible fields. Since we are only comparing among three fields here, \( P(E) \) can be simplified as the sum of \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for those specific fields.

Without specific data on prior probabilities and likelihoods, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on general knowledge and Adam's traits. However, note that accurate computation would require detailed statistical data which is not provided here. Therefore, these are heuristic estimates.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**

   - Likely high \( P(E|H) \) because Adam has a love for nature, plants, and animals.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) might be lower compared to some other fields, since this is a specialized field.
   
2. **Business Administration:**

   - Likely low \( P(E|H) \) given Adam's interests and personality traits do not match typical business administration students.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) might be higher due to the high number of business students, but this doesn’t match Adam’s personality.

3. **Computer Science:**

   - Moderately high \( P(E|H) \). Adam’s interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence fits well with computer science.
   - Prior \( P(H) \) might be high considering computer science is a common and popular field.
  
Given this, here are heuristic estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.60",
  "business administration": "0.10",
  "computer science": "0.30"
}
```

These values are subjective estimates given the data available. For precise probabilities, statistical data on enrollment and personality traits correlation would be necessary.
