To compute the posterior conditional probability P(H|E) for each field given the personality sketch of Adam, we use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide specific numerical estimates, we need prior probabilities P(H) for each field, likelihoods P(E|H), and the overall probability P(E). In the absence of specific quantitative data, we can make qualitative assessments based on your provided personality sketch of Adam.

We can make the following assumptions based on Adam's personality sketch:
1. Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy suggest a strong likelihood for "agricultural and veterinary science."
2. Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts might indicate some probability for "computer science."
3. Business administration seems less likely, as there is no specific mention of interests or traits that align closely with that field.

Assuming all other fields have a negligible probability, we can make reasonable assumptions to qualitatively estimate the posterior probabilities.

Based on the provided personality sketch and considering the likely interests and traits:
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{agriculture}) \) is high.
- \( P(E|H_{computer\_science}) \) is moderate.
- \( P(E|H_{business}) \) is low.

Now we denote these assumptions in qualitative terms between 0 and 1.

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values are educated guesses based on the provided personality sketch. For precise computation, we would need actual statistical data on the distribution of students' interests across fields and their alignment with personality traits.
