To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \). However, we are not provided with specific prior probabilities or likelihood values. Instead, we need to rely on intuition and the information from Adam's personality sketch to estimate these probabilities qualitatively.

Given the personality sketch \( E \):
- Genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals
- High intelligence and good at abstract concepts
- Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication
- Quiet and enjoys solving puzzles

Let's analyze each field:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - Strong match with Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - High probability given the specific alignment with his interests and empathy.

2. **Business Administration**:
   - Not strongly aligned with Adamâ€™s described interests or personality traits. No specific mention of business-related attributes.
   - Lower probability since the personality traits do not correlate closely with typical motivations for pursuing business studies.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - High intelligence, good at abstract concepts, quiet, and enjoys solving puzzles, all align well with computer science.
   - Moderate to high probability given these specific attributes aligning with typical traits of computer science students.

So, the qualitative analysis would roughly give us:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "computer science": "0.5"
}

These values are estimates based on qualitative alignment and should be refined with actual prior probabilities and likelihoods if they become available.
