To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to use the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(E|H) \), \( P(H) \), and \( P(E) \), we can only qualitatively assess the probabilities. Given Adam's personality sketch (E), we can make educated guesses about the likelihood of him being enrolled in each field.

- **Computer Science**: Given Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts, he may have some fit for computer science. However, his strong empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might be less directly aligned with this field.

- **Business Administration**: Adam's empathy and warm heart are traits that could be beneficial in business administration, particularly in roles focused on people or social enterprises. However, his love for animals and nature does not directly suggest a higher likelihood for this field.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field closely aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Based on this qualitative assessment:
- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) would be relatively high,
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) would be lower, and
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) would be intermediate.

Thus, assuming \( P(H) \) (initial probability of each hypothesis being true before considering the evidence) might be uniform for lack of better knowledge, we can infer the posterior probabilities qualitatively:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values reflect the fit of Adam's personality and interests with each field based on the given information about him.
