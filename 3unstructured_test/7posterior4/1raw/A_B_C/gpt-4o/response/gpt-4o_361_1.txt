To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we also need prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), which measure how likely we are to observe Adam's personality sketch given that he is enrolled in a particular field.

While precise mathematical probabilities might require detailed data on typical personality traits in each field, we can make educated estimates based on the compatibility of Adam's personality sketch with these fields.

**Bayes' Rule** states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given \( P(E) \) is constant across all hypotheses, comparing \( P(H|E) \) boils down to comparing \( P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \) for each field.

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**
   - **P(H)**: Generally lower enrollment compared to fields like computer science and business administration.
   - **P(E|H)**: High likelihood, given his love for nature, plants, animals, and appreciation for dedication.
   - **P(H|E)** would be significantly high due to strong alignment.

2. **Computer Science**
   - **P(H)**: High, since computer science is a popular field.
   - **P(E|H)**: Moderate, although he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, the rest of his interests don't strongly align with typical computer science frameworks.
   - **P(H|E)** would be moderate to low.

3. **Business Administration**
   - **P(H)**: High, as it is also a popular field among graduate students.
   - **P(E|H)**: Low, given Adam's personality, which leans more towards empathy, nature, and animals rather than typical business-oriented traits.
   - **P(H|E)** would be relatively low.

These considerations give us the following rough estimates:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science, suggesting it aligns best with Adam's described personality traits.
