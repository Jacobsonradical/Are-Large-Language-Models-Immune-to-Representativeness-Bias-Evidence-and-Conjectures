To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probability \( P(H) \), the likelihood \( P(E|H) \), and the evidence (normalizing constant) \( P(E) \). However, in the absence of specific numerical data for these factors, we will make qualitative estimates based on the information provided in the personality sketch and the general characteristics of each field.

Using Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we don't have specific numerical probabilities, we can make educated guesses based on Adam's attributes and how strongly they align with each field. We'll reason qualitatively:

1. **Agricultural and veterinary science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is high because Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals.
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) for this field among graduate students might be moderate.
   - Overall, we expect a relatively high posterior probability.

2. **Computer science:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is moderate because Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence for abstract concepts, which are relevant skills in computer science.
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) for computer science is likely high, given its popularity among graduate students.
   - Overall, we expect a moderate posterior probability.

3. **Business administration:**
   - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low because the personality sketch highlights empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature, which are less directly relevant to business administration.
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) for business administration is also relatively high, given its popularity.
   - Overall, we expect a lower posterior probability compared to the other fields.

Based on these qualitative estimates, the posterior probabilities can be roughly outlined as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These are qualitative guesses rather than precise calculations and should be interpreted as such. The values sum up to more than 1, as you noted, acknowledging there are other fields not evaluated here.
