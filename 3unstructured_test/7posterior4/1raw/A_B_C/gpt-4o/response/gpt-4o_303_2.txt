Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) is proportional to the prior probability \(P(H)\) multiplied by the likelihood \(P(E|H)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the personality sketch E of Adam, we can make some educated guesses about the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\) for each field. We assume that \(P(E)\) remains constant across fields for simplification purposes, focusing on comparing relative likelihoods.

**Assumptions for Likelihoods:**
1. **Computer Science:** While high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts are favorable, Adam's strong empathy and love for animals might not be the primary indicators for this field.
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication align well with this field.
3. **Business Administration:** Though high intelligence could be favorable, a love for animals and a warm, empathetic heart might be less indicative of an interest in business administration.

**Assumptions for Prior Probabilities:**
Let's use broad assumptions about the popularity of these fields among graduate students, but keep in mind this is an oversimplification.

1. **Computer Science (29.9% of grad students)**
2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (2.5% of grad students)**
3. **Business Administration (22.6% of grad students)**

Given these assumptions, let's assign some example likelihoods and compute posterior probabilities. Note that absolute values can be recalibrated for precision; only ratios matter for comparisons here.

1. **P(E|Computer Science):** Low to medium likelihood, estimate example: 0.2
2. **P(E|Agricultural and Veterinary Science):** High likelihood, estimate example: 0.8
3. **P(E|Business Administration):** Low to medium likelihood, estimate example: 0.1

**Prior Probabilities \((P(H))**:

1. **P(H_computer_science) = 0.299**
2. **P(H_agricultural_and_veterinary_science) = 0.025**
3. **P(H_business_administration) = 0.226**

Let's calculate the posterior probabilities. Since \(P(E)\) is a normalizing factor common for all, we focus on proportional comparisons:

1. **Computer Science:**
\[ P(H|E_{cs}) \propto P(E|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) = 0.2 \times 0.299 = 0.0598 \]

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
\[ P(H|E_{agri}) \propto P(E|H_{agri}) \cdot P(H_{agri}) = 0.8 \times 0.025 = 0.02 \]

3. **Business Administration:**
\[ P(H|E_{bus}) \propto P(E|H_{bus}) \cdot P(H_{bus}) = 0.1 \times 0.226 = 0.0226 \]

Normalize these to sum to 1 for simplicity of comparison:

Total = \(0.0598 + 0.02 + 0.0226 = 0.1024 \)

Normalized Posterior Probabilities:

\[ P(H|E_{cs}) = \frac{0.0598}{0.1024} \approx 0.584 \]
\[ P(H|E_{agri}) = \frac{0.02}{0.1024} \approx 0.195 \]
\[ P(H|E_{bus}) = \frac{0.0226}{0.1024} \approx 0.221 \]

Since exact decimal precision isn't critical, the values can be presented in the requested format:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.584,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.195,
  "business administration": 0.221
}
```

These values suggest that while computer science has a relatively strong prior, Adam's strong alignment with nature and animals shifts the posterior probability more towards agricultural and veterinary science.
