To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule for each field, we need to consider three components:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**: The probability of Adam being enrolled in each field of study before considering his personality traits.
2. **Likelihood \(P(E|H)\)**: The probability of observing the personality traits given Adam is in each field.
3. **Evidence \(P(E)\)**: The overall likelihood of observing Adam's personality traits across all possible fields.

Bayes' rule is stated as:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

While we lack specific statistical data for these priors and likelihoods, we can make some reasoned estimates based on Adam's traits and how they might align with each field. Let's break it down:

1. **Computer Science**:
   - *Prior (\(P(H)\))*: Computer science is a common graduate field, so a moderate prior probability.
   - *Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))*: Although he enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence, his strong empathy and love for animals seem less aligned with typical computer science traits.
  
2. **Business Administration**:
   - *Prior (\(P(H)\))*: Business administration is also a very common graduate field, so a moderate prior.
   - *Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))*: His empathy might align somewhat with business fields focused on management or CSR, but his deep love for nature and animals seems less relevant.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - *Prior (\(P(H)\))*: Less common field compared to the above two.
   - *Likelihood (\(P(E|H)\))*: Given his love for nature, plants, and animals, and perhaps an affinity for hard work and dedication, this field seems highly consistent with his traits.

Given these reasoned estimates, we can approximate the conditional probabilities, keeping in mind these are rough estimates:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}

These values reflect the qualitative alignment of Adam's traits with each field and the relative rarity or commonness of each field as a graduate study option.
