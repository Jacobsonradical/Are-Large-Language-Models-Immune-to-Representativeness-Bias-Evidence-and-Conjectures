To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to understand Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing evidence \( E \).

Given the limited information provided, we will make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods and priors based on Adam's personality sketch. Since the problem doesn't provide explicit probabilities, we'll look qualitatively at how well each field aligns with the description of Adam:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work, this field seems to align well with his interests.
2. **Business Administration**: This field does not directly correlate with Adam's interests in nature and animals, though his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts are applicable in any field.
3. **Computer Science**: This field aligns with his enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence, but it doesn't directly relate to his love for nature and animals.

With these qualitative assessments in mind, letâ€™s denote our estimates:

\[ P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \] : High
\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \] : Assume moderate prior due to moderate enrollment rates in this field.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \] : Low
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}}) \] : Assume moderate prior due to high enrollment rates in this field.
\[ P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \] : Moderate
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}}) \] : Assume moderate prior due to high enrollment rates in this field.

Without exact values, we can estimate comparatively:

\[ P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}} | E) \approx 0.6 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{business administration}} | E) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(H_{\text{computer science}} | E) \approx 0.3 \]

Therefore, the estimated posterior probabilities can be represented as:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.3
}
```
