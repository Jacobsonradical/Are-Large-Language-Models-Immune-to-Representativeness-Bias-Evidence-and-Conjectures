To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need some base rate probabilities for each field \( P(H) \), the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis \( P(E|H) \), and the total probability of observing the evidence \( P(E) \).

Bayes' rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we must estimate without actual empirical data, we can make reasonable assumptions based on the personality sketch of Adam and typical characteristics of graduate students in these fields.

We'll make these assumptions for our estimates:

1. **Base Rate Probabilities \( P(H) \) for Graduate Fields**:
   - Computer Science: 0.25
   - Business Administration: 0.25
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: 0.15

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   Based on Adam's personality traits, we can rate how well these traits align with each field:
   - Computer Science: Moderate curiosity in nature, good at solving puzzles, high intelligence (let's say 0.4)
   - Business Administration: Empathy and understanding of hard work, but less direct alignment with nature and animals (let's say 0.2)
   - Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Direct alignment with love for nature, plants, animals, and empathy (letâ€™s say 0.8)

3. **Total Probability of Evidence \( P(E) \)**:
   We normalize this value to ensure comparability across hypotheses. 

Using hypothetical numbers for simplicity:

\[
P(E) \approx \sum_{H} P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = (0.4 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.15) = 0.1 + 0.05 + 0.12 = 0.27
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' rule for each field:

- **Computer Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.27} \approx 0.37
  \]

- **Business Administration**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{BA}) \cdot P(H_{BA})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.27} \approx 0.18
  \]

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
  \[
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{AV}) \cdot P(H_{AV})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.27} \approx 0.44
  \]

Based on these numbers:

\[
{
  "computer science": 0.37,
  "business administration": 0.18,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.44
}
\]
