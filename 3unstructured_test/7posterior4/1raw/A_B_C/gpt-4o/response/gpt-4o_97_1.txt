To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the normalizing constant \(P(E)\). 

Here's a simplified approach to estimate these probabilities for the given fields, based on the personality sketch of Adam and the general characteristics of the graduate fields:

1. **Business Administration:**
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Business Administration is a popular field, so the prior might be relatively high.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: Since Adam is described as having a strong love for nature, animals, and abstract concepts, these traits might be less aligned with typical interests in Business Administration.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: Computer Science is also a popular and growing field, suggesting a high prior.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: The description mentions high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, which align well with common traits in Computer Science students, but does not emphasize direct interest or involvement in computing.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Prior Probability, \(P(H)\)**: This field is less popular than the other two, suggesting a lower prior.
   - **Likelihood, \(P(E|H)\)**: The subject's love for nature, plants, animals, empathy, and strong appreciation for dedication aligns very well with this field.

Given this qualitative analysis, let's make some rough estimates for the posterior probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.05",
  "computer science": "0.30",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65"
}
```

These values reflect the following assumptions:
- Business Administration is less likely because the traits don't strongly align with typical interests in the field.
- Computer Science is fairly likely due to the abstract thinking and high intelligence but not definitively strong due to the lack of emphasis on computing interests.
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science is the most likely due to the direct alignment with interest in nature, plants, animals, and empathy.
