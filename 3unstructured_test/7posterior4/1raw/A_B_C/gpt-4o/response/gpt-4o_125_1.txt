To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field given Adam's personality sketch \( E \), we need to use Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given that we do not have specific prior probabilities \( P(H) \) or the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), we'll make reasoned estimates based on the provided personality traits and the general characteristics and requirements of each field. 

### Estimations:
1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and a deep love for animals. This fits very well with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Hence, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively high.

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts, which align with skills needed in computer science.
   - Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - While Adam's intelligence and appreciation for hard work could fit business administration, the specific traits of curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy are less indicative of this field.
   - Accordingly, \( P(E|H) \) is lower.

Given the qualitative assessment, we provide the following approximate probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "computer science": 0.3,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

These values reflect a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science given the personality sketch, a decent probability for computer science due to puzzle-solving and abstract thinking skills, and a lower probability for business administration.
