To compute the posterior conditional probability \(P(H|E)\) for each field using Bayes' rule, we will need the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and evidence \(P(E)\). However, as no prior probabilities and likelihoods are provided, a conceptual approach based on the given information can help us estimate these probabilities. This approach relies on aligning Adam's personality traits with typical characteristics of students in each field.

Given:
- Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and various plants.
- He enjoys solving puzzles.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He possesses high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts.
- He values hard work and dedication.
- He was a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021.

### Fields and Personality Alignment:

1. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is relatively low because the nature-oriented interests, empathy, and love for animals do not strongly align with typical traits emphasized in business administration, although solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts might be beneficial.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is relatively high because a strong curiosity about nature and plants, empathy, and love for animals align well with this field.

3. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \(P(E|H)\) is moderate. Enjoying solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts suit computer science well. However, the strong affinity for nature and animals isn't a typical hallmark of this field, which makes this less probable.

Here's an estimate based on the above logical reasoning:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.2
}
```

These values do not necessarily sum to 1 since there are other graduate fields that Adam could potentially be enrolled in, and probabilities were estimated based on conceptual alignment with the given personality traits.
