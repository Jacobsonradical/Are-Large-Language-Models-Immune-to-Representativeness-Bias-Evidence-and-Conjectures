To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we first need to identify Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_i|E) = \frac{P(E|H_i) \cdot P(H_i)}{P(E)} \]

Here:
- \( P(H_i|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H_i \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H_i) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H_i \).
- \( P(H_i) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H_i \).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence \( E \), which can be computed by summing the products of the likelihood and prior across all considered hypotheses.

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we will have to make qualitative estimations based on the information provided.

### 1. Agricultural and Veterinary Science
Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with this field.

### 2. Business Administration
Adam's personality sketch does not strongly align with traits typically associated with business administration, such as an interest in commerce, management, or finance.

### 3. Computer Science
Adam's interest in solving puzzles and high intelligence, as well as understanding abstract concepts, align well with computer science. However, there is no explicitly stated interest in technology or computers.

Given these qualitative assessments, let's denote probabilities (note these are estimated for demonstration purposes since we don't have exact values):

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) = High (0.8)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) = Low (0.1)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) = Moderate (0.5)

Assuming equal priors for simplicity \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{1}{3} \):

For the relative probabilities (the denominator \( P(E) \) is normalized to ensure the probability sums to 1 across all considered hypotheses):

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \) ∝ \( 0.8 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.267 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \) ∝ \( 0.1 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.033 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \) ∝ \( 0.5 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.167 \)

To find the normalized posterior probabilities:

The normalizing constant \( K = 0.267 + 0.033 + 0.167 = 0.467 \).

So:

- \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) = \frac{0.267}{0.467} \approx 0.572 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) = \frac{0.033}{0.467} \approx 0.071 \)
- \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) = \frac{0.167}{0.467} \approx 0.357 \)

The final probabilities would be:
