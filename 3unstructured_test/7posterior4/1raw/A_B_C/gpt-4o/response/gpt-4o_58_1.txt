To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \(P(H|E)\) for Adam being enrolled in each of the specified fields \(H\) given his personality sketch \(E\), we need to apply Bayes' rule.

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H|E)\) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \(H\) given evidence \(E\).
- \(P(E|H)\) is the likelihood of evidence \(E\) given hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \(H\).
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of evidence \(E\), which can be computed as the sum of \(P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\) over all possible hypotheses.

However, since we do not have actual statistical data to compute these probabilities accurately, we can qualitatively assess the probabilities based on Adam's interests and characteristics described in the personality sketch.

Given Adam's personality traits:
1. Genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
2. Enjoying puzzles.
3. Warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals.
4. High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts.
5. Strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

We can make the following qualitative assessments:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adamâ€™s curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart, it seems highly likely that he'd pursue a field involving plants and animals.
  
- **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with a good understanding of abstract concepts. This aligns well with the skills needed in computer science.
  
- **Business Administration**: Adam's traits don't specifically align with typical characteristics associated with business administration, such as a focus on management, economics, or commerce.

Based on these qualitative assessments:
- \(P(E|H_{agricultural \ and \ veterinary \ science})\) is high.
- \(P(E|H_{computer \ science})\) is moderately high.
- \(P(E|H_{business \ administration})\) is lower.

Using these qualitative assessments to inform the arithmetic:
```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.3
}
```

These values indicate the relative likelihoods based on Adam's personality traits, assuming no prior probabilities are given and normalized to reflect qualitative confidence.
