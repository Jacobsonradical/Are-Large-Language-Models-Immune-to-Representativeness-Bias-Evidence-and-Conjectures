To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) for each field, we can use Bayes' rule, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, in the absence of specific numerical values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) for each field, a qualitative approach will be used to estimate these probabilities. Here's a reasoning approach to approximate these values:

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals. This field aligns well with his personality sketch. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is likely high.

2. **Business Administration**: There is nothing in the personality sketch to suggest an interest in business, administration, or related fields. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is likely very low.

3. **Computer Science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence with the ability to understand abstract concepts. This field could align with his intellectual profile, although it doesn't directly relate to his love for nature and animals. Therefore, \( P(E|H) \) is moderately high.

Now let's qualitatively estimate these probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "computer science": 0.25
}
```
These estimates reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's love for nature and animals, a moderate probability for computer science due to his problem-solving skills and intelligence, and a low probability for business administration due to lack of relevant interests or traits.
