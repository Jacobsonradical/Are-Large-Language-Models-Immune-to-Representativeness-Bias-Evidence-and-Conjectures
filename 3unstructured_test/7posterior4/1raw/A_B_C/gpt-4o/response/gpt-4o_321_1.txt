To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to first understand the elements involved in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

In this particular problem, we're dealing with qualitative assessments and we won't have exact numeric probabilities. However, we can provide relative probabilities based on the information given.

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam is described as having high intelligence and being good at understanding abstract concepts, qualities often associated with individuals in computer science. Additionally, puzzle-solving skills are common in computer science students.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Computer science is a popular field for high-intelligence students.
    - Posterior \( P(H|E) \): Moderate to high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Given Adam's love for nature, plants, and animals, his attributes fit well with this field.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Less popular than computer science but still significant.
    - Posterior \( P(H|E) \): High.

3. **Business Administration**:
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam's strong empathy, appreciation for hard work, and dedication could be beneficial in business administration. However, it is less directly related to his love for nature and animals compared to the other fields.
    - Prior \( P(H) \): Very popular field among graduate students.
    - Posterior \( P(H|E) \): Low to moderate.

Considering these assessments, we estimate the relative posterior probabilities qualitatively as follows:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.6,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8,
  "business administration": 0.4
}
```

These values are based on the fit of Adam's personality sketch to each field's typical attributes and the general popularity of each field among graduate students.
