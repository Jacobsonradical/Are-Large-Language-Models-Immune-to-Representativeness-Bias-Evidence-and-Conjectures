To apply Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities of Adam enrolling in each field and the likelihood of Adam's personality sketch (E) given enrollment in each field. Without specific priors and likelihoods, we'll make some educated assumptions based on the information provided.

Let's assume the following reasonable likelihoods of Adam's personality sketch given each field of study:

1. Computer Science (CS):
  - Given Adam's high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts, the likelihood seems significant.
  - However, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature might not be as strongly aligned with this field.
  - Therefore, let's assume a moderate likelihood for this: P(E|CS) ≈ 0.4

2. Business Administration (BA):
  - Adam's empathy and understanding and appreciation for hard work align well with BA.
  - However, his interest in nature, plants, and animals doesn't align as closely, so let's assume a lower likelihood for this: P(E|BA) ≈ 0.3

3. Agricultural and Veterinary Science (AVS):
  - Given Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy, this field seems the most aligned.
  - Therefore, we'll assume a high likelihood: P(E|AVS) ≈ 0.8

Let P(CS), P(BA), and P(AVS) be the prior probabilities, which we'll assume are equal for simplicity: P(CS) = P(BA) = P(AVS) = 1/3.

Using Bayes' rule: \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \)

\( P(E) \) can be computed as a normalization factor: 
\( P(E) = P(E|CS) * P(CS) + P(E|BA) * P(BA) + P(E|AVS) * P(AVS) \)
\( P(E) = 0.4 * \frac{1}{3} + 0.3 * \frac{1}{3} + 0.8 * \frac{1}{3} \)
\( P(E) = \frac{0.4 + 0.3 + 0.8}{3} = \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5 \)

Now, compute the posterior probabilities:

- For Computer Science:
  \( P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) * P(CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 * \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{1.5} = \frac{4}{15} ≈ 0.267 \)

- For Business Administration:
  \( P(BA|E) = \frac{P(E|BA) * P(BA)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.3 * \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.3}{1.5} = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2 \)

- For Agricultural and Veterinary Science:
  \( P(AVS|E) = \frac{P(E|AVS) * P(AVS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 * \frac{1}{3}}{0.5} = \frac{0.8}{1.5} = \frac{8}{15} ≈ 0.533 \)

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.267,
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.533
}
```
