To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the following components for each field hypothesis \( H \):

1. **The prior probability** \( P(H) \): The initial probability of Adam being enrolled in a particular field.
2. **The likelihood** \( P(E|H) \): The probability of observing the personality sketch \( E \) given that Adam is enrolled in the field \( H \).

Bayes' rule states \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor which ensures that the probabilities sum up to 1 over all possible hypotheses \( H \). In practice, calculating \( P(E) \) exactly can be extremely complicated. Therefore, we focus on the relative values of \( P(H|E) \).

Given that, let's make educated estimations for the purposes of this exercise:

1. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**:
   - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: The personality traits such as genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy are highly consistent with this field. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is quite high.
   - For **computer science**: The traits like high intelligence and solving puzzles are favorable for this field, but not all the traits align perfectly. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is moderate.
   - For **business administration**: The personality traits do not strongly align with this field. A background in hard work and dedication is helpful, but other traits like empathy and love for animals are less relevant. Thus, \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low.

2. **Prior \( P(H) \)**:
   - Assume some rough priors based on general enrollment trends:
     - Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.1
     - Computer science: 0.3
     - Business administration: 0.2

We combine these with the likelihoods to form qualitative posterior values:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "computer science": "0.5",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
```

These values reflect the high alignment of Adam's traits with agricultural and veterinary science, moderate alignment with computer science, and relatively low alignment with business administration. Note that these are not precise calculations but educated estimates reflecting how well each field matches Adam's personality sketch based on qualitative reasoning.
