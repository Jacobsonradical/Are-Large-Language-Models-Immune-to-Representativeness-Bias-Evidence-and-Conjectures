Bayes' rule states that the posterior probability \(P(H|E)\) can be computed using the formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to properly apply Bayes' rule, we need specific values for the prior probabilities \(P(H)\), the likelihoods \(P(E|H)\), and the evidence \(P(E)\). Since those values are not provided, I'll need to make some reasonable assumptions based on general trends and the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- \( H_2 \) as Adam being enrolled in computer science.
- \( H_3 \) as Adam being enrolled in business administration.

Given the personality sketch of Adam (E), let's intuitively estimate the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   - High likelihood given Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_1) \approx 0.8 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   - Moderate likelihood given Adam's high intelligence, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts, though it doesn't particularly align with his love for nature and animals.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_2) \approx 0.5 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   - Low likelihood given the personality traits described. There's no mention of typical traits associated with business administration like leadership or strategic decision-making.
   - Estimated \( P(E|H_3) \approx 0.2 \)

Assume prior probabilities for simplicity (not based on any actual statistical data, just to give an illustration):
- \( P(H_1) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_3) = 0.2 \)

Now, let's compute the posterior probabilities using the simplified version of Bayes' rule \( P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \):

1. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
   \( P(H_1|E) \propto 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)

2. **Computer Science**:
   \( P(H_2|E) \propto 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \)

3. **Business Administration**:
   \( P(H_3|E) \propto 0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04 \)

To give these as relative probabilities without normalizing:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.24,
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "business administration": 0.04
}

These values indicate the relative likelihoods of Adam being enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch. However, note that these values are illustrative and depend heavily on the assumptions made. Actual calculations would require specific prior and likelihood data.
