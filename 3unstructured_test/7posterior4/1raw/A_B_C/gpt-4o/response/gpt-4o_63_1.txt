To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for Adam being enrolled in different fields, we apply Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Given the data, let's break this into steps:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of Adam being enrolled in each field before considering the personality sketch. We might assume that graduate students are uniformly distributed across fields without specific data, but in reality, some fields might be more common. For simplicity, let’s assume uniform distribution:

    - \( P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = \frac{1}{N} \)
    - \( P(H_{\text{computer science}}) = \frac{1}{N} \)
    - \( P(H_{\text{business administration}}) = \frac{1}{N} \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how likely Adam’s personality sketch is if he were in each field.

    - For **agricultural and veterinary science**: Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature, plants, animals, a warm heart, empathy, and appreciation for hard work. This personality fits well, so \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \) should be relatively high.
    - For **computer science**: Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts. This fits moderately well, so \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \) should be moderate.
    - For **business administration**: The traits described (nature curiosity, plants, love for animals, empathy) don't fit particularly well with the traditional expectations of a business student, so \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \) should be relatively low.

3. **Normalization**: To normalize and find the posterior, we need the total probability \( P(E) \), which is the sum across all relevant fields but for simplicity in comparison, we will assume it’s normalized correctly in our chosen context.

Based on this qualitative assessment, let's assign plausible probabilities:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) = 0.1 \)

Now, let's present the posterior probabilities, keeping in mind they are not normalized to sum to 1 because not all possible fields are included:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "computer science": 0.5,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Note: These values are estimated and should be verified with more precise data regarding the actual prevalence of these fields and more precise likelihood assessments.
