To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Bayes' Rule**: 
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Here, \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being enrolled in a given field, \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the personality sketch given enrollment in the field, and \( P(E) \) is the normalization factor ensuring all probabilities sum to 1.

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This represents how common each field is among all graduate students in the U.S. Assuming we have no specific numbers, we will consider an equal prior for now for simplicity.

3. **Likelihood \( P(E|H) \)**: This represents how well the given personality sketch matches typical profiles in each field. We'll assess this qualitatively based on the description.

Given the personality sketch:
- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: High match due to curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals.
- **Business Administration**: Lower match; the personality sketch doesn't strongly emphasize traits typically associated with business administration.
- **Computer Science**: Moderate match due to high intelligence and aptitude for solving puzzles, but less emphasis compared to animals and nature.

Without concrete statistical data for prior probabilities and relying on qualitative assessment, we'll make an educated guess. Let's use the following qualitative assessments:

- \( P(E|H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}) \approx 0.7 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{business administration}}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E|H_{\text{computer science}}) \approx 0.2 \)

Assuming equal priors \( P(H) \) for simplicity (without specific data, this assumption might be 1/3 for each field), we compute the normalized probabilities:

\[
P(H|E) \propto P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H_{\text{agricultural and veterinary science}}|E) \approx 0.7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.233
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{business administration}}|E) \approx 0.1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.033
\]
\[
P(H_{\text{computer science}}|E) \approx 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 0.067
\]

Since our normalization factor \( P(E) \) would simply ensure these values sum up proportionately, we can use these raw scores directly for qualitative comparison:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.233,
  "business administration": 0.033,
  "computer science": 0.067
}
```

These percentages do not sum to 1, but they indicate the relative likelihoods given the personality sketch.
