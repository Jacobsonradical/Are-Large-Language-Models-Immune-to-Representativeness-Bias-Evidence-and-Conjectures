To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to consider Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of observing evidence \( E \).

Let's logically dissect each field and estimate the probabilities qualitatively based on Adam's personality sketch.

### Agricultural and Veterinary Science
- Given Adam's curiosity about nature, plants, and love for animals, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for agricultural and veterinary science is very high.
- The prior \( P(H) \) for being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science might be moderate, considering the variety of fields graduate students can choose from.

### Business Administration
- Adam's profile does not strongly align with business administration. While he shows qualities like high intelligence and understanding of dedication, these are relatively less indicative of a specific interest in business compared to other fields.
- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \) for business administration is probably low.

### Computer Science
- Adam enjoys solving puzzles and has a knack for abstract concepts, which aligns well with computer science.
- However, his deep love for nature and animals is less directly relevant to computer science compared to fields like agricultural and veterinary science.

Using these qualitative assessment, letâ€™s set some comparative numbers:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4
}

These values reflect the high likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science due to Adam's nature-related interests, a low likelihood for business administration because of a mismatch in stated interests, and a moderate likelihood for computer science due to his abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.
