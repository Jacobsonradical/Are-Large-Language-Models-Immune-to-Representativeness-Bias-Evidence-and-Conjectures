To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \), we need to apply Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Here's a breakdown of the components:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability we want to calculate.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the evidence, which is the total probability of observing \( E \) under all hypotheses.

Given that the priors \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \) are unknown and not provided explicitly, I'll estimate these values based on the description of Adam and typical distributions within the fields:

- **Computer Science:**
  - Adam's strong intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts increase \( P(E|H_{\text{CS}}) \).
  - Quietness and puzzle-solving behavior are common in computer science fields.
  - However, genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals might reduce this likelihood somewhat.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
  - Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work significantly increase \( P(E|H_{\text{Ag/Vet}}) \).
  - Strong empathy and warm heart align well with this field.

- **Business Administration:**
  - Abstract thinking and high intelligence are somewhat needed, increasing \( P(E|H_{\text{BA}}) \).
  - However, other aspects like empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature don't align as strongly with Business Administration.

Based on these qualitative assessments, here are the approximate probabilities (values are illustrative and not calculated from empirical data):

{
  "computer science": 0.25,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6,
  "business administration": 0.15
