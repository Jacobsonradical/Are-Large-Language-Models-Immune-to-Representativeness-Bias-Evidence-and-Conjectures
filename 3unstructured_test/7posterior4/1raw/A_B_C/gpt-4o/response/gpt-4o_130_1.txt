To compute the posterior conditional probabilities \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given enrollment in each field. Since the exact prior probabilities and likelihoods are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical distributions and the provided personality sketch.

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Let's assume the following prior probabilities based on common enrollment distributions in U.S. graduate programs:
- \( P(\text{computer science}) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{business administration}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.05 \)

Given Adam's personality sketch, the likelihoods may be assumed as follows:
- \( P(E|\text{computer science}) \): Since Adam loves puzzles and has high intelligence, but there is no explicit mention of a strong interest in technology or computing, this might be moderate. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{computer science}) = 0.4 \).
- \( P(E|\text{business administration}) \): Adam's personality of warmth, empathy, and a love for abstract concepts does not strongly align with business administration. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{business administration}) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \): Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly suggests this field. Let's assume \( P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) = 0.8 \).

\( P(E) \) is the normalization constant, calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science}) + P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration}) + P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.4 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.20) + (0.8 \cdot 0.05) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 + 0.02 + 0.04 = 0.16 \]

Now we calculate each posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{computer science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{computer science}) \cdot P(\text{computer science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.25}{0.16} = \frac{0.1}{0.16} = 0.625 \]

\[ P(\text{business administration}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{business administration}) \cdot P(\text{business administration})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.20}{0.16} = \frac{0.02}{0.16} = 0.125 \]

\[ P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{agricultural and veterinary science}) \cdot P(\text{agricultural and veterinary science})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.05}{0.16} = \frac{0.04}{0.16} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior conditional probabilities are:
```json
{
  "computer science": 0.625,
  "business administration": 0.125,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.25
}
```
