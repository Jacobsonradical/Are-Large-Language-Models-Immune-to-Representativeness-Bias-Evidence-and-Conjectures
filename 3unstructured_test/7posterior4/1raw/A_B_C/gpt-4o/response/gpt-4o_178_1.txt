To compute the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), we would normally apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, without specific values for the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \), it's challenging to produce precise numerical values. Instead, we can produce a qualitative assessment based on the provided details of Adam's personality sketch.

Given Adam's traits:
- A genuine curiosity about nature and plants
- A love for animals
- Warm heart, strong empathy
- High intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts

These traits influence the likelihood of him being enrolled in specific fields.

1. **Computer Science**: A strong understanding of abstract concepts and high intelligence are relevant traits. However, there is less emphasis on nature, animals, and empathy in this field compared to the others.
   
2. **Business Administration**: While empathy is important in business leadership, the strong focus on nature, plants, and animals is less relevant.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field directly involves nature, plants, and animals. A high level of empathy, curiosity about nature, and a warm heart are extraordinarily fitting traits for this field.

Based on this qualitative analysis, our rational judgment on the probabilities would be:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.1,
  "business administration": 0.05,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.85
}
```

These numbers are provided to illustrate the relative likelihoods based on the personality sketch described. The actual probabilities can only be exact if we have specific numeric priors and likelihoods.
