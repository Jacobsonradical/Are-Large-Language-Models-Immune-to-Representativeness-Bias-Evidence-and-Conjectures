To calculate the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need the prior probability \( P(H) \) for each field and the likelihood \( P(E|H) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Without specific data for \( P(H) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we can make educated guesses based on the given personality sketch.

Here's the educated guess for each field's prior probability, considering typical graduate enrollments in the U.S.:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \):
  - Computer science: 0.25
  - Business administration: 0.2
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.15
  
We also estimate the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) based on how well Adam’s personality sketch fits each field:

- Likelihood \( P(E|H) \):
  - Computer science: 0.2 (high intelligence and good at solving puzzles suggest a fit, but not a perfect correlation with nature and animals)
  - Business administration: 0.05 (less likely given the personality traits focused more on empathy and love for animals)
  - Agricultural and veterinary science: 0.5 (strong love for nature and animals suggests a high likelihood)

Let’s assume \( P(E) \) is the sum of these products for normalization purposes:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}}) + P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}}) + P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}}) \]

\( P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.05 \times 0.2) + (0.5 \times 0.15) \)
\( P(E) = 0.05 + 0.01 + 0.075 \)
\( P(E) = 0.135 \)

Now, we compute the posterior probabilities:

- \( P(H_{\text{cs}}|E) \):
  \[ = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{cs}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{cs}})}{P(E)} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.135} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.05}{0.135} \approx 0.370 \]

- \( P(H_{\text{ba}}|E) \):
  \[ = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{ba}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{ba}})}{P(E)} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.05 \times 0.2}{0.135} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.01}{0.135} \approx 0.074 \]

- \( P(H_{\text{agri}}|E) \):
  \[ = \frac{P(E|H_{\text{agri}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{agri}})}{P(E)} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.5 \times 0.15}{0.135} \]
  \[ = \frac{0.075}{0.135} \approx 0.556 \]

Thus, the probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": "0.370",
  "business administration": "0.074",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.556"
}
