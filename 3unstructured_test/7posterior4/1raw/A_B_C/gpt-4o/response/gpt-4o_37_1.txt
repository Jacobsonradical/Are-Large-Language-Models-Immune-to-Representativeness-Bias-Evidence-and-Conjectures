To compute the posterior probability P(H|E) for each field using Bayes' rule, we need to consider:

1. The prior probability of Adam being enrolled in each field. This is P(H).
2. The likelihood of observing the personality traits E given that Adam is enrolled in each field. This is P(E|H).

Bayes' rule is given by:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Since we don't have specific numerical values for the priors (P(H)) or the exact likelihoods (P(E|H)), we'll qualitatively reason through each.

1. **Business administration**:
   - **Prior probability (P(H))**: Moderate. Many students enroll in business-related fields, but there's no specific indication from Adam's personality sketch that he has a strong inclination toward business.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Low. Adam's strong love for nature, animals, and puzzles doesn't align closely with typical traits found in business administration students.

2. **Agricultural and veterinary science**:
   - **Prior probability (P(H))**: Lower compared to some other fields but definitively relevant.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: High. Adamâ€™s love for nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work are strong indicators for this field.

3. **Computer science**:
   - **Prior probability (P(H))**: High. Computer science is a popular field and fits well with Adam's intelligence and interest in solving puzzles.
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H))**: Moderate to high. While his interest in puzzles and intelligence align well, his strong empathy and love for nature and animals are not primary indicators for this field.

Given this qualitative reasoning, we can assign approximate values for these probabilities.
