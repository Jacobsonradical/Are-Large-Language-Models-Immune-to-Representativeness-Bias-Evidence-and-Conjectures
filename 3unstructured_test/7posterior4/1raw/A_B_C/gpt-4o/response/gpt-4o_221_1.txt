To compute the posterior conditional probabilities using Bayes' rule, we need the base rates (priors) for each field of study, the likelihood of observing Adam’s personality sketch given each field of study, and the total probability of observing the sketch across all fields of study. Since actual base rates and other specific data are unavailable, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the description provided.

Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of H given E.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of E given H.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of H.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of E.

Since P(E) is constant across all fields of study, we primarily consider the product of \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(H) \).

We can make the following assumptions:

1. **Computer Science**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Let’s assume it’s reasonably high, say 0.3, as computer science is a common field.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s profile doesn’t strongly fit the stereotypical CS student, but his intelligence and abstract thinking are relevant. Let's assign 0.1.

2. **Business Administration**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Moderate likelihood, say 0.2.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Adam’s profile doesn’t strongly align with typical business administration students. Low likelihood, let's assign 0.05.

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**:
    - Prior probability \( P(H) \): Less common than CS, let’s say 0.1.
    - Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): Strong fit given Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy. High likelihood, let's assign 0.5.

Now, combining these factors:
- Computer Science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.1 \times 0.3 = 0.03 \)
- Business Administration: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.05 \times 0.2 = 0.01 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( P(H|E) \propto 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05 \)

We push forward to a consistent value assignment (normalizing them):
- Total: 0.03 + 0.01 + 0.05 = 0.09

So:
- Computer Science: \( \frac{0.03}{0.09} \approx 0.333 \)
- Business Administration: \( \frac{0.01}{0.09} \approx 0.111 \)
- Agricultural and Veterinary Science: \( \frac{0.05}{0.09} \approx 0.556 \)

Thus, the approximate posterior probabilities are:

{
  "computer science": 0.333,
  "business administration": 0.111,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.556
