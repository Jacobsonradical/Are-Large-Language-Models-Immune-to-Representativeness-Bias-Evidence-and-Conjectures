To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) for each hypothesis \( H \) (the field of study) given the evidence \( E \) (the personality sketch), we can use Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

However, to provide specific numeric values, we would typically require data on the base rates \( P(H) \) and the likelihoods \( P(E|H) \). Since such data is not provided here, I'll provide a qualitative estimation based on the given personality sketch.

1. **Business Administration:**
   - Likelihood \( \left( P(E|H_{BA}) \right) \): Based on Adam's personality, business administration doesn't seem to strongly align. While intelligence and understanding abstract concepts can be beneficial in business administration, the strong empathy, love for animals, and interest in nature do not strongly align with typical attributes for this field.
   - Prior \( \left( P(H_{BA}) \right) \): Let's assume the prior probability for business administration among graduate students is moderate since it is a popular field but not super dominant.
   - Posterior Probability \( \left( P(H_{BA}|E) \right) \): Low

2. **Computer Science:**
   - Likelihood \( \left( P(E|H_{CS}) \right) \): Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts align well with computer science. His enjoyment of solving puzzles also fits. However, his strong empathy and love for animals are less directly relevant.
   - Prior \( \left( P(H_{CS}) \right) \): Let's assume the prior for computer science is relatively high given the field's popularity among graduate students.
   - Posterior Probability \( \left( P(H_{CS}|E) \right) \): Medium to High

3. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - Likelihood \( \left( P(E|H_{AVS}) \right) \): This field strongly aligns with Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and warm heart. These are highly relevant to agricultural and veterinary science.
   - Prior \( \left( P(H_{AVS}) \right) \): Let's assume the prior for agricultural and veterinary science is moderate to low, considering it is not as commonly chosen as business administration or computer science.
   - Posterior Probability \( \left( P(H_{AVS}|E) \right) \): High

Given the qualitative assessment, the posterior probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

These are estimated values and would need actual data on base rates and likelihoods for precise computation.
