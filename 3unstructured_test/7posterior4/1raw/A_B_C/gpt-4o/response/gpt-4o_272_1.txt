To compute the posterior conditional probability \( P(H|E) \) using Bayes' rule, we need to know the prior probabilities \( P(H) \) for each field, the likelihood \( P(E|H) \) of observing Adam's personality sketch given that he is in a specific field, and the evidence \( P(E) \). 

However, as we lack exact numerical priors and likelihoods for these fields, we'll need to make qualitative assessments based on the sketch provided. We can then make educated guesses to estimate the posterior probability. Let’s consider the given information and think about how likely Adam’s characteristics match each field:

1. **Computer Science:**
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam's high intelligence and good understanding of abstract concepts align well with computer science. Although empathy and love for animals are not directly related, his interest in solving puzzles suggests a natural fit.
   - **Prior (P(H)):** High, as computer science is a common field of study.
   - **Overall fit:** Moderate to high.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:**
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, dedication, strong empathy, and love for animals strongly suggest a match with agricultural and veterinary science.
   - **Prior (P(H)):** Moderate, as this is a specialized field but not uncommon.
   - **Overall fit:** High.

3. **Business Administration:**
   - **Likelihood (P(E|H)):** Adam's characteristics of empathy and dedication could be useful in business, but his love for nature, animals, and abstract problem-solving is less relevant.
   - **Prior (P(H)):** High, as business administration is a widely chosen field.
   - **Overall fit:** Low to moderate.

Given these qualitative assessments, here's an estimate of the posterior conditional probabilities:

```json
{
  "computer science": 0.4,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

Note: These values are not based on actual data but rather on an informed qualitative assessment of the likelihoods and priors.
