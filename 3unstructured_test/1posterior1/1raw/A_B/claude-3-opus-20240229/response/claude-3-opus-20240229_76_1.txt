Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam has a strong interest in and empathy for animals, as well as a curiosity about nature and plants. This suggests a high probability that he was studying something related to agricultural and veterinary science.

The sketch mentions his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, which could lend itself to business administration. However, there is no direct indication of interest in business, management, finance, or related fields. So I assign a lower probability to business administration.

Of course, there are many other fields he could have been pursuing as well, given his academic strengths. But based solely on the details provided, agricultural and veterinary science seems the most likely area of focus in graduate school.
