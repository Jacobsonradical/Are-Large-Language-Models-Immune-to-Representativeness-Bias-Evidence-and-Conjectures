Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a higher probability that he was enrolled in a graduate program in agricultural and veterinary science.

While it's possible he could have pursued business administration, as he has an appreciation for hard work and dedication, the other details in his personality sketch seem to align more closely with a field involving nature and animals. Therefore, I assigned a lower (but non-zero) probability to business administration.
