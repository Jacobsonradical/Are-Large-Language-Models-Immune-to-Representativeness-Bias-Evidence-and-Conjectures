Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have strong interests and aptitude aligned with agricultural and veterinary science, including his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, high intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. These qualities suggest a relatively high probability, around 65%, that he may have pursued graduate studies in that field.

In contrast, the description does not provide strong evidence of interest in business administration. While he is intelligent and appreciates hard work, there is no specific indication of passion for business-related topics. As such, I estimate a lower probability of around 10% that he specialized in business administration.
