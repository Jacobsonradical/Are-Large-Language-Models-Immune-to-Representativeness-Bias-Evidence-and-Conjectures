Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract problem solving. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns very well with these traits, so I estimate a relatively high 60% probability he was enrolled in that field.

Business administration does not seem to match his stated interests and strengths as closely, so I assign a lower 10% probability to that field. While it's certainly possible he was studying business, the given description suggests other fields are more likely.
