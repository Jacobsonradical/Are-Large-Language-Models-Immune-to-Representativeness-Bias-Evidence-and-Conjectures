Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a higher likelihood of him pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and stated career interests, there is still some possibility he may have chosen to study business. The probabilities I provided reflect my best estimate given the limited information available in the personality sketch.
