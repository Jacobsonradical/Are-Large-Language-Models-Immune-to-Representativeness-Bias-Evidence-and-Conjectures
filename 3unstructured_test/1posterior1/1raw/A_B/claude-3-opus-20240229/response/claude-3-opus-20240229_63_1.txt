Here is my estimate of the probabilities for Adam's graduate field of study in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, his curiosity about nature and plants, deep love for animals, and high intelligence suggest a much higher likelihood of studying agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, I still assign a small probability to business administration since his strong work ethic and appreciation for dedication could potentially align with that field as well.
