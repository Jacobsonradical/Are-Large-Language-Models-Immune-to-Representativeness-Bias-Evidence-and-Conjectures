Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems much more likely to be studying agricultural and veterinary science given his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. His abstract thinking skills could lend themselves well to scientific research. Business administration seems less probable given his quiet nature and interests, though it's still possible. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have been studying as well.
