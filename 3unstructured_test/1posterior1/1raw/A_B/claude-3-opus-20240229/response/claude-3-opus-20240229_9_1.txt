Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he has a strong interest in and empathy for nature, plants, and animals. He is also highly intelligent and good at abstract thinking. This profile suggests he is much more likely to be enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, there is still a small possibility he could be in business administration given his strong work ethic and dedication. The probabilities I've assigned reflect my estimate that agricultural and veterinary science is the most likely field by far for Adam, but business administration can't be completely ruled out based on the information provided.
