Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and deep love for animals suggest a strong inclination towards agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would also serve him well in this field.

While his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of interest or aptitude in that area specifically. So I assign a lower probability to that field of study for Adam.
