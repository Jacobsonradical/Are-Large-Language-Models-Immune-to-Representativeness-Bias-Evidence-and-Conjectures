Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has a strong interest in and affinity for nature, plants, animals, hard work and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. While he could potentially apply his intelligence and work ethic to business administration, his specific interests seem to point more towards a scientific field related to nature and animals. Of course, there are many other possible fields he could have pursued as well.
