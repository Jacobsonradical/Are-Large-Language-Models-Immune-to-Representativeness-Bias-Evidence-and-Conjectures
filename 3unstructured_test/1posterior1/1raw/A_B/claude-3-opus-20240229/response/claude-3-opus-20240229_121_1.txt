Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for fields related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a higher probability that he was enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about his academic interests and background, there is still significant uncertainty in these estimates.
