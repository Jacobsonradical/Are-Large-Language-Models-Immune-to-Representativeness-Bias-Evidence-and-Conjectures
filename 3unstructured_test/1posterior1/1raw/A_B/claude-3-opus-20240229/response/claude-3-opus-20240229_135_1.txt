Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and aptitude for topics related to nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns well with a specialization in agricultural and veterinary science. While it's possible he pursued business administration, the given information points more strongly toward agricultural and veterinary science as a likely field of graduate study for Adam.
