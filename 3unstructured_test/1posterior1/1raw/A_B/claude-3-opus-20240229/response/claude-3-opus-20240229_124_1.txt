Here is my estimate of the probabilities of Adam being enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.15"
}

The personality description suggests Adam has strong interests and traits that align well with agricultural and veterinary science, such as his curiosity about nature and plants, love for animals, and appreciation of hard work and dedication. These characteristics make it more probable that he would pursue graduate studies in that field.

While he has high intelligence and can understand abstract concepts, which could lend itself to business administration, the sketch does not emphasize traits that would make business a strong draw over other fields. So I estimate a lower probability for that field of study.
