Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems much more likely to be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science given his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration seems less probable given his quiet demeanor and interest in puzzles and abstract concepts, though it's still a possibility. Of course, there are many other potential fields he could have pursued as well.
