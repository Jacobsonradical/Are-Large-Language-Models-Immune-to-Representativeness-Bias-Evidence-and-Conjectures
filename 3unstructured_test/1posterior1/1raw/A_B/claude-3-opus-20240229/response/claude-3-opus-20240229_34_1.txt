Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong interest and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract thinking. This suggests a higher probability that he would pursue graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about his undergraduate background and stated career interests, there is still some possibility he may have opted for an MBA or business-related field.
