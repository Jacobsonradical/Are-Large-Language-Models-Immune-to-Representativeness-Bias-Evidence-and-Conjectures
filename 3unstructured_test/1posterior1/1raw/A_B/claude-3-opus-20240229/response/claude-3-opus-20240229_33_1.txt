Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch which highlights his curiosity about nature, plants, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, he seems much more likely to have been pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. His quiet nature, empathy, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts also seem well-suited for a scientific field of study. Business administration is certainly possible but the given description points more strongly to agricultural and veterinary science in my assessment.
