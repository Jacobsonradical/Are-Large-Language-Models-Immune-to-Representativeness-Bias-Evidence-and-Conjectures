Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the specified graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a high probability (around 60%) that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

His aptitude for understanding abstract concepts and high intelligence could lend themselves to various fields, including business administration. However, given his specific interests and personality traits, I estimate a lower probability (around 15%) for enrollment in a business administration program compared to agricultural and veterinary science.
