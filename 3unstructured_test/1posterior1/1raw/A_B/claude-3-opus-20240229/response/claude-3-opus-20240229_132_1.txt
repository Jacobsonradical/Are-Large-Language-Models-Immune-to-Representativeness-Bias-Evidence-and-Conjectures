Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of pursuing agricultural and veterinary science compared to business administration. However, their high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts leave open the possibility of specializing in business. The personality sketch provides more evidence pointing towards agricultural and veterinary science overall.
