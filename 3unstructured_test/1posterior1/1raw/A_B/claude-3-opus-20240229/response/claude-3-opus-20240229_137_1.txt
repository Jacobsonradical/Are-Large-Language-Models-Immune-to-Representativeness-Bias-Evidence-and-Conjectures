Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.15",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.70"
}

Based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his deep empathy, I believe there is a high probability he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His appreciation for hard work and dedication also align with this field.

While it's possible he was studying business administration, as his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit that field, I think it's less likely than agricultural and veterinary science given his specific interests and personality traits. Still, I didn't want to completely rule it out.
