Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems much more likely to be drawn to agricultural and veterinary science given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication. Business administration is a possibility but seems less likely to match his core interests and traits.
