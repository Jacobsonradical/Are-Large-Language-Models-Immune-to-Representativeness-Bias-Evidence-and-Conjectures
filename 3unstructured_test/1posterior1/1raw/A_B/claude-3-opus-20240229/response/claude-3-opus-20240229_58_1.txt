Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the listed fields in 2021:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for topics related to nature, plants, animals and biology. This suggests a high probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science. His curiosity, intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts would serve him well in this field.

In contrast, the description does not strongly indicate an interest in business administration. While he appreciates hard work and dedication which are important in business, overall the personality sketch points much more towards sciences related to nature and animals rather than a business focus. So I assigned a relatively low probability to business administration.
