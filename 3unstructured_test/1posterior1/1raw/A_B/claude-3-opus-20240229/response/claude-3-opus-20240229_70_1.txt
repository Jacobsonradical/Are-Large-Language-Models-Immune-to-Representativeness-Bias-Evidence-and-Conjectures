Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified graduate fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.65",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, animals, and his empathetic personality, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 65%) that he was pursuing graduate studies related to agricultural and veterinary science.

On the other hand, while his intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could lend themselves to business studies, his personality profile suggests a lower likelihood (around 10%) of him specializing in business administration compared to a more nature and animal-focused field.
