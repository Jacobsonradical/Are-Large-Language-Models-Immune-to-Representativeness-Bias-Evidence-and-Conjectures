Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for agricultural and veterinary science given his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts. Graduate studies in this field would align well with his interests and strengths.

While it's possible Adam pursued business administration, it seems less likely given his personality profile, so I assigned a lower probability of 0.2 for that field. Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields he could have specialized in beyond these two.
