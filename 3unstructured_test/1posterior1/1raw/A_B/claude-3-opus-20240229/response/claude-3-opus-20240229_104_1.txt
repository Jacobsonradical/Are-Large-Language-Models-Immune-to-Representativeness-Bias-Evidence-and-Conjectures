Here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This leads me to estimate a relatively high 60% probability that he was pursuing graduate studies in agricultural and veterinary science.

While he has qualities like intelligence and understanding of hard work that could lend themselves to business administration, his specific interests seem less aligned with that field. So I estimate a lower 20% probability of him being enrolled in a business administration graduate program.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have potentially pursued. But based solely on the given personality sketch, those are my best estimates for the two specified fields.
