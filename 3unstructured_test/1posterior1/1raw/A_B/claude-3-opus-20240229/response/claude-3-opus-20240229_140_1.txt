Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in the given fields as a graduate student in the U.S. in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong interest in and aptitude for subjects related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This suggests a higher probability that he was enrolled in a graduate program in agricultural and veterinary science.

While it's possible he could have been in a business administration program, the sketch doesn't provide strong evidence to support this. His curiosity, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend themselves to business studies, but the specific interests outlined align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
