Here is my estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have a strong interest in and appreciation for nature, animals, and abstract concepts. This aligns more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. His curiosity, intelligence and dedication also seem well-suited for scientific study and research. While it's certainly possible he pursued an MBA, I think it's more likely given his profile that he was enrolled in a graduate program related to agriculture, animals or veterinary medicine.
