Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in and connection with nature, plants, and animals. His curiosity, empathy and love for animals, along with an appreciation for hard work and dedication, seem well-suited to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. 

Business administration is certainly a possibility for someone of high intelligence who is good at understanding abstract concepts. However, the sketch focuses more on Adam's affinity for nature and animals rather than business, so I estimate a lower probability for that field based solely on the information provided.
