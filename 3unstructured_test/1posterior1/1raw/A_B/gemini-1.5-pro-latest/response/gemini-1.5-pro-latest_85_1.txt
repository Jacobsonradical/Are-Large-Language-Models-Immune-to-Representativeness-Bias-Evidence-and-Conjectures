Here's a breakdown of the probabilities based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also serve him well. 

* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence is valuable in business, nothing in the description points to a specific interest in business, finance, or management. His empathetic nature might make him a good leader, but that alone isn't enough to suggest a high probability.

**Important Note:** These probabilities are subjective estimations based on limited information. Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
