Here's an estimated probability based on the personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science:** Adam's love for nature, animals, and understanding of hard work strongly suggests an affinity for this field. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial. 
* **Business Administration:** While Adam's intelligence could lend itself to business, nothing in his personality sketch points to a strong interest in the core aspects of this field (finance, marketing, management). 

**Important Note:** These are just educated guesses based on limited information.  Personality traits alone cannot definitively predict someone's field of study. Many other factors influence career choices.
