Here's my assessment of the probabilities based on Adam's personality sketch:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):**  Adam's love for animals, curiosity about nature, and empathy strongly suggest an affinity for this field. His intelligence and understanding of hard work would also serve him well. 
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While intelligence and problem-solving skills are valuable in business, nothing in Adam's description points specifically towards an interest in business administration.  

**Important Note:** This is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information.  Many other fields could also be a good fit for Adam.
