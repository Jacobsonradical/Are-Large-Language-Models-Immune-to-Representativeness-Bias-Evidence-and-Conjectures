} 

**Reasoning:**

Adam's personality sketch strongly suggests an affinity for fields related to nature, animals, and problem-solving.  

* **Agricultural and Veterinary Science (0.7):** This field aligns perfectly with his love for animals, interest in plants, and appreciation for hard work. A graduate program in this area is a very plausible fit.
* **Business Administration (0.1):** While Adam is intelligent and capable, his personality description lacks strong indicators of interest in business, finance, or management.  It's possible he could be in this field, but less likely given the provided information.
