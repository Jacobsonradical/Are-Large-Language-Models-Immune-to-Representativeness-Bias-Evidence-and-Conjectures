```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.15
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a high likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his appreciation for hard work and dedication could translate to any field, his personality traits and interests do not strongly indicate a focus on business administration. Therefore, the probability for this field is lower but not zero.
