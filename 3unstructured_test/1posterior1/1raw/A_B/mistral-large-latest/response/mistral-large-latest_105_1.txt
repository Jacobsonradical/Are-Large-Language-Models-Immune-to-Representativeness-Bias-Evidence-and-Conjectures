Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could make him suitable for various fields, his quiet nature and interests seem less aligned with business administration. However, there's still a possibility, hence a lower but non-zero probability.
