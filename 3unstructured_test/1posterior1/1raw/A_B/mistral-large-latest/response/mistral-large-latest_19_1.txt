Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to various fields, but his specific interests and qualities align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science.
- Business administration is less likely given his interests and personality traits, but it is not entirely ruled out, hence a lower probability.
