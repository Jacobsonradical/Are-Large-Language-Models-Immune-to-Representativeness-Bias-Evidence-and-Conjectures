Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- His quiet nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, and appreciation for hard work and dedication also align more closely with the rigors of scientific study rather than business administration.
- While he is of high intelligence and good at understanding abstract concepts, which could be useful in business administration, his interests and personality traits seem to lean more towards fields related to nature and animals.
