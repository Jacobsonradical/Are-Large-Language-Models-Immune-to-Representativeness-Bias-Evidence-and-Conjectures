Based on the personality sketch provided, here are the estimated probabilities for Adam's fields of study:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.2,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Explanation:
- Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy suggest a higher likelihood of him being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science.
- While his high intelligence and understanding of abstract concepts could apply to business administration, his interests and personality traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science. Therefore, the probability for business administration is lower but not zero.
