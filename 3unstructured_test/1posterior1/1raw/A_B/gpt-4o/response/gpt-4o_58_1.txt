Given the personality sketch, Adam's interests and traits align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, empathy, and understanding abstract concepts. Business administration does not closely align with these specific interests and traits. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in business administration is relatively low.

On the other hand, agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work. Therefore, the probability that Adam was enrolled in this field is relatively high.

Here is the estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
