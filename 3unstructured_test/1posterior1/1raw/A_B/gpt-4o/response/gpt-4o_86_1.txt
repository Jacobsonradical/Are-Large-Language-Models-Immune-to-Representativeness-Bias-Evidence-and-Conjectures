Based on the personality traits and interests described, it seems more likely that Adam would be enrolled in a field closely related to his curiosity about nature, plants, and animals. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also suggest he would value a field with a tangible, practical impact, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Business administration is less likely given his interests and personality sketch. 

Here is my best estimate:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
