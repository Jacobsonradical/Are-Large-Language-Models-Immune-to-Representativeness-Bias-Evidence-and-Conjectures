Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems he is more likely to have chosen a field that aligns with his interests in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He also values hard work and dedication. Based on these factors, here is an estimate of the probabilities:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's strong affinity for nature, plants, and animals makes agricultural and veterinary science a more probable field for him to pursue than business administration. The latter seems less likely given his described interests and empathetic nature.
