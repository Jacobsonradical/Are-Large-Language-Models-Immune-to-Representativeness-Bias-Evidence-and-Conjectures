Based on Adam's personality sketch, he is described as having a genuine curiosity about nature, a love for animals, and a strong appreciation for hard work and dedication. His high intelligence and interest in abstract concepts also align with fields that require in-depth understanding and problem-solving skills. Given this information, it's reasonable to estimate the probabilities as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

Adam's interests and personality traits suggest he is much more likely to pursue a field that aligns with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy, making agricultural and veterinary science a more probable choice. However, there is still a small chance that he could be in business administration, perhaps with a focus on agricultural business or environmental management.
