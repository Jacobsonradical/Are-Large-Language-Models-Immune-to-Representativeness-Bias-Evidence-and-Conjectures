Based on Adam's personality sketch, his high empathy, love for animals, curiosity about nature, and appreciation for hard work suggest a strong alignment with agricultural and veterinary science.

Therefore, the probability of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science is estimated to be significantly higher.
