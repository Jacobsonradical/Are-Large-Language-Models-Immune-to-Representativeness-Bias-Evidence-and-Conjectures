Explanation: Based on Adam's personality sketch, he exhibits a strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, which aligns well with fields such as agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and love for animals further increase the likelihood that he would choose a field where he can work closely with nature and contribute to the well-being of animals.

On the other hand, while there is no specific information suggesting an interest or aptitude in business administration, his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts mean he could potentially succeed in any field. However, the presence of clear markers indicating a stronger fit for agricultural and veterinary science makes it less likely that he would choose business administration.
