Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's interests and characteristics align more closely with fields related to nature, animals, and abstract concepts. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Adam is more likely to be enrolled in a field like agricultural and veterinary science than in business administration.

Here is the probability estimate:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These estimates are based on the alignment between Adam's personality traits and the nature of these fields of study.
