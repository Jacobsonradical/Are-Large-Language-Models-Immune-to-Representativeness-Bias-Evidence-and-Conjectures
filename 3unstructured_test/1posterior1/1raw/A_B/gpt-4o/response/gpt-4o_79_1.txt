Given the personality sketch of Adam, I will estimate the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields.

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

The higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science is based on Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, strong empathy, and deep love for animals, which align closely with the interests and content of this field. Business administration, meanwhile, seems less aligned with Adam's described characteristics.
