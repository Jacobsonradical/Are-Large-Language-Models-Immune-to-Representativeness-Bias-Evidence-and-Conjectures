Based on Adamâ€™s personality sketch and interests, the estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following fields is as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's deep love for nature, plants, and animals, combined with his empathy and understanding, strongly suggests a likelihood of involvement in a field like agricultural and veterinary science. On the other hand, there seems to be little in the sketch that would push him towards business administration, resulting in a much lower probability for that field.
