Given the provided personality sketch of Adam, here's my estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

This estimation is based on Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which aligns significantly with agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy and appreciation for hard work also support this alignment. On the other hand, there is little in the personality sketch to suggest an inclination towards business administration.
