Based on the personality sketch provided, it seems more likely that Adam would be drawn to a field that aligns with his love for nature, plants, animals, and his appreciation for hard work and dedication. Therefore, it seems less probable that he would be enrolled in business administration, which typically focuses more on corporate, financial, and managerial aspects.

Here is my best estimate of the probabilities:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
