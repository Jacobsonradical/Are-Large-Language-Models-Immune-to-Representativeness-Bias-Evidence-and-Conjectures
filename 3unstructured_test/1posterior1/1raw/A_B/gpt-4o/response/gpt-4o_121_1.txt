Based on Adam's personality sketch, his strong curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work align well with a field like agricultural and veterinary science. His warm heart and empathy also suggest a potential career working with animals or in natural sciences. Conversely, while his intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be beneficial in business administration, the sketch does not indicate specific traits or interests that align closely with that field, leading to a lower probability.
