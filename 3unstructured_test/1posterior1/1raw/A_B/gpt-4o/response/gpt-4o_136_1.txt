Based on the personality sketch of Adam, the probability assessments for his enrollment in the two fields are:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and strong empathy align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science than with business administration. While it is not impossible for someone with these characteristics to enroll in business administration, it seems less likely based on the provided description.
