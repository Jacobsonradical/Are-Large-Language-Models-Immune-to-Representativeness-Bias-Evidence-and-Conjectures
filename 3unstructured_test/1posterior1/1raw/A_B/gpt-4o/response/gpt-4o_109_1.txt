Given Adam's deep love for animals, curiosity about nature, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, it seems quite likely that he would pursue a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His personality and interests align closely with the themes of this area of study.

On the other hand, business administration typically attracts individuals with interests that differ somewhat from Adam's. While it's not impossible, his profile does not strongly suggest an interest in business administration. Hence, the probability for business administration is lower.
