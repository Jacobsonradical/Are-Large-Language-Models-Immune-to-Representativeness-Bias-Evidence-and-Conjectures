Given Adam's described interests and personality traits — a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, a deep love for animals, and empathy — it seems much more likely he would be enrolled in a field closely related to nature and animal sciences, such as agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and abstract thinking capabilities also align well with the scientific and practical challenges found in this field. Business administration seems significantly less probable based on the provided personality sketch.
