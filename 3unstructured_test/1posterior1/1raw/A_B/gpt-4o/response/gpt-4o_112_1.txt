Based on the personality sketch of Adam, my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields in 2021 is as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Given Adam's strong empathy, love for animals, and genuine curiosity about nature and plants, it is more likely that he is involved in a field closely related to his interests, such as agricultural and veterinary science, rather than business administration.
