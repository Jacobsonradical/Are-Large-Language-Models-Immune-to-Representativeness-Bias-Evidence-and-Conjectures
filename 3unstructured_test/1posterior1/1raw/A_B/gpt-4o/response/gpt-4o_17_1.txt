Sure, based on Adam's personality sketch and interests, here is my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, his warm heart, strong empathy, and deep love for animals make it more likely that he would pursue a field related to agriculture or veterinary science rather than business administration.
