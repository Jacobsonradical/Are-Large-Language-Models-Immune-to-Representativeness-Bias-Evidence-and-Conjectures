Based on the personality sketch of Adam, his strong curiosity about nature, empathy for animals, intelligence, and appreciation for hard work, it seems more likely that he would be enrolled in a field closely related to his interests in nature and animals.

Therefore, my estimates would be:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
