Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam's attributes such as a genuine curiosity about nature and its plants, a deep love for animals, strong empathy, and high intelligence suggest a closer alignment with fields related to the environment and life sciences as opposed to business administration. Therefore, I will estimate the probability accordingly.

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.2
}
```

These probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in agricultural and veterinary science due to his interests and personality traits, while still acknowledging the slim possibility of his enrollment in business administration.
