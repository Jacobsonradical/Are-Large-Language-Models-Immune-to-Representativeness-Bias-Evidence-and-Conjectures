Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants, combined with his deep love for animals, makes it quite likely that he would be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be advantageous in this field, where complex biological and ecological systems are studied. On the other hand, his traits do not strongly align with business administration, where a different set of skills and interests are typically more pertinent.
