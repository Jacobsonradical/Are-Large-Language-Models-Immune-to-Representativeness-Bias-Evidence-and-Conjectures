Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, certain traits and interests can inform an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields of study. Given his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication, it seems more likely that he would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. The latter does not closely align with his described interests and personality traits.

Here are the estimates:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
```

These values are based on the strong alignment of Adam's interests and personality with the field of agricultural and veterinary science, compared to the relatively weaker alignment with business administration.
