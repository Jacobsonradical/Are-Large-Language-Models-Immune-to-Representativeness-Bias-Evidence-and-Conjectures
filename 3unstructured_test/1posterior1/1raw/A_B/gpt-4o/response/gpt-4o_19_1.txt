Based on Adam's personality sketch, it is apparent that his interests and traits align more closely with fields that involve nature, plants, animals, and a deep appreciation for hard work. These aspects strongly suggest a fit with agricultural and veterinary science rather than with business administration, which typically focuses on analytical, financial, and organizational tasks. 

Therefore, my best estimate of the probabilities is as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
