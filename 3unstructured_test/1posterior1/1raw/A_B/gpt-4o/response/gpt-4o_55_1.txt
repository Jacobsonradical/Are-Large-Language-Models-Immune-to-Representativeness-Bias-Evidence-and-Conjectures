Based on the personality sketch of Adam:

- He has a genuine curiosity about nature and its various plants.
- He has a warm heart, strong empathy, and a deep love for animals.
- He enjoys solving puzzles and is highly intelligent, good at understanding abstract concepts.
- He has a strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication.

Given these characteristics, Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals strongly aligns with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. His empathy, warm heart, and love for animals further support an inclination towards this field. 

On the other hand, while his intelligence and appreciation for hard work are qualities that can be beneficial in business administration, other aspects of his personality (such as his curiosity about nature and love for animals) do not directly align with this field.

Therefore, the probability estimates would be as follows:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}
