Given the information about Adam's personality and interests, here is my best estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his love for animals, makes it quite probable that he might have chosen a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His interest in puzzles and high intelligence also suggest an aptitude for such a scientific and research-oriented field.

On the other hand, there is little in the personality sketch to indicate a strong inclination toward business administration. While it is possible that someone with high intelligence and appreciation for hard work could be in this field, there is no specific evidence in the sketch to suggest that Adam would be naturally drawn to business administration.
