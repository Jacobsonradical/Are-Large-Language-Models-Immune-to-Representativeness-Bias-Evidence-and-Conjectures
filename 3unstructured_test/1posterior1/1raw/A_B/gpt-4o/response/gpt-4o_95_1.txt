Based on the description provided, here is my best estimate for the probability that Adam was enrolled in the specified fields:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.75,
  "business administration": 0.1
}

Given his genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, along with his empathy and appreciation for hard work, it is highly probable that Adam would be drawn to a field like agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, the traits described do not strongly align with typical characteristics or interests that would suggest a high probability of enrollment in business administration.
