Based on the given personality sketch, it's reasonable to estimate that Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, solving puzzles, and empathy align more closely with a field like agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration.

Therefore, the probability estimates could be:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.15,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.65
}
```

These estimates reflect the higher likelihood of Adam being enrolled in a field related to his interests and personality traits.
