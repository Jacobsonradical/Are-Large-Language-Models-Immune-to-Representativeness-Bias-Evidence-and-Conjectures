Based on the personality sketch of Adam, particularly his strong curiosity about nature, plants, and animals, as well as his empathy and intelligence, it seems more likely that he would be interested in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science. His personality traits and interests align well with the themes present in this field. Conversely, there is no significant indication that his interests align with business administration.

Here is my estimate:

  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
