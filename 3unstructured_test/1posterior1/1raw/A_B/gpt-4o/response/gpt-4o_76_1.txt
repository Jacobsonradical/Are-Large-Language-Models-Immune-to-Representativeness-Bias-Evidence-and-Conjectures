Given the personality sketch of Adam, it seems more likely that he was enrolled in a field closely related to his interests in nature, plants, animals, and abstract concepts. Agricultural and veterinary science aligns well with his genuine curiosity about nature and his love for animals. Meanwhile, business administration appears less aligned with his described characteristics and interests.

Considering these factors, the estimates would be:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
