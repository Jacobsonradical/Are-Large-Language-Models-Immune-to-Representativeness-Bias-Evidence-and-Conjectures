Given Adam's personality sketch, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication strongly align with agricultural and veterinary science. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit a range of fields, but the specific interests and values he exhibits make agricultural and veterinary science a much likelier match compared to business administration. His quiet and empathetic nature does not strongly suggest a fit with the typical traits associated with the business administration field.
