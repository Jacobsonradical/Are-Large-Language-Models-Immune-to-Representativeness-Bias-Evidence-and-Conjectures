Based on Adam's personality sketch, it seems that his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and appreciation for hard work are more likely to align with interests in agricultural and veterinary science rather than business administration. However, without more information, we can't completely rule out any field. Here is my best estimate:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7
}
