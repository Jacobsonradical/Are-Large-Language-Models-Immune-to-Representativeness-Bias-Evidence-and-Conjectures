Given Adam's personality sketch, with his curiosity about nature, love for animals, empathy, and intelligence in understanding abstract concepts, here's my estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

```json
{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.7,
  "business administration": 0.1
}
```
Adam's traits strongly align with fields that involve understanding nature and working with animals, making agricultural and veterinary science a more likely choice. His traits do not strongly align with those typically associated with business administration, though it's still possible, hence the lower probability for the latter.
