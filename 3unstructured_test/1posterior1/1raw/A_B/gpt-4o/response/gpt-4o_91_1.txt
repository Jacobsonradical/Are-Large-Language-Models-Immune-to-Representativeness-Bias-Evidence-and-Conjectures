Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, the following are my estimates for the probability that he was enrolled in the given fields:

{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.8
}

Adam's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and empathy strongly align with the field of agricultural and veterinary science. While it is not impossible for someone with these traits to be in business administration, it seems less likely given the description.
