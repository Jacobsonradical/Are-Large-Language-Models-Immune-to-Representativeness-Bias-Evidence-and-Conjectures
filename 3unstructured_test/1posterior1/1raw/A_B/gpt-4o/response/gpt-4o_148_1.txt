Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, my best estimate of the probability is as follows:

```json
{
  "business administration": 0.1,
  "agricultural and veterinary science": 0.6
}
```

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, strong empathy, deep love for animals, and appreciation for hard work and dedication suggest that he is much more likely to be enrolled in a field related to agricultural and veterinary science than business administration. His inclination toward solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts could align with either field, but his specific interests and characteristics strongly point towards agricultural and veterinary science.
