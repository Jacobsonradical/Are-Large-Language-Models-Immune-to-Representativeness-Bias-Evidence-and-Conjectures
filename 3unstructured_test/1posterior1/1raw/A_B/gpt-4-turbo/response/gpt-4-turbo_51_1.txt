Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, there are relevant aspects to consider when estimating the probability of his enrollment in specific graduate fields. Adam has a genuine curiosity about nature and plants, and his deep love for animals points toward interests aligned with environmental and life sciences. A subject having a strong understanding and appreciation of hard work may be a trait valued in any discipline but doesn't specifically align with business administration.

Given these characteristics:

1. Business Administration: Adam's profile does not specifically align with typical interests associated with business administration, such as a focus on management, finance, or marketing. While it's not impossible for a person of Adam's characteristics to be enrolled in a business administration program, it seems less probable given the information provided.

2. Agricultural and Veterinary Science: Adam's interest in nature, plants, and animals, combined with a preference for solving puzzles, suggests a strong alignment with fields that involve environmental concerns, animal care, and scientific research. Agricultural and veterinary sciences would resonate with his love for animals and nature, making it more probable as his field of study.

Estimations:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agenerative and veterinary science": "0.7"
