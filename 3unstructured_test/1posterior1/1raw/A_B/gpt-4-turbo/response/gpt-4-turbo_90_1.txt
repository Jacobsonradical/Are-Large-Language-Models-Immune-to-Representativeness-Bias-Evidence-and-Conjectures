Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}

Explanation:
- The high probability (0.8) assigned to "agricultural and veterinary science" stems from Adam's noted curiosity about nature and plants, and a deep love for animals, which aligns well with studies in fields such as agriculture, forestry, environmental science, or veterinary medicine.
- The lower probability (0.2) for "business administration" reflects the lesser emphasis on skills and interests typically associated with business studies, such as leadership in management, financial acumen, or market analysis in the description provided. While Adam possesses high intelligence and could likely succeed in many fields, the description leans more heavily towards natural sciences and empathy-related attributes rather than business-focused characteristics.
