Given Adam's interests and characteristics, here is the estimated probability that he was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's curiosity about nature, his love for animals, and possibly an appreciation of plant life. These are key interests for someone who may be studying agricultural or veterinary sciences.
  
- **Business Administration**: Although Adam is described as highly intelligent and capable of understanding abstract concepts, there is no direct mention of interests typically associated with business studies, such as economics, finance, or managerial practices. His empathetic nature and problem-solving skills could be advantageous in business, but these are not as strongly indicative of an inclination towards this field as his other interests are towards agricultural and veterinary science.

With these considerations, the estimated probabilities are as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
}
