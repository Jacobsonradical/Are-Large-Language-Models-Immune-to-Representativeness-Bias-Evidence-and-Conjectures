Based on the personality sketch of Adam, who displays a strong interest in nature and its elements, especially plants, has empathy and a love for animals, and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, it's possible to infer his probable field of study. While the field of business administration tends to attract individuals with a focus on management, finance, and leadership opportunities and might not directly align with his nature-oriented interests, agricultural and veterinary sciences align closely with his curiosity and affection for nature and animals.
