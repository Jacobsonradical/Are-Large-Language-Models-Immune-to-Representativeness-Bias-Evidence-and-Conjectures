Based on the personality sketch provided for Adam, it appears that there might be a stronger likelihood for him to pursue a field related to his interests and characteristics. Here is a reasoned estimation:

- The curiosity about nature and various plants, along with a deep love for animals, suggests a potential alignment with agricultural and veterinary science. Such disciplines often attract individuals who have an affinity for the natural world and seek to understand and work with plants and animals. 

- His traits such as solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts, while valuable in many fields, do not directly suggest an inclination towards business administration, unless there is a specific inclination towards the analytical aspects of business like strategy or operations management. However, without more information on his interests in economics, finance, management, or entrepreneurship, a direct connection is less obvious.

Taking these factors into consideration, I would estimate the probabilities as follows:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7",
  "business administration": "0.2"
} 

These figures reflect a higher probability for agricultural and veterinary science based on the alignment of his interests and characteristics, and a lower probability for business administration due to less information suggesting a fit with that field.
