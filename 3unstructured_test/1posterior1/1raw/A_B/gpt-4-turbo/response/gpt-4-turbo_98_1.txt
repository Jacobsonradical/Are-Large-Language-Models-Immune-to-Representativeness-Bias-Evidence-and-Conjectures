Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam shows a strong inclination towards nature, plants, and a love for animals, alongside a noted interest in puzzle-solving and an understanding of abstract concepts, which may imply a strong analytical mindset. Here's the estimated probability for each field:

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Given Adam's enthusiasm for nature and animals, and considering his intellectual traits which could be beneficial in rigorous scientific fields, there is a higher likelihood he might be enrolled in a program related to Agricultural and Veterinary Science. However, graduate studies in these fields are less common compared to others like Business, Engineering, or Medicine. Thus, while his personality aligns well with these studies, overall fewer students enroll in them.
  
- **Business Administration**: Adam's interests seem less aligned with business on the surface, as his described traits and inclinations lean more towards natural and scientific fields rather than business management, finance, or marketing. Analytical skills could indeed be useful in business studies, but no direct connection to business themes is mentioned.

With this analysis, we can make an estimate, but remember, these are not definitive probabilities and are based on personality alignment rather than actual enrollment data.
