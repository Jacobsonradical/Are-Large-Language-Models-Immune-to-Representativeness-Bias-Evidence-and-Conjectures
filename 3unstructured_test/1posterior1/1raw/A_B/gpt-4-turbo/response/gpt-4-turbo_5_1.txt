Given the personality sketch and interests of Adam, particularly his deep love for animals and curiosity about nature and various plants, it seems more likely that he would pursue a field related to these interests. These traits align more closely with agricultural and veterinary science, which involve studies on plant biology, animal care, ecology, and environmental conservation. 

On the other hand, business administration typically focuses on areas such as management, finance, marketing, and operations, which do not directly correlate with his mentioned interests and personality traits.

Therefore, the probabilities can be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
