Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam shows a clear inclination towards nature, animals, and the understanding of complex concepts. Here's a breakdown of how suitable each field might be for him:

1. Agricultural and veterinary science - This field aligns well with Adam's interests in plants, nature, and animals, as well as his strong empathy and warmth towards living beings. His intelligence and ability to grasp abstract concepts would also be beneficial in scientific aspects of this field. 

2. Business administration - While this field does require high intelligence and an understanding of abstract concepts, there is little in the personality sketch that directly links Adam to a strong inclination towards business administration, unless it specifically intersects with environmental or animal-related management. However, Adam's appreciation for hard work and dedication could be a good fit here too.

Based on these observations, here is the probability estimation:

{
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.85",
  "business administration": "0.30"
} 

These values reflect the apparent alignment of Adam's stated interests and abilities with the relevant academic fields, and do not add up to 1 as other fields are also potential fits for his graduate studies.
