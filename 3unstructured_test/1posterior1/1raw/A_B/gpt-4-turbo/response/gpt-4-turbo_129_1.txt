Based on the personality sketch provided, we can make some informed guesses about the fields of study that Adam may have pursued. His strong interest in nature and animals, along with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, suggest a leaning towards fields that involve natural sciences or animal care over business administration. Thus, the estimates might look like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

Here, a lower probability is assigned to business administration as the description did not indicate a strong alignment with typical business skills such as finance, management, or marketing competency. On the other hand, a higher probability is assigned to agricultural and veterinary science, reflecting his passion for nature and animals, which aligns well with these fields.
