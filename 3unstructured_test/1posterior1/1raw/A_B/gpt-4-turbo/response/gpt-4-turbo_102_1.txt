Based on the personality sketch provided, here's an estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the specified fields:

- The description highlights Adam's curiosity about nature and plants, his love for animals, along with his empathy and warmth. These traits strongly align with fields related to nature and care for living beings, making agricultural and veterinary science a much more likely field of study for him.
- Business administration, on the other hand, often requires strong analytical and leadership skills, but it typically does not align as directly with interests in nature, plants, and animals. While Adam's intelligence might make him adept at understanding complex business concepts, there's nothing explicitly in the description that ties him to the business field.

Thus, considering these pointers and how they align more naturally with agricultural and veterinary sciences than with business administration, the probabilities might look something like this:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
``` 

These estimates reflect the congruence between Adam's interests and personality traits with the typical focus areas of the mentioned fields of study.
