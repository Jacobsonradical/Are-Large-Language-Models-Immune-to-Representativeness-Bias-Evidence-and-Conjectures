Based on the personality sketch provided and Adam's interests and characteristics, here is an estimate of probabilities for his field of study in graduate school:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

Explanation:
- Adamâ€™s genuine curiosity about nature and love for animals suggest a higher likelihood for a field related to agriculture or veterinary science.
- His capacity for solving puzzles and handling abstract concepts could be applicable in many fields, including business administration, but they seem more aligned with scientific inquiry, which is more characteristic of agricultural and veterinary sciences. Additionally, these fields often involve complex problem-solving related to understanding ecosystems, animal behaviors, and plant biology.
- The traits described do not directly align with typical motivations for studying business administration, such as a focus on economics, management, or financial aspects of running businesses and organizations.
