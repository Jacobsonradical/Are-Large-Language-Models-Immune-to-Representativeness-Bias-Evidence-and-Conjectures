Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam displays traits that suggest a strong inclination towards nature, animals, and possibly some scientific or biological interests. These characteristics align closely with fields related to agriculture, veterinary science, or environmental studies. The information given does not strongly align with typical traits or interests commonly associated with business administration, which usually includes a focus on management, economics, leadership, and less direct emphasis on nature or animal welfare.

Taking into account these considerations, here is the estimated probability of Adam's enrollment in each specified field:

```json
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```

`business administration`: A low probability (0.1) is attributed here due to the lack of direct correlation between Adam's expressed interests and the core components of business administration.

`agricultural and veterinary science`: A higher probability (0.7) due to his love for animals, nature, and the attributes that align with a passion for the natural world, which is extensively covered in agricultural and veterinary sciences.
