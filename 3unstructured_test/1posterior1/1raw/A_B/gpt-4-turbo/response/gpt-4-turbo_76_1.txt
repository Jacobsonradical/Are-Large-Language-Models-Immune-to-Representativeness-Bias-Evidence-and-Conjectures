Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam has a strong affinity towards nature, a love for animals, and an interest in understanding complex concepts. Typically, these interests align well with fields that involve direct interaction with the natural environment or animal care, such as agricultural and veterinary sciences. His attributes like problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and understanding of abstract concepts could be useful in any specialized field of study; however, they do not distinctly point towards a particular preference for business administration, which often involves a focus on management, finance, and operational efficiencies.

Considering this, the probabilities for Adam's enrollment might be estimated as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}

This estimation reflects a higher likelihood for agricultural and veterinary science due to his expressed interests and personality traits that would naturally align with this field. Conversely, the lower probability for business administration is due to less direct alignment with his interests and personality traits as portrayed.
