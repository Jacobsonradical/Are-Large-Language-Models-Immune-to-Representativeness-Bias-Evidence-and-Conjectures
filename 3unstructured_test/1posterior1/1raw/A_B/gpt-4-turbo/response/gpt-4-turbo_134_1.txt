Based on the personality sketch of Adam, who shows a deep interest in nature and animals, it is more likely he would pursue a field related to those interests. His love for animals and plants suggests a stronger inclination towards studying fields that directly deal with these elements, such as agricultural and veterinary science. Conversely, his traits do not strongly hint at an interest in business administration, which often involves a focus on commerce, management, and organizational skills, which are not highlighted in the description. Therefore, the probabilities might align as follows:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
} 

This estimation reflects a higher probability of Adam studying agricultural and veterinary science based on his nature-centric interests and lower probability for business administration considering his personality and mentioned interests.
