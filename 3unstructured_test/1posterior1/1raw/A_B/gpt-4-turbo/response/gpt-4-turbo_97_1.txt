Based on the personality sketch provided of Adam, his interests and attributes can help us infer his possible fields of specialization. Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and various plants, along with his deep love for animals, strongly aligns him with fields related to nature and animal science. This suggests a high probability that his field of study might involve agricultural and veterinary sciences, which directly connects with his interests in plants and animals.

On the other hand, while Business Administration is a popular field, there's nothing specific in the description that aligns directly with business studies, which often focus on management, finance, marketing, and operations. Adam's traits and interests do not directly suggest a strong inclination towards business administration unless it is uniquely tied to environmental or agricultural business, which isnâ€™t specified.

Therefore, the estimated probabilities are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1", 
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
