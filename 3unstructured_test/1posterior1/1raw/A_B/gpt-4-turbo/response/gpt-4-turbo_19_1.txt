Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have a strong inclination towards nature, plants, and animals, coupled with high intelligence and an ability to understand abstract concepts. His interests align more closely with fields involving direct interaction or study of natural elements and living beings.

1. **Business Administration**: Typically, this field attracts individuals interested in management, finance, economics, and leadership roles within corporate or entrepreneurial settings. Adam's described interests and personality traits do not strongly align with the typical motivations and preferences of students in business administration. Although it's not impossible for him to pursue this field, it seems less likely based on the given description.

2. **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: This field aligns well with Adam's love and curiosity for nature, plants, and animals. Courses and research in agricultural and veterinary sciences would likely satisfy his interests in these areas and make use of his strong empathy towards living beings and his understanding of complex, abstract concepts (perhaps relating to biology, ecology, etc.).

Here's the estimation in the required format:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
} 

These values reflect a higher likelihood of Adam studying agricultural and veterinary sciences, based on his interests and personality profile, compared to business administration, which seems less probable.
