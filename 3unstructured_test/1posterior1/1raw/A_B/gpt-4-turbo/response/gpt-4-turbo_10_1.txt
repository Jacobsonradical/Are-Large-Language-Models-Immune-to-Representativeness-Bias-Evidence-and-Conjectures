Based on the personality sketch presented, Adam shows strong interests and qualities that align more closely with fields related to nature, plants, and perhaps animals, given his empathy and love for creatures. His high intelligence and capability with abstract concepts could indeed be an asset in many fields, but the specific interests highlighted suggest a stronger alignment with disciplines directly involving natural sciences rather than those related to business.

Thus, the estimated probabilities that Adam might be enrolled in these specific fields are:

{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
