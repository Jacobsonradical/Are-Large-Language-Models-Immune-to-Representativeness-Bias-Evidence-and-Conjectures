Based on the information provided in your request, Adam's interests and characteristics can offer some insight into the fields he might be studying. His curiosity about nature and plants, alongside a deep love for animals, suggests a stronger alignment with fields related to natural environments and animal care. His high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could be advantageous in any number of scholarly disciplines, though they particularly align with scientific study involving detailed and complex concepts, potentially applicable to agricultural and veterinary sciences. There's less indication from the description that he would be drawn to business administration, as it does not specifically align with his noted passions or skills.

Here is an estimated probability for Adam's graduate enrollment:

```
{
  "business administration": "0.1",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.7"
}
```
The value for business administration is low due to a lack of explicit connection between Adam's described traits and the typical focuses of business studies (such as finance, management, or marketing). In contrast, the value for agricultural and veterinary science is significantly higher, reflecting Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, which are central to these fields of study.
