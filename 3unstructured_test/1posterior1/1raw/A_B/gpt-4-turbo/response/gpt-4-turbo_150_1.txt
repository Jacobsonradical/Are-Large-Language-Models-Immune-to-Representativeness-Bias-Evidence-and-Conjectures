Given the personality sketch and interests of Adam, here's an estimate of the probability that he was enrolled in the specified fields of graduate study:

- **Business Administration**: Although Adam is described as highly intelligent and might be capable of excelling in business administration, there is no specific mention of an interest in business, finance, or management. Furthermore, Adam's noted empathy and love for animals may not directly lead him towards business administration, which typically demands a keen interest in business processes, economics, or leadership dynamics. Hence, the probability might be lower.

- **Agricultural and Veterinary Science**: Adam's genuine curiosity about nature and plants, alongside a strong empathy and love for animals, align closely with the interests typically found in students of agricultural and veterinary sciences. These fields require an appreciation for nature and living beings, which matches Adam's profile well. 

Based on these interpretations, the estimated probabilities could be:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "agricultural and veterinary science": "0.8"
}
