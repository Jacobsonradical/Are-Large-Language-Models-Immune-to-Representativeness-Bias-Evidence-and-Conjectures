Based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch, here is my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem-solving. These traits could potentially align with a field like computer science. However, without more specific information about his academic background or career interests, it's difficult to assign a high probability.

Business administration seems less likely given the information provided, as the sketch does not mention any strong interest in business, management, or related fields.

Please note that these are rough estimates based on limited data, and there could be many other graduate fields that align with Adam's interests and abilities.
