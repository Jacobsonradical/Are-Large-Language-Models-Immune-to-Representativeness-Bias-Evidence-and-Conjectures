Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each of the given fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

Based on Adam's personality profile, he seems more likely to be drawn to computer science compared to business administration, given his curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for abstract concepts and problem-solving. However, the probability is not extremely high, as his interests in nature, animals, and empathy suggest other potential fields as well, such as biology, zoology, veterinary science, etc. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile, but still possible. There are many other potential graduate fields not listed that could also align with his interests and traits.
