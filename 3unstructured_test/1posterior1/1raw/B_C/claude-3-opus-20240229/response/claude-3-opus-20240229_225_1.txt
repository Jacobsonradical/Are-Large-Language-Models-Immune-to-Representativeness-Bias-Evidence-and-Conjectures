Here is my estimate of the probabilities based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

The subject's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles suggest a higher likelihood of being enrolled in a computer science graduate program.

While the subject's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend itself to business administration, the personality sketch focuses more on qualities that align with computer science. However, business administration is still a reasonable possibility.
