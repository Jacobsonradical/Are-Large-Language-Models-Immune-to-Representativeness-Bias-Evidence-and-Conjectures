Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts could indicate an inclination towards a technical field like computer science. However, the description also emphasizes empathy, love of nature and animals which are less strongly associated with computer science.

The description doesn't include many traits that seem to align closely with business administration, such as leadership, competitiveness, or extroversion. The mention of appreciating hard work and dedication could apply to business somewhat.

Of course, there are many other possible graduate fields not listed. The personality sketch is also quite limited information to base this estimate on. So I have kept the probability estimates relatively low to reflect the high level of uncertainty involved in making this assessment based on the information provided.
