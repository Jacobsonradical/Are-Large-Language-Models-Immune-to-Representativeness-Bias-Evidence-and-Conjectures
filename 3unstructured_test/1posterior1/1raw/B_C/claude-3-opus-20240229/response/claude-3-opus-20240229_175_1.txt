Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves well to computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, animals and puzzles suggests he may have been more likely to pursue a field related to natural sciences, such as biology, ecology, or environmental science. Business administration seems less likely given his personality profile. However, there is limited information to go on, so these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty.
