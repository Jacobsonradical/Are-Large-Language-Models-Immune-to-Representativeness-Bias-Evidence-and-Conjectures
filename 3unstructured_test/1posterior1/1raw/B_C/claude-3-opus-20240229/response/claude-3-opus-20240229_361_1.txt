Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in each of the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The rationale behind these estimates:

1. Business administration: While Adam's strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be relevant to business administration, his genuine curiosity about nature, love for animals, and interest in abstract concepts suggest that he may be more inclined towards other fields. Therefore, a lower probability of 0.2 is assigned.

2. Computer science: Adam's high intelligence, ability to understand abstract concepts, and enjoyment of solving puzzles are traits that are often associated with individuals in the computer science field. These characteristics, combined with his quiet nature, suggest a higher probability of him being enrolled in computer science, hence the estimate of 0.6.

Please note that these are subjective estimates based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch and may not reflect the actual field of study Adam pursued.
