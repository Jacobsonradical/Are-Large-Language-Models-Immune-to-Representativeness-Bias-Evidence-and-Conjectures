Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the provided personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

While Adam's intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could align with computer science, his curiosity about nature, love of animals, and empathy suggest he may be more drawn to fields like biology, environmental science, psychology, or veterinary medicine. Business administration seems less likely given his interests and personality traits.
