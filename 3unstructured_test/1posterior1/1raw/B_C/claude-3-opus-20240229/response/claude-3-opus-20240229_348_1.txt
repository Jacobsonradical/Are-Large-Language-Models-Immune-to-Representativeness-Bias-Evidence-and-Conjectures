Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in graduate school:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

Based on Adam's personality traits of curiosity about nature, love of animals, empathy, and appreciation for hard work, fields related to biology, ecology, zoology, environmental science, or veterinary medicine seem more likely than computer science or business. His intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could lend themselves to many fields. Without more information about his specific interests and academic background, the probabilities for computer science and business administration seem relatively low compared to other possible graduate fields, but not zero since his abilities could be applied there. More context would help narrow down the most likely areas of study.
