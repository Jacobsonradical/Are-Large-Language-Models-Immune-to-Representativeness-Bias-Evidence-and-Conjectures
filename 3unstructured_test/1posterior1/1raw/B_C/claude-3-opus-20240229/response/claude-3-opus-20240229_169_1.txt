Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the mentioned fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, enjoyment of solving puzzles, high intelligence, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggest a higher probability of him being enrolled in a computer science graduate program. While his strong empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be valuable in business administration, the personality sketch leans more towards traits commonly associated with computer science students.
