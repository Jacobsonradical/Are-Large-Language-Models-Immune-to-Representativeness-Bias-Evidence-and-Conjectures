Based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch, here is my best estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The subject's curiosity about nature, love for animals, and ability to understand abstract concepts suggests a slightly higher probability of being enrolled in a scientific field like computer science compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about the subject's academic background and interests, these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty.
