Based on the provided personality sketch of Adam, here are my estimates for the probability of him being enrolled in the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Explanation:
Given Adam's strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, along with his high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts, he seems more likely to be enrolled in a field related to natural sciences or computer science rather than business administration. His love for solving puzzles also suggests an inclination towards analytical and problem-solving disciplines like computer science.
