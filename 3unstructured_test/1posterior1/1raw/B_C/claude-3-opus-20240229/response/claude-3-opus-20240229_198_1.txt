Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoyment of puzzles, high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could fit well with studying computer science. However, the sketch also emphasizes Adam's love of nature, animals, empathy and appreciation of hard work, which seem less directly related to computer science.

Business administration seems like a lower probability based on the personality description. While intelligence and hard work are relevant, the specific interests in nature, animals, puzzles and abstract concepts don't have a strong connection to typical business curricula.

Of course, these are just rough estimates based on limited information. Many other fields of graduate study are also possible that may align with aspects of Adam's personality and interests.
