Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.2",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests Adam has strong intellectual curiosity, problem-solving skills, and ability to understand abstract concepts, which could align with computer science. However, his love of nature, animals and puzzles doesn't necessarily point strongly to computer science.

Business administration seems less likely given his personality. The sketch doesn't mention anything about leadership, management, finance or other common business skills and interests.

Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields Adam could have specialized in, such as biology, psychology, veterinary science, environmental science, etc. that may align well with his interests and traits. The probabilities I provided for the two specified fields are my best estimates based solely on the limited information in the personality sketch.
