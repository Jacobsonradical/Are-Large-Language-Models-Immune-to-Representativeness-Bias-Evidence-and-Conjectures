Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the mentioned fields:

{
  "computer science": "0.15",
  "business administration": "0.05"
}

While Adam's high intelligence and ability to understand abstract concepts could suit him well for computer science, his strong interest in nature, plants, and animals suggests he may be more inclined towards fields like biology, environmental science, or zoology. Business administration seems less likely given his personal traits and interests.
