Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science in graduate school:

{
  "business administration": "0.25",
  "computer science": "0.60"
}

Based on Adam's personality sketch, he seems to have strong analytical abilities, a curious mind, and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with the field of computer science. His love of nature and animals is less directly relevant to either field.

While he could potentially apply his intelligence and work ethic to business administration, the personality description provides fewer clear indicators pointing in that direction compared to computer science. So I estimate a higher probability for computer science enrollment.
