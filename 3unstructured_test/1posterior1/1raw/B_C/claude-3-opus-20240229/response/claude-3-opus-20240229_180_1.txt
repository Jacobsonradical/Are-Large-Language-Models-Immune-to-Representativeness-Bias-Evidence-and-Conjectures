Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science in graduate school:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on Adam's personality traits of high intelligence, curiosity about nature, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts, I believe there is a fairly high probability (around 60%) that he specialized in computer science. His logical mind and puzzle-solving skills would lend themselves well to this field. 

While it's possible he studied business administration, I consider this less likely (around 20% probability) given his strong empathy, love of animals and nature. Business programs tend to focus more on finance, management and strategy rather than nature and abstract concepts. However, his appreciation for hard work and dedication could serve him well in business.

Of course, there are many other graduate fields he could have specialized in, so my total probability estimate does not add up to 1. This is just my best guess based on the limited information provided about Adam's personality and interests. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to share!
