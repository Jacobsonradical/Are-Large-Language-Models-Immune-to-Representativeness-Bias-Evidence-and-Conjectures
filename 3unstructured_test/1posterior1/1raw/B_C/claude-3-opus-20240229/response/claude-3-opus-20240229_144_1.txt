Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the given fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The rationale for my estimates:

Adam's genuine curiosity about nature, plants, and his love for animals suggest a potential inclination towards biological or environmental sciences. However, these fields were not listed among the options.

His enjoyment of solving puzzles and his high intelligence with an ability to understand abstract concepts indicate a strong likelihood of him being drawn to computer science, which often involves problem-solving and working with abstract concepts.

While his strong understanding and appreciation for hard work and dedication could be applicable to business administration, the personality sketch does not provide strong evidence of an interest in business-related topics. Therefore, I assigned a lower probability to business administration compared to computer science.
