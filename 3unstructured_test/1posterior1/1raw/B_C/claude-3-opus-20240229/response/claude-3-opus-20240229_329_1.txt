Based on the given personality sketch, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, enjoys problem-solving, and has a high intelligence with an understanding of abstract concepts. These traits align more closely with a field like computer science rather than business administration.

However, it's important to note that personality traits do not always directly correlate with the choice of graduate field, as there can be many other factors influencing the decision, such as career prospects, personal experiences, or specific research interests.
