Here is my estimate based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Given Adam's strong interest in nature, puzzles, abstract concepts, and high intelligence, I believe he has a higher probability of being enrolled in a computer science graduate program compared to business administration. However, his empathy and appreciation for hard work and dedication could also lend themselves to business administration to some degree.
