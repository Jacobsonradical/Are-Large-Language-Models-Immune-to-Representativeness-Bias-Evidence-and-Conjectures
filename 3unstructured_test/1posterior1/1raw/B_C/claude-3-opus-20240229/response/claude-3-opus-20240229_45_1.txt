Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the mentioned fields:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, animals, and abstract concepts. He is also described as having high intelligence. These traits align more closely with a field like computer science, which involves problem-solving, abstract thinking, and a deep understanding of complex systems.

While business administration requires dedication and hard work, which Adam seems to appreciate, his empathy, love for animals, and curiosity about nature do not strongly indicate an inclination towards this field.

Please note that these probabilities are rough estimates based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch and do not consider other factors such as personal preferences, experiences, or opportunities that may influence an individual's choice of graduate field.
