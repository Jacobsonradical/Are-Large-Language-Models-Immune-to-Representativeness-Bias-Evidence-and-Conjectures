Here is my estimate of the probabilities, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The appreciation of nature, love of animals, and empathy suggest fields other than computer science or business administration may be more likely. However, the interest in puzzles and abstract concepts does point to a reasonable probability of computer science. The appreciation for hard work and dedication could fit with either field to some degree. Overall, I estimate a somewhat higher probability for computer science than business administration given the details provided, but both are definitely minority probabilities compared to other possible fields not mentioned.
