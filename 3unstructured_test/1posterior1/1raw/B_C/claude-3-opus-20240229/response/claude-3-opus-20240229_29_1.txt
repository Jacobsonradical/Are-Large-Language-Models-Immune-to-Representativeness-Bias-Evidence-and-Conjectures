Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration or computer science in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch provided, Adam seems to have strong analytical skills, a deep curiosity about the natural world, and an aptitude for understanding abstract concepts. These traits align well with a specialization in computer science.

While it's possible he could have pursued business administration, his love for nature, animals, and puzzle-solving suggests a slightly lower probability of this field compared to computer science. However, business administration is still a possibility given his strong work ethic and dedication.
