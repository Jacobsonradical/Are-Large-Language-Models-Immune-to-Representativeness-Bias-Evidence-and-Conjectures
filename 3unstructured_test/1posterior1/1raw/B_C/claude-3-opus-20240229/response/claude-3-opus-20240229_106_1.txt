Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in each field based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.25",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality traits of curiosity, enjoying puzzles, high intelligence and understanding abstract concepts suggest Adam may be more likely to pursue a technical field like computer science compared to business administration. However, business administration is still a possibility given his strong work ethic. Overall though, the background doesn't provide strong evidence for either field, so I've estimated relatively low probabilities for both, leaving open the strong possibility he specialized in a different graduate field altogether given his varied interests.
