Based on the personality sketch provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Adam was enrolled in the following graduate fields in 2021:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, abstract concepts, and problem-solving. While these traits could be applicable to various fields, they might indicate a slightly higher probability of pursuing computer science compared to business administration. However, without more specific information about his academic background and career aspirations, it is difficult to assign high probabilities to any particular field.
