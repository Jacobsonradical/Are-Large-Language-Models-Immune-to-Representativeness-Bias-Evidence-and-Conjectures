Based on the limited information provided in the personality sketch, here is my estimate:

{
  "computer science": "0.3",
  "business administration": "0.1"
}

The personality sketch suggests that Adam has a strong interest in nature, plants, and animals, as well as an affinity for solving puzzles and understanding abstract concepts. This could indicate a leaning towards scientific fields, such as biology, environmental science, or even computer science, given the problem-solving aspect.

However, the information provided does not strongly point towards business administration, as there is no mention of interests or skills typically associated with that field, such as leadership, economics, or management.

Please note that these estimates are highly speculative given the limited information available, and there could be many other factors influencing Adam's choice of graduate field that are not mentioned in the personality sketch.
