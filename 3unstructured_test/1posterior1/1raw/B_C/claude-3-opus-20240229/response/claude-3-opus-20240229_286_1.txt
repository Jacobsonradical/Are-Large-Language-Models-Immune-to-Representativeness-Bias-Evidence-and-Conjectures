Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in computer science or business administration in graduate school, based on the given personality sketch:

{
  "computer science": "0.6",
  "business administration": "0.3"
}

While Adam's curiosity, intelligence, and aptitude for understanding abstract concepts could suit him well for computer science, his love of nature and animals along with his empathy and warm heart make me think he may have chosen to study something related to biology, ecology, or veterinary medicine. Business administration seems less likely given his personality, but his appreciation for hard work and dedication could lend itself to that field. There are many other possibilities though, so I've assigned probabilities significantly less than 1.
