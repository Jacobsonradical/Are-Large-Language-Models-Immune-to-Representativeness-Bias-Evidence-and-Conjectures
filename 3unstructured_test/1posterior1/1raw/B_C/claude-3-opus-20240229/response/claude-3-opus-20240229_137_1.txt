Here is my estimate of the probabilities that Adam was enrolled in business administration and computer science in 2021:

{
  "business administration": "0.2",
  "computer science": "0.6"
}

Based on the personality sketch, Adam seems more likely to be drawn to a field like computer science that involves abstract concepts, problem-solving, and intelligence. Business administration is certainly possible but seems less probable given his described traits and interests. Of course, there are many other potential graduate fields he could have pursued as well.
